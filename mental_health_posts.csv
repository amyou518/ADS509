My daughter is scaring me tonight. No idea how to help.,925,0.98,1702090229.0,"My daughter (10) very suddenly this evening said she feels like she's in a dream/ like she's not real/ like she's a ghost.

I had her take a shower, brushed her hair and she put on her jammies. Tucked her bed with beach sounds and told her to relax and picture being at the beach. Walked in a couple of minutes later and she's crying.

I'm really worried but completely clueless. My husband thinks it's her ADHD/Adderall, but this has never happened before. She has been very moody and temperamental lately.

My mother having sex with me in the same room damaged my relationship with sex,610,0.97,1696888783.0,"When I was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend. Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.

Saw someone die yesterday,562,0.99,1682901107.0,"Yesterday while I getting on the bus after work , a boy that was getting off stepped into traffic without looking and got hit by a car that sent him flying in front of the bus. It happened so fast that I didn’t even finish paying for my ticket yet. Everyone came up to try and help him until the ambulance got there but the amount of blood and how far the car launched him, I knew he wasn’t going to make it. The EMTs got there, checked his pulse and immediately got him on the stretcher and used the defibrillators. The ambulance rode off. No sirens. No lights. No nothing. I got up and just walked back to my job in total shock. All I could and have been thinking about is the brief couple of seconds where I was able to see him before he died. Looked like a teenager and he looked like he just got off of work himself. I especially remember his long dreadlocs because some of them had ripped out and was laying in the street. Tried to tell my family what I saw and it seemed like no one cared, especially my mom. She seemed more upset that she had to come pick me up while she doing Lyft. After the shock faded I thought I was okay until I tried going to sleep. That entire part of my day kept playing back on loop. Couldn’t sleep so tried watching tv but I couldn’t pay attention to what was going on. Then I started thinking about all the times I’ve stepped into the street without thinking for hours. My body eventually gave out and went to sleep. Woke up feeling like shit so I asked my mom for a ride to work. During the ride she asked me why I looked depressed. Didn’t say anything. Then she asked me if I was able to complete some chore yesterday and when I said no she started going off on me. Telling me that I’m lazy and I don’t care about anything. I got angry and yelled at her and told her imma still fucked up from yesterday and she told me to “toughen up and leave that shit in the past. You didn’t know him “ after that I asked her to just drop me off wherever because I just was sick of her attitude. I eventually got to work but I had to walk past the spot he got hit at. I cried. Couldn’t help it. Felt like a total bitch but I just couldn’t help it. My entire shift was just me mourning a total stranger. I know it’s probably stupid but it’s just how I am.

I think I have PTSD from my wife giving birth.,460,0.95,1704735467.0,"Let me start with I know that what a woman goes through in labor is incredibly hard and challenging on them both mentally and physically. 

So my wife got induced Friday morning and things progressed fine all day. They gave her an epidural at 4PM Friday and things were good. Around midnight the baby’s heart rate dropped which caused my wife’s to drop.. 

We had every nurse on the floor in our room in seconds. They flipped her on hands and knees, woke the on-site surgeon and started prepping the OR and a crash team. They got her and the baby stabilized in about 15 min. So that was at midnight. 

She labored through until it caused too much stress on her body so they sedated her and put her on oxygen for a few hours around 4 AM Saturday. She progressed to a little over 9cm. 

Around 9:30AM Saturday she gradually stopped having contractions and essentially going backwards.

 They ended having to doing an emergency c section at 11ish. 

When the baby came out he wasn’t breathing and didn’t for the first 5 min. They had to resuscitate him all the while they had a hard time stopping my wife’s bleeding. So. Much. Blood…. It was all over.. The drs discovered some infection while they had her opened up and had to look for more infection which took them longer. I watched them pull my wife’s insides out asking for help with the bleeding and the NICU nurses flip my child’s lifeless body around to get him breathing. 

So I bounced around the operating room  between my wife and child checking on them for like 20 minutes being completely helpless. 

Both baby and mama have gotten the all clear and are at home recovering. No immediate issues with either of them.  I know it’s silly to be upset because we came home and are doing okay when so many people don’t get that opportunity. I just can’t get the OR out of my head. It’s playing over and over.

I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],443,0.96,1692390332.0,"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected.

am i in the wrong for reporting a consensual sexual encounter?,432,0.95,1686266074.0,"so basically i (21f) was baker acted (for those who don’t know it’s a mandatory 72 hour hospital stay for mental health) after, in my case, a suicide attempt. the hospital brought me to the psych ward, and i was put on suicide watch overnight there at 10pm. the guy (27m) who was the one watching me immediately started flirting, making super sexual comments, asking to see my body, etc. he was hot and i was in such a dark place so obviously i played along. like when he came in i was crying and saying how worthless i felt, etc. anyways, he started saying how much he wanted to have sex with me and how much he wanted to kiss me, so eventually he told me that if i went into the bathroom he would “have to follow me” since that was part of the suicide watch. in the bathroom we made out, and did other things, but not actual sex. this went on basically all night (10pm-7am), having sexual conversations, making out, talking about how we would meet up when i got out (he would get me pregnant and we would run away together), he got my phone number, etc. he gave me a fake name, and i later found out that he was married with a child. 

it was all consensual in the moment, like i never told him no, but thinking back on it i feel like he took advantage of the mental state i was in, and his position of power to get what he wanted. it feels like when a police officer gets with someone they arrested.

I held a child as he died yesterday. I work as an EMT-B running 911 calls on a medic unit. We had car crash with 3 deaths. Both parents and an infant. The one child was still alive when we arrived.

All of my professors have been very supportive and understanding except for my chem professor. He said it’s “part of the job” and my mental health is not an excuse to miss an exam.

""you should"" ""why dont you"" but when I reply that I don't have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do, they reply that I'm just lazzy and privileged.

 I felt weird about it but didn’t say anything. I would also lay down in the bed with her and she would start touching my inner thighs but nothing further.

He was always loving and affectionate towards me and our kids.

My parents were having sex next to me and it fucked me up,323,0.94,1694159407.0,"Hi guys. Just wanted to vent a bit about some of my childhood traumatic experieces.
When I was a child my parents had been having sex next to me in the same bed. My first memories are from around when I was 5 years old. They were doing it thinking I was asleep but I was too scared to tell them I am not and that I see and understand everything. I started then to make some noises during their sex so they could feel uncomfortable and they stopped doing it since I was about 7 because they moved me into my own room.
The thing is that it made me sexual way too young. I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...
I feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.

Update: Thank you all for such a support. I feel much better after reading your comments about the fact I was just a child and is not my fault I wasn't taught about sex and what's right and what's not. I also want to mention that I am a female and already an adult, it was more than 20 years ago but I kept this within myself for a long time because of shame and guilt I felt.

I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,313,0.98,1685151418.0,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

She showed me them and they are superficial and don’t need immediate medical attention.

I tried to remain calm and just not overreact or panic. I let her know that I’m sorry she was feeling so strongly that she resorted to hurting herself and I let her know that I don’t think badly of her and I want to help her.

She agreed that she would like to get help so we are going to get a referral from her doctor for a therapist on Wednesday.

She said she does it to relieve stress and when she’s feeling upset but that it isn’t a suicide attempt. I let her know that we need to find another way for her to release stress since this is dangerous.
I took her with me to work and school today so we could spend some extra time together. 

I’m not sure what else I can do. I’m trying to keep it together but I do feel terrible that she is feeling so low. I wish I could take all her pain away.

Edit: *Update*
Thanks for all the support! Even though I tried my hardest to do what was best it still felt like I wasn’t doing enough so it was very reassuring reading through everyone’s comments and experiences. 

We got a referral from her pediatrician so now we are waiting for therapy. In the mean time we have been doing more activities together and she has been a lot more open to trying stuff. 

Yesterday was rough because I spent some one-on-one time with my son (9) and she felt a little betrayed after we were spending so much time together. At first she didn’t want to talk to me but eventually she came around and I told her it’s normal to feel that way and she’s still important even if I spend time with her brother. 

My son has ADHD (and possibly autism, we are in the process of getting an evaluation) so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside. It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn’t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don’t allow children under 15. 

She even stopped wearing her jacket which I felt like was huge so I think we are making good progress.

What the fuck did my older brother just do?,306,0.95,1711828799.0,"Hello. I'll post this because I am really... utterly disgusted and in disbelief of what just happened. I might delete this later or whatever, I don't use reddit that much.

For context, I'm F18. I left our home at the age of 17 to enter a state university miles long away from our home. It takes me months to return home and I came back for a week long vacation (for long holidays) last Monday. Since I will be returning back to the city I'm currently studying in tomorrow, I wanted to at least bond and catch up with my older brothers since I've been away for months. We weren't that close, but I understood them more now since I've accepted to just let things be (again for context, my older brother stopped in college and currently out of school youth).

I was with them (my siblings' room), we were having fun, my 2nd older brother [M21] was in the lower bunk bed and me and my oldest brother [M22] was together in the top bunk. We were laughing and all, playing games, then my brother hugged me while I was playing games in his phone while we were also chatting. It looked sweet to me because we were not really touchy, he's introverted, and I innocently thought that we're getting closer. While having fun chatting and all, he kept on caressing my stomach and asked where's my navel at, and he touched, caressed it so much that I felt gross and laughingly told him not to touch it while still playing the game. 

He then on proceeded to fucking ask ""where should I touch you then"" and unhesitatingly put his fucking disgusting hands on my chest LIKE IT WAS FUCKING NOTHING and whispered ""here? can I touch you here? please let me"" LIKE A FUCKING UNEDUCATED CREEP. I was so grossed out and can't think properly at the moment so I chose laugh it off and got out of their room saying I'm sleepy already and needed to rest since I still have a long travel for tomorrow.

It was so, so fucking creepy since I didn't expect my brother to be like that. In context, my 2nd older brother is just the same. He also did something like that when I was a minor. And I was raped when I was in preschool. I know nothing at that age, but I remember it until now. I allowed that person to do it because I know nothing... I really don't know nothing. I was so vulnerable. I was just a child. When my parents asked why my medical results says that there was blood in my vagina and all, I was so nervous, scared, and got angry at them. I didn't understand it, but in my mind I was so scared if they knew (it's like having sex and telling your parents you had sex at that age). Looking back, it was so gross and I just wanna cry. I don't want to elaborate it further about what happened afterwards. I tried to forget... even until now.

Please... please help. I've been through a lot. Not just this but things way worse than an 18-year-old should experience. Please help me😭 what should I do it felt so fucking, fucking gross like it won't ever fade away even if I scrub all over my body and bath again and again. I feel so dirty. I am so fucking mad right now. I was reminded with everything. Am I still supposed to understand, knowing that these guys know no shit? I AM SO MAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I WANT TO CUT MY WR1ST AGAIN FOR DISTRACTION I CANT WITH THIS FUCKED UP LIFE IT'S HOLY WEEK FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS😭

TW: What they don't tell you about hanging yourself,295,0.99,1699207870.0,"A much needed premise: I miraculously survived hanging myself back in February of this year.

It was not the first time I attempted unaliving myself but it was the first time I was actually going to be successful if things hadn't turned out the way the did.

I had done my research about this. I could not fathom doing it any other ways that I thought were ""too painful and gory"", either for me or for the person who would find me.

So, after that, I was hospitalized for a month and a half and they changed my meds after 3 years and I have to say I am now in a much better mental state and ready to talk about this.

If you ever thought about doing this you may have a picture in your head of how it's going to go. I had it too and it couldn't be further from the truth of what happened.

So here's the reality check:

Firsts things first, it is not ""painless"" at all, it is not ""slowly drifting to sleep"". Your body will get SO MAD that you are doing this and it will react in the worst and most painful ways possible.

To start, you won't have control over your limbs. I remember seeing my arms in front of me with the hands all tensed up like a zombie. It felt like my tendons were slowly getting shorter and shorter and I couldn't move them. I always thought when the survival instinct would kick in the arms would go up to the rope in an attempt to lift yourself up. And it's true that your brain will think that, but trust me, you will have NO CONTROL over your movements. You want to lift the arms up overhead and they just slap around aimlessly.

Then you will feel like your head is going to explode and your eyes are going to pop out. I felt my whole face go warmer and warmer and starting to tingle like crazy.

And that's not even the worst part: it was the lungs for me. You see, your body will get to a state of primal survival instinct where it will do anything it can to just catch a breath. But since the airways are blocked, your whole torso will tense in and out with so much force that your lungs and stomach hurt like hell. Think of a worm curling up when you touch it. Your body will do the same over and over, in and out, each movement more and more painful than the previous one. And it's not like you can control it. You can't. My whole abs and back muscles hurt as if I had fallen from 3 stories for like 2 weeks afterwards just from the effort my body was making by trying to get some oxygen.

I won't even go into how it ends because it's just fucking scary. I'll just say that there's a point where you have the lucid thought of ""I am dying, and there's nothing I can do about it"". And it's the most terrifying yet real feeling ever. It's not ""calm and peaceful"" like you make it out to be in your mind before doing it. It's sheer panic. And when you have this thought it's like it lasts a millisecond but you're now stuck in this state that doesn't leave you.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I feel like some people need to hear this. I certainly would have had second thoughts had I known it in advance.

I won't go into how I survived because I honestly still feel guilty and embarrassed about it. Just know I had to be resuscitated twice and can't remember a thing after that panic feeling. That would have been the last feeling I ever felt. Not peace, not relief.

I am now convinced there's absolutely no ""painless"" way to go and I'm scared as hell for when it will be my time to go in the future. I still have these feelings sometimes, to end it all but I have to admit I am now an official coward.

So yeah, would not recommend. It was NOT worth it. Just delay that feeling for as long as possible, trust me.",mentalhealth,None,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/17ohtpv/tw_what_they_dont_tell_you_about_hanging_yourself/,27,297.979797979798,2.9797979797979792,0.0006396324182101485

We went to the doctor. Then the hospital (I was flabbergasted they didn’t admit him). Last night it all went to hell. He got hyper fixated on my son.

   I was shocked and asked him what is he talking about. I have zero interest in him and I was happy about the theraphy process. Now it has been 2 days since, I’m seeing nightmares my therapist is raping me. I’m so confused- sad- angry. What should I do?

Please Stop Recommending Pets as a Mental Health Fix,283,0.96,1696445562.0,"I’ve seen this several times under a lot of posts on this Reddit, and I’m not saying pets don’t help. I don’t want to discount the experiences of people who says pets have helped with their mental illnesses, and I don’t want to discredit scientific studies that suggest having a pet elevates your mood.  However, a pet is a living creature that requires a lot of care, and if you are so depressed it is hard to keep up with your responsibilities, a pet might add to your stress rather than helping relieving it. This really reminds me of those couples who fight and fight and they think having a baby will fix their relationship. 

Please remember that pets aren’t props used to help humans, they are living creatures with their own feelings and needs. I don’t want to discourage you from getting a pet, but please only get one if you can take care of it, not just to help with your mental health.

My friend says he’ll never forgive me because I called the authorities for a welfare check after he told me he was contemplating suicide,286,0.95,1682257578.0,"

This morning, one of my best friends called me and was in tears. He spoke about frustration and suicidal ideation. As someone who suffers bipolar disorder, I completely  understood his pain and where he was coming from. I tried to calm him down but then he hung up on me. The last thing he said was “I’m really sorry. You won’t hear from me again very soon. Thank you for everything”
And then for thirty minutes, I tried to reach out to him but I couldn’t. I travelled out of the state for the weekend and I’m 3 hours away. He stays alone and I don’t know any of his neighbors so I was forced to ask the authorities to go to his house for a welfare check. 
They did and determined he was fine. He then called me and said he would never speak to me again or forgive me for doing that. But I couldn’t live with myself leaving him alone after talking about killing himself. I feel horrible like I betrayed his trust but another part of me feels like I did the right thing and maybe potentially saved his life.

There was a period of about a month when when he was drunk he would come up in the middle of the night and force himself on my mum , he is already a control freak so me and my brother can’t close our doors and he would keep theirs open too even though out rooms are next door. Basically every other night I would hear this and it would give me breakdowns every time crying panicking and not knowing what to do with myself. For some time I tried to intervene cause I felt horrible for not doing anything which just made it 10x worse and ended up with him threatening to kill me if I ever did it again and our already bad relationship being worse. I tried to talk to my mum she did admit sometimes she didn’t want to (I have physically heard him push her down and her saying no) but she gave me the sex is good talk and told me to leave it and stop intervening.

Shortly after, me and my ex broke up and he decided to stay and help her. She struggles a bunch mentally and really needs someone to stay with her so I didn't find this to be a bad idea.
They eventually started to get super close and I started asking them if they ever might get together. I was wanting to be prepared in case they ever did. My ex claimed that she's not gonna say no and doesn't want him out of her life if he brings her happiness. Yesterday, we were talking more about it and it pretty much came up that they have slept together.


What really hurts is that me and her had a unhealthy relationship and that we hadn't had sex in over year due to what we thought was her mental problems. Due to this and some other factors, I started acting distant in the relationship and she believes that was holding her back from wanting to be physical with me for the last year.


When I found out they have slept together it sent me into a huge panic attach basically running and crying into the woods. Right now I keep picturing them sleeping in the same bed that me and her used to sleep in and it creates the absolute worst feelings I've ever experienced.

Be honest: How often do you think about su*c*de?,256,0.96,1711308389.0,"I know this is a sensitive topic and I am even afraid to talk about it with my therapist

I honestly have no idea if it is normal to think about su\*cide as often as I do. Like not really attempting it, not even being close to doing it. Just thinking about it.

Since forever planning my su\*cide in depth somehow calmed me. Whenever I feel stressed or anxious I think of different ways how to do it and somehow this is the only thing that calms me. Most of the time I think daily about it, on the way to work, when doing housework etc

Your therapist really does care about you. 

Every time we see you accomplish something or overcome something, we are filled with pride. 

Every time you share your pain with us, we always take a little bit of that home with us. 

We think about you outside of sessions. 

Sometimes we worry ourselves to the point of losing sleep over you. 

You don’t “annoy” us. 

Every time you share a trauma that’s hard for you to talk about, we feel honored.

Sex is disgusting sometimes- I think I might know why?,234,0.92,1712155817.0,"I lived with my dad for a little period of time and did always go to his cottage whenever I was off school. One thing was- he would always fuck his girlfriend/wife at the time very loudly. At some point I started getting really annoyed by it because I would storm out of the house screaming “STOP having sex when I’m here”. It kept happening. I was glad it happened in a different room but you don’t understand how SMALL this cottage was. I could hear everything and that girl would do it on purpose so I could hear it.  They would do it in their room and do it in the bathroom. It echoed so much. 

It was always the have loud vigorous sex, come out of the room with such confidence and going to the kitchen table to have a cigarette and a coffee. That’s the pattern. Daily. Constantly.

I knew she did it on purpose because my relationship was always terrible with the girl. She was jealous of a young girl because my dad loved me. I was jealous of her because I knew she didn’t deserve my dad and that she was pushing him away from me.

I think it got to a rotten point where I got myself off on it because I was so used to it happening every night. I think this part is what is getting me... I was only 11/12-13 at the time doing all of this. It only continued from there until I moved out. There was nothing I could do but wait on the couch and sleep there until it was over. I didn’t realize how fucked up it was to do what I was doing. But truly -because I was so exposed that -I thought it was normal to do so. I think it’s affected me even now just because of what they did- and what I’ve done while that was all happening. I feel cursed. Disgusting. Confused. Vile. Sad. Desensitized. Not normal.

I continue to think about it Til this day, and it grosses me out and sometimes it will pop up in really awkward moments. I feel a rise of anger when I hear any form of moaning or sighing- I get scared or weirded or grossed out while trying to have sex. I will have flashbacks when having sex. I get fear from it sometimes. I hate to be touched sometimes- and it has a lot to do with this.

-I’ve also been through some weird instances where my dad would slap my ass “as a joke”. Who does that all the way up til they’re 13?
- I used to be laying on the couch and I swear to god at some point he was watching porn around me. He was doing it in the kitchen at the table. I know this because I heard the moaning and at the time there was only me and him around the cottage 


-stumbled onto my dads only laptop and found a bunch of legging porn videos.. also stumbled onto his only camera and found nudes of his gf. I’m finding all of this at the age of 11-13 years old.

-edit: my dad and the girlfriend left me alone a lot with the girlfriends son and daughter at the time. The daughter same age as me and the son 16. At the time I was 13. we were in my dad’s girlfriend’s cottage. The son had a few drinks and he started to give me a small amount of attention and sleazily asked me to be his girlfriend that night. Later on he pressures me into giving him a BJ and I do it because I want a boyfriend - and the morning after he breaks up with me. Stone cold. I actually thought we were gonna be together but he actually just used me- then becomes my step brother  a few years after. I think I got really lucky for being the heavier/ fat girl at the time because it would take a lot more for him to take MORE advantage of me than he already did. It was my FIRST memorable sexual experience that was NOT good. He kicked me out of the room right after he couldn’t nut.

I also have a faint memory of being around the age of 5 and playing with a younger boy and we were in a closet stripping. Thankfully we got caught. I asked my mom and my sister if that ever happened because clearly the other mom probably would make a scene out of it knowing what just happened - but they both said they don’t recollect this at all. I think I’m going insane with this guilt of being so young but also pushing myself onto another person that way.

It just gets really fucked up. Also people think this is a LARP.. which is really really sad. Because this legit has happened. What am I lying about for. I smoke weed daily just to not cry- I have self harm scars from when I was ten just from crying for ANY form of attention. I have physical and mental regrets throughout everything I’ve been through.

I finally got a therapist that’s good at her job and now I am livid.,205,0.99,1688760333.0,"Alright, I got a story for y’all. 

I had an eye opening therapy session yesterday, and I just wanna share about how I never realized things that happen to us as a child can have such lasting subconscious impacts on us for the rest of our lives. 

Ima bout to get real with y’all, and share an experience that happened to me. 

This is something I have a suppressed memory about it, and because of the way adults have portrayed it to me growing up, I always told it as a haha funny story. These fvckers spoke about it as if it were a joke and now I’m angry.

Something about me, is if I ever feel as though I’m in trouble I shut down. I go non verbal, and it’s hard to come out of. Therapist asked about it, and when I first felt that as a child. I first said something about being put in the corner as a child and if i talked I had to stay longer. But then it hit me. 

As a child, I had pretty bad adhd (still do) and would never stop talking. Got on a lot of people’s nerves. So, one night a relative was babysitting me. I was younger than 5. (Likely around 3/4) I wouldn’t stop talking and bothering her. 

So what does this relative do? Duck tapes my hands and feet to a bed and put tape over my mouth, and left me in a room until my mom came back to get me. 

My mom was livid. Unfortunately she’s passed since so I can’t ask her about it. 

After that, adults, my father included would ride around with duck tape on the dash of their cars and threaten me with it if I misbehaved. 

Every time that story was brought up by the people in my life, it was told as a funny story, so that became my association with it. To this day, it’s brought up as a funny memory. 

I just never made the connection before about it. 

But now, having my own kids and thinking about someone doing that to my toddler, nah I’d be in jail right now. 

That’s not even the worst of what’s happened to me as a child, but now I just want to call my father and tell him with as much disrespect as I can give, Fvck you.

I found my mother dead yesterday,201,0.99,1690183434.0,"I (21F) found my mother (56F) passed away yesterday morning outside in her chair. She was suffering from terminal lung cancer and was in horrible daily pain. She had gotten her diagnosis just a few months ago, and although it was terminal my family wasn’t expecting her to go so soon. We really thought we’d have a lot more time with her. We actually had a cookout planned that day so the family could come over and spend time with her. I can’t get the image of her slumped over in her chair out of my head. Seeing her pale face and my heart just stopping. Trying to wake her up even though I knew she was gone. I feel so numb and I don’t understand why. I feel like I should be crying more but I just can’t anymore. Nothing feels real. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. It doesn’t feel fair. I feel like I’ve been robbed. I have so much anger I don’t know where to direct. My mother didn’t deserve to die so early nor should anyone have to lose their parent so young. These past few months leading up to this I’ve been in a depressed haze, cutting off friends and isolating myself. I was starting to feel the loneliest I’d ever felt in my life but now I think this is it. I have nobody to talk to about this. I’m just so sad. Support or advice would be appreciated.

UPDATE: I don’t use Reddit much so I’m not sure if everyone who replied will get notifications for this: 

I just wanted to post a update and thank everyone who has taken their time to comment and reach out .  you guys have no idea how much all this support has meant to me. These past few hours have been extremely rough. I’m not going to lie, I’m still a bit numb. I just can’t believe my mother, the women I’ve known my entire life is gone. I will never see her again. It shatters my heart all over again every time I’m reminded. My mother was the most caring and beautiful women I’ve even known. The morning she passed, she woke me up very early at 2am asking if I was okay. This was very unlike her. I’d like to think in some way she knew what was coming and wanted to spend some time with me before she left. My best friend and I recently reconnected right before my moms passing, they have been keeping me company which has been really helpful. Surprisingly I’ve been laughing a lot these last 2 days more than crying. I think my mom would have wanted that for me. Although I’m still incredibly lonely and depressed about her passing, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. As my mother is no longer suffering in pain, she’s completely at peace now and where she always wanted: in the afterlife with my grandparents ❤️ 
Again thank you to all the amazing wonderful people who took their time to leave me heartwarming advice and share their experiences. I was losing hope in humanity for the longest time but posting my experience here  has brought me nothing but peace and encouragement. You all are the most wonderful people imaginable and I can’t thank you enough. I really didn’t expect so many people to see this.

My psychologist told me something I wish my parents had told me,190,0.99,1685537057.0,"I'm 36(m), and I went to my first ever therapy session ever. I've been battling depression, anxiety, and stress for almost my whole life. I have my good days and bad days, and it has been a terrible 6 months.

I knew I had dyslexia and showed signs of ADHD, and it has been left untreated since childhood, and now it is affecting me even with the simplest of tasks. 

She said that I have a thinksy mind that overthinks and over exaggerates simple things. She went on explaining it all and trying to help me rewire my thinking. 

Then she said something I didn't expect, she said it was not my fault that I could learn those topics in school, it wasn't my fault that I could not understand those math equations.

Wife is going through breakdown and told me she wants to divorce,190,0.98,1694973549.0,"My wife of almost 15 years (we have been together for 21) decided she wanted to divorce me suddenly before a work trip. She knew I was going alone and would be isolated. 

I spent the first few days in a hotel room in a strange country in complete shock. All the emotions ran through my head. I blamed myself, every little comment said. 

A few years ago she suffered from an incredibly paranoid phase (thanks a lot pandemic) where she thought the neighbours were spying on her and everyone was out to get her. I work away a lot so I'd come home to find her in this state. The ""cameras"" always ended up being garden lights or motion activated lamps, but when I pointed this out (after 6 months not so tactfully) she seemed to withdraw from me. 

After that we had a yoyoing relationship, where she would tell me one moment she loves me, the next a divorce. We always sorted it out because I love her and want to support her and the kids unconditionally. 

I noticed her withdrawing. She would be in the same room with me, but not in spirit. She would explode at me in anger for the smallest things, and the big things she wouldn't seem to care about. 

She decided to go on medication, which helped. Although she became more of a robot and lost all interest in any form of intimacy. It broke my heart. 

She came off of them about a year ago and things started to improve. We became physical (although at the worst of times she would have sex with me and throw it in my face on the next angry outburst, calling it rape etc. I never forced her into sex at all, but did complain we weren't intimate many times). 

So, this latest situation was only three days ago. I'm still in a hotel halfway across the world, but my father rang me this morning. 

Apparently she stayed at a female friend of ours house last night because she thought the neighbours were spying on her. She told me that she is hated in the area and that she will be sent back to her home country (she has been living in the UK for over 20 years and is from Europe) and the kids taken away. She strongly believes it to be true. 

My father picked her and the kids up and she adamantly wanted to report everything to the police regarding it. The police obviously didn't take it seriously. Our neighbours are all 80'ish years old and not malicious. A pain, but not malicious. 

So as I sat here, pulling the threads on everything bad I'd done (because she will often use anything I've done wrong as ammo) when I get a call saying a mental health nurse is visiting her. She's at my Dad's with the kids. 

I love her with all my heart. She's a fantastic mother and person. But she will just torture me over and over and I stay because of this love. I worry about the kids and how she'll cope. It breaks my heart. 

So I just carry on working, supporting her and trying to build our family. I've turned into a persuer it seems, trying to hold us all together. Always initiating conversations. Trying to understand her feelings. She wouldn't make the effort to talk first. 

Did she really mean she wanted a divorce? Or is this just symptoms of her MH? I can't leave her when she needs me, and although this is effecting me I can take it. I want her to be safe and feel better but she's breaking me down with the constant swings in feelings towards me.  She is an amazing person at her best, but at her worst it's like Jekyll and Hyde. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so what was the outcome?

*Edit*

I was arrested straight off the plane. They aarested me on suspicion of Rape and coercion.  I was taken straight to the police station and was just released pending investigations.

I've picked my car up, but I'm not allowed to contact her, go to the house without police escort, go to her place of work (which I wouldn't) go to the school. Where my kids attend or ask anyone to talk to her for me.

I've never raped her. She thinks having sex because she felt guilty whilst not objecting is rape because she didn't really want it. She's saying this happened multiple times. I'm feeling broken

Looking at the past history, I think she has BPD. The re-writing of the past, the annoyances at very minor things. Disassociation and acting.

My birthday is this next coming Saturday and my mom or dad will want to go out to eat for my birthday but I honestly just want to disappear this time and go to a hotel or just stay home and not do anything but then I know my family will get upset.

Sexual encounter has left me utterly broken,169,0.93,1698153580.0,"TW: SA/Infidelity

Long story short, I (25M) blacked out at a party and when I came to I was naked, had thrown up. I had sex with someone. I remember some bits: 

Saying I needed to go.

Asking to stop and offering oral sex instead. I think I said “If I go down instead, can we stop?”

Worried I’m a pedophile,173,0.86,1700547978.0,"
19M

I wonder if I even AM worried at all. Lately I’ve been feeling apathetic towards my mental issues/habits. Hell, I don’t even feel annoyed/bothered by the things that usually annoy/bother me. The worry feels fake, I think. Then again, my “self-aware” thoughts tend to feel fake.

But anyways, I met this person on Discord and we both produce music. I showed them my music, they showed me theirs. They were fun to talk to, and it felt completely platonic. They asked me if I was an adult, and I said I was 19. They said they were fifteen. I don’t know if they’re male or female, but something hints at them being female.

Now, I don’t remember feeling any attraction to this right away, no, I don’t think I did. But I think my mind wants to convince me and say “what if you did feel attracted? Maybe you don’t remember.” 

I never fantasized/thought about them sexually or anything, ever. I don’t like to say it, but I did kind of feel a bit attracted, not even sexually. Of course, my mind doubts that and makes me wonder if I do/did feel attracted sexually. But I did daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually)?

The attraction felt more like a romantic one, not sexual. Still, that should bring concern, but I don’t feel concerned. I don’t even feel concerned that I don’t feel concerned. It seems like my mind keeps getting more and more messed up.

————————————————————————

It doesn’t stop here. I sometimes catch myself “looking” at much younger girls, and daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually, more like attracted to my face and just my face), but this hasn’t happened in a long time. I sometimes avoid looking at them this way, and keep my eyes away and instead focus on their face (which doesn’t make me feel attraction, but of course I doubt this).

”Daydreams/fantasies” on my OWN never feature any underage people. 

And of course, I feel apathetic. But, I do think this whole issue is gonna make it a bit more difficult for me to enjoy things.  I wondered if I’d be able to enjoy dancing anymore, because “yeah that guy dances well, but he’s a pedo, so…”

If it’s any help, I’ve never used underage characters (like lolis for example) in things like AI chats, only actual adult characters. I’ve never used porn like jailbait porn or “barely legal” or anything like that.

And I am attracted to people my age. I just wrote “too,” but deleted it, and I think that means something.

I also always have the wrong reactions/opinions, like when people say pedophilia isn’t a sexuality, I feel opposed.

Edit: Nearly everyone here has told me it sounds like POCD, but I feel like it’s more than that. I can’t deny that I did daydream of little girls being romantically attracted, I can’t deny the attraction to that fifteen year old.

I told the fifteen year old that I couldn’t talk anymore. I then unfriended them. I felt something when I saw their profile, it was only romantic but mild, I think. Mild or not, it was romantic. It quickly went away once I no longer saw their profile, but still, it was there.

I had a child loss. And I am okay.,167,0.97,1702414318.0,"Hi, about ten months ago (Feb) I had a miscarriage. I saw my dead baby. Yes, it wasn’t just a pile of cells. I’m pro choice, so whatever you would like to call it for yourself, then go right ahead, anyways. 

I’ve been struggling a lot. I loved them so much even though I didn’t know them well. I knew how they made me feel, and what they were doing to my body. I knew I was excited and loved them with my whole heart and body already. 

It took many months after my loss to finally name them. I never got the chance to know them well, so naming was hard. I decided to go with Jordyn or Jordie for short. 

The name Jordie comes from my cousin, who I love so much, and is one of my favourite people. And I love the name Jordyn, especially for a feminine person. 

I’m doing okay. I know that it’s not my fault. My baby wasn’t developing properly, and would have been born either very sick, and miserable, or passed away, like they were. 

They are at peace, and I’m coming to that point now. I miss them everyday. But I also have an amazing partner to help me through everything. 

I’m going to be okay. 
One day, I might meet them again, and who knows in what way?

No matter what, I know they wouldn’t blame me, because Jordyn was sick. 

I am still a parent. 
I am still a mother.

Edit: I identify as enby. They/them. Not a woman, but still a mama🩷🩵🩷

Edit 2: one in four pregnancies end in loss. It’s not as common to lose your baby in the second or third trimesters, but it is just as valid. I lost Jordyn in the second trimester. I was supposed to be 15 ish weeks pregnant, but when they passed away, they were only the size of a 7-8 week baby. I just felt like I wanted to share this information. 

I’m also going into grief counselling to help support myself with my journey of not being a mom anymore. There’s a quote that I really love, it goes like this:

“I carried you every second of your life, and I will miss you every second for the rest of mine.”🩵🩷🩵🩷

I also plan on having a funeral for Jordyn in the future, if I still have trouble with grieving. And that’s okay. They were loved, and still are. And even though they were sick, I still see them as perfect.

We found my grandma dead this morning and I feel like it's all my fault,167,0.99,1710564194.0,"My mom, grandma and I live together. Last night I was cooking food around 11:30pm. I swore I heard a woman for a split second. It was high pitched and startled me and I took my pan off the stove and listened intently and heard nothing. I texted my mom and asked if she was making noise . Didn't get a response and went to my studio area . Didn't fall asleep. At 4 30am my mom frantically ran to me and told me to hurry quickly. She had found my grandma in her master bathroom on the ground and needed help turning her over . I turned her on her back and she was dead. 
Blood came out her nose and mouth. Mom was on the phone with 911 . Gave her CPR . And she was just gone. She had been gone, she was cold with no pulse. Unexpected and out of nowhere.
She was fine last night. 

I feel guilty. I had the thought to check on her when I heard that noise because it had me frightened it was so strange of a sound. But I didn't want to wake her up and it was storming. There's 3 dogs in the house . I assumed it was in my head and it could of been. There was no sign she fell and hit her head or anything like that . It seemed she was probably gone when she hit the floor. But in my head and heart I keep saying what if I had went in there ... if I had maybe my grandma would be here still. I hate myself right now . This is the worst day of my life. I lost my papaw and that was bad. But this is something else... I was talking to her last night about how I'd lost weight and just chatting .

My mother hung herself in the woods yesterday.,161,0.98,1691289332.0,"This doesn't feel real and I am going through throwing up and being in denial. My mother suffered from bipolar but was pretty good at masking it around people for most of my life. I just turned 33 and as her daughter I never expected she would be out of my life forever at this age. This year has been terrible because something triggered a 10 day manic episode in January where she basically burned every bridge. Once it was over she couldn't get over the shame and fell into a deep depression. She was hospitalized multiple times but could only seem to be kind of act functional for a week or so back at home and then get so depressed again that she wouldn't eat or sleep. 

She moved in with me and I really thought I could help her but it was a cycle of her acting somewhat hopeful to a deep depression. Yesterday we got into an argument because I found out she has been lying about taking her meds. We exchanged some words and she got into her car and sped away. I really didn't think much of it and thought maybe she just needed space. After too many hours went by, my sibling and I started blowing up her phone. 

I finally filed a missing persons report while hoping she just went to a hotel or something. This morning the doorbell rang with two officers holding their hats.

I think I fucked up by being honest to my professor...,164,0.95,1691086609.0,"Basically I emailed him asking a simple question about my grade. He asked me why I took ""so long"" to email him about this, because I only saw the grades right now, but they got released two months ago.

In 2 small paragraphs and 4 sentences in total I very briefly explained to him that I got in a delirium today from my cat getting lost and spiraling into a depressive episode from being in a very stressful environment (basically my friends treating me like their therapist). I explained I have issues for which I am on my way to get properly medicated for which causes me, among other things, extreme anxiety to see my grades, and that I hadn't seen my grades in general in almost a year. Therefore, getting in a delirium and becoming deeply unstable and barely holding onto reality, I decided that that moment was the safest one for me to see my grades, because I'd get the least shock from being most detached from reality.

Of course he hasn't responded, I don't expect him to, but I'm scared I fucked up by telling the truth when the truth is... this. I find it difficult in general to lie, but especially in times when I lose control. I was even preparing to lie to him just in case he'd ask me something like this, but I knew I had nothing to back up my lie. And being upfront was kind of the only way for me to actually justify being so late in emailing, because that's just the reality.

I just want to get my degree with my own dignity... I hope I don't make these people hate me forever for being like this and thus stop me from receiving what I study so hard for...

Edit: Before I go to sleep I want to clarify 2 things. Number 1 is that I don't judge my professor at all for not responding to me, I would do the same in such fragile situation. Number 2 is that for me, none of the information I shared were things I ""hide"" from anybody casually (not in a professional setting of course if not prompted). There's a myriads of other things I hide, which are way more severe and unsettling to the average Joe. Sharing *those* things for me would be considered **for my own boundaries** as oversharing, simply because the information I shared is almost my entire life. I have nothing to say about my life if it's not that, which just covers the surface. Of course my definition of oversharing may be objectively wrong, but that's my personal definition of it. But besides the open ended conversation that is naturally unfolding, my main concern is about type of emotions this information could evoke to the other person, such as falsely making them believe I lied, making me look inappropriate to work in the industry, making me look difficult to work with, etc.",mentalhealth,the-fourth-planet,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15hbkih/i_think_i_fucked_up_by_being_honest_to_my/,41,172.63157894736844,8.631578947368439,0.000370564565283139

This initially started over quarantine because I was stuck in the same house as my family. They like to dig into your insecurities and even made me feel like I’m ugly, so I thought up a girl who doesn’t have those insecurities and was just all around beautiful and imagining what kind of life she would lead. The only one I’ll be going over in this post is “Sasha” which was a name I had liked due to being a big Bratz fan when I was younger and I had hated my name because it’s not very common and not only had an apostrophe, but also has a capital letter in the middle and was often made fun of. Since then, I have learned to love my name and switched her name to be mine. To better describe her and her life, she’s a beautiful dark skinned Afro-Latina woman who has long dark brown hair, she has an hourglass figure, and the most beautiful brown eyes in terms of looks and I often times will stay awake simply imagining her face and wanting to cry or scream. In terms of what she’s like, she has a very sweet personality, but she’s much more confident than me and takes crap from no one, she’s seen as the most perfect woman originally at school and later as an actress. She at some point got married to my dream man and they had kids who were practically the definition of perfection.

Recovering from depression is worse than depression itself,161,0.98,1682871353.0,"I have been majorly depressed for years. During that time I lost relationships, took gap years from college, isolated, missed out on opportunities, gave up on everything I was talented it, and have led a life that I am not proud of. I never wanted to be around others because I knew that I was a burden to whoever I talked to. 


Now that I have in many ways made great strides toward recovery (or at least better coping mechanisms), I almost wish I hadn’t. Depression was comforting in a way. It filled some type of void. Now I look back at almost ten years of emptiness. I feel like dying would have been better because my life is like looking back on someone who was dead. I feel like my life is completely worthless. I understand that the sentiment that comparison is the thief of joy, but looking at the lives of others my age I don’t see the point. I feel like I will never have a full life, like I’ll always be behind. I’ve tried everything.

I'm a iraqi turkmen suffering alot and don't trust iraqi propaganda or kurdish propaganda 

Iraq is a hellhole

I suffer daily as a 13 year old

Poverty is quite common

Saddam added his image to all books and he persecuted turkmens

Urban areas are full of beggars

The education here is soooo shitty we get 60-80 hard exams yearly and 30 questions per exam 5 divisions of questions 

We have to read the whole book 200 pages and barely get anything out of it to become 'smarter' out of 1000 questions we memorize we only get 3% of those how useless

My father is exploited by the iraqi government and we can't even go back to our ancestral countries 

Any iraqis who are struggling seeing this i don't deny it because iraq is in bad condition socially 

Iraq has power cuts everyday and 6 times a day

The educational ministry brainwashed all turkic people here explains why they're patriotic 

Christians here aren't that persecuted but 2 governorates najaf and karbala persecute them and teach them their propaganda 

Iraqi conquerors killed 100000 central asian turks and raped 50000 and forced them to join the army and become arabs, this is also the reason why many iraqi turkmens support the siege of baghdad 

If you're wondering why us iraqi turkmens don't seem to be related to iranian turkmens is because we're iranian azeris

My turkic brothers are any of you here for me

I often feel negativity towards iraqis


The education here is VERY manipulative it explains why kids are patriotic

If you do not raise a iraqi flag during a mawtini performance then the school will beat you

And kurds here make policies harming us using fake information and they've kurdified many turkmens in erbil and they stole jarmo from kerkuk and called it 'the oldest kurdish village' while kurds didn't exist at that time

I am an introvert have been dealing with social anxiety for the past three years. I've been through some traumatic experiences through my life.

I am 34 years old man. I have been there for people my whole life. Helping anyone in need. Emotionally supportive. Going above and beyond to help people who are at the lowest. I just want to see people happy and am willing to go to any lengths to make that happen. Never looking for any personal gain out of it....Just waiting for the universe to save me as I have been saving others.

I am forgotten. I know someone is going to bring up self worth and how I am placing it in others and seeking validation from others...but is it too much to ask. I feel I have wasted my whole life.

"""Ugliness survey"" at the hospital exacerbated my body dysmorphia",156,0.98,1697972438.0,"I'm a 30 year old woman. I've struggled with body dysmorphia since childhood, mostly fixating on my nose (which has a bump and is crooked, so there is what you might call a ""real"" issue) as well as a general sort of ugliness that I cannot specifically place.   


This past summer I was hospitalized for anorexia and once I was transferred from inpatient to outpatient, they enrolled me in a few group therapies. One of the nurses in the program had me email her photos of my face from different angles and distributed these photos to ten anonymous staff members at the hospital, and asked them to answer questions like, ""How ugly is this person out of 10?"" or ""How much does this person's nose ruin their face?"" and so on. We wrote the questions together.  


Before she did this exposure I expressed multiple times that I feared I would be at risk of self-harming upon seeing the results, and that I really did not want to do it. I asked if I could opt out and she said yes but continued to bring it up and ask me why I wouldn't do it until I eventually agreed.   


The results came in and were varied. A couple people rated me a ""10"" for beauty, others a ""4."" More than half said that my nose does in fact ruin my face (ratings of 6-10 out of 10).   


These results were very distressing to me, less because of the numbers themselves and more so because I felt coerced into doing the exposure and because there was no follow up or after care. The nurse read me the results, gave me the ""raw data"" and excused me from her office. This was in July, it's mid-October now, and I am still struggling with this information.  


This is of course not the ""cause"" of my dysmorphia, but I'm feeling unable to get past what feels like confirmation of my ugliness. I have trouble leaving my apartment or working while my partner is home because I fear he will look at me and see how ugly I am. It is disrupting my every day. I am in therapy with a general counsellor and also a trauma therapist, so two sessions a week, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the BDD. I also research it and read studies and articles about the disorder to try to better understand it. I consider myself in most ways a very reasonable, giving, dedicated person, friend, and partner, but I am so totally fixated on my ugliness sometimes that I fear I will drive others away.  


I guess I am asking two things: 1. Is there any hope for dysmorphic patients? I haven't felt like I've made any progress over the 12 or so years of therapy, and 2. Is this kind of exposure experiment normal?  


Thanks very much in advance for any insight.

I work in a mental health field where part of my job is referring clients to therapy and helping coordinate their care.

Like I made them promises that this would be a helpful thing and then sent them somewhere that did more harm than good. 

I know there are great therapists (I've gone to one), but I've had personal experience with bad therapists too. It's a really harmful thing, because therapy is a very vulnerable space and is not the place where you want someone who has no idea what they're doing. And yet, there are so many providers out there that are really, truly bad at their jobs.

My dad was arrested for possessing pictures of kids,142,0.95,1707366364.0,"This is my first post on here but I need help

My dad was arrested a few years back and was found in possession of child pornography.

(Context)

My dad was a highly respected professional in the teaching field until he was arrested and charged with possession of CP. After discussions with himself, my family and the solicitor who fought his case, I have developed some understanding of the situation. Suffering from trauma in his childhood, he had been searching through dodgy forums etc. to see how these people interacted with one another, whilst simultaneously getting extremely drunk. It was obviously a stupid thing to do and I feel like I have to believe that what he is saying is true as I do want to trust him.

I think back to my childhood, going round to friends houses, seeing their parents not drinking and thinking that was strange. This was only because of the copious amounts of alcohol he would ingest of an evening, from whiskey, to vodka, to endless cans of beer. But growing up and seeing this, day in day out, made me believe that this type of consumption was normal. 

When I initially found out what happened, I had received a phone call off my dad explaining vaguely what the situation was and as soon as I put the phone down, I couldn’t stop crying and I came to the conclusion that I wanted to end my life. I had my note written and I was ready, but in the back of my mind all I could think about was how I would never see my family again - and I ended up calling Samaritans (who were amazing might I add).

Anyway, this was 3 years ago, he was given a suspended sentence and community service, and life as a family hasn’t been the same ever since. He still lives at home with my mum but whenever I go back home, there is just a feeling of constant sadness and all of the happiness that I used to feel around my family is a relic of the past. 

I suppose the question I want to ask is, how do I move on from this? Obviously I’ll always love him unconditionally, but everyday I just feel more and more resentment towards him for the situation he put us all in - losing contact with countless friends and family members, having to prevent him from meeting any of his grandkids, all the looks and comments you get, and I could go on all day.

I don’t want to cast him out but it feels like I’m constantly grieving my dad, fuck, sometimes I think it might’ve made things easier if I was actually grieving him.

I broke up with my ex more then a year ago, during our relationship I hit her various times and I can’t remember how many times nor the details. After our breakup while talking she panicked, I asked her to leave my house and after she didn’t, I hit her and kicked her on the ground, this is the only episode I can fully remember and it terrifies me. 
Nothing similar happened during my previous relationships and I’m not a misogynist or anything of the kind, my friends respect me and when I tried to talk about this they made up excuses and told me she was lying because of her mental health issues. She went to the police and they didn’t believe her, I never said a word to deny it, and I told her I would not fight it if she had reported me, I would have told the truth.
I left the city since then and live hundreds of miles away, I’m trying to rebuild for myself a stable and decent life but this memories haunt me. I can’t spend one single day where I don’t have vivid memories about me being physically abusive and I really have no clue how to move on in my life being this piece of shit.

Boyfriend wants to break up with me if I don’t give him enough sex and now I don’t know what to do,127,0.87,1709225166.0," THIS POST HAS MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

Going through a very rough time right now. I’m suffering from major anxiety and panic.

My boyfriend of 3 years has lost his patience I guess and is basically breaking up with me if I can’t provide him with enough sex. (We’re both in our 20’s looking to live together soon)

I was a victim of sexual assault/abuse as a teen and he knew this from the beginning of our relationship. We’ve always had issues with sex but some months are better and some are just kinda dry. 
He told me a week ago that he can’t sit around and wait til I get better and start controlling my sexuality anymore and I need to give him more intimacy and sex. 

I’m incredibly hurt. I’ve given him alternatives that don’t include me and I would even be open if he would satisfy his needs elsewhere. 
I really want to stay with him because I love him but my only way to save this relationship is to force myself into giving him more sex. We do it every one-two months or so. 

Is that really not enough? What am I doing wrong. My libido is extremely low and I have a lot of stress all the time. I’ve been trying to work on it for ages buying different sex toys and trying to get rid of my physical pain during sex too. 

I really thought he loved me for me and that he wouldn’t just leave me for a lack of intimacy… he’s not giving me more time unless I basically promise him I will get better and we will do it more often soon. I feel not enough. I feel unsafe and I feel let down. Will I ever be enough for him?

A couple days ago I got hit with a very tough situation which you can read about on my page in r/texts. The important think to know is that I had a lapse after so long and I was contemplating suicide. I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t know who to talk to so I made the post on Reddit.

Little do I know it blows up. Hundreds of people reassuring me of the situation, over 40 reaching out in private messages, giving me genuine advice and the reality of the situation. It eased my mind and dried my tears. I was in a really bad place and I can thankfully say that Reddit has very possibly saved my life because it could have ended very badly.

There was also a lot of insults in those comments, a lot of people being harsh, but the good outweighed the bad and I didn’t care.

More like they failed at the bare minimum they were supposed to do as parents. They did their worst, not best..

We don't even treat children, victims of those parents, with the same respect as animals.

She got pregnant in feb/march 2023. It was un planned and we decided to keep the baby. I also moved in with her in May. I loved her, I wanted to marry her,start a family together, and spend the rest of my life with her .

I found out a little after I moved in that she was sleeping with this guy while we were dating. We weren’t official but we both made it clear to not be sleeping or talking to other people.

My ex’s sexlife makes me sick,128,0.78,1692037206.0,"I was in a relationship with my ex for 1 1/2 years, at the beginning of the relationship she told me about her sexual experiences which were 2. The one was a cop with an extreme superiority complex. He wasn’t asking her for permission slapped her hard, had sex too hard. She didn’t know what she was doing and just let it happen. 
Our sex life had problems because of her past experience, but after a while she enjoyed it a lot. You could say I opened her the wonders of the sex world. But during our relationship, the thought of that cop experience always stuck with me an made me sick. I get very frustrated and angry when I think about it and start too feel like I need to throw up.
Now that our relationship is over for about 3 months, i get even more sick by the thought of it.
I’m scared that she will go back for him just to have sex. I just hope it doesn’t happen.
Is this feeling I’m getting normal? Should I visit a therapist about it?

Thanks in advance!

I’m in a really dark place after the breakup and thought I can post here something, because I have no one to talk too.
My only real friend was my ex :(


Edit:
Thanks for all the support, but I owe some of you an more detailed explanation of the phrase “wonders of the sex life”. Yes I see it seems sketchy to say that. What I meant, was that she never experienced a partner who cared for her well being while having sex. Like taking it slow and listing to her body. She never had orgasms in the instances before or a sense of pleasure. 
And for all the people saying that she had different kinks and all that stuff. Later on we had our spicy adventures.

I still grieve, yes, but I sensed that everything gets Easier on me

This world has no magic and it's unacceptable.,123,0.93,1710858294.0,"When I was young I found the cheap looking, plastic tiara and rod which advertised as it is for 'enchanted fairy, at discount store, and naive thought was going on. One day I read a novel about a family that can bring the force to shield evil magicians, hidden in remote place of mountainside. I was very into said book with scripture so I actually tried the babbles in the room for over hour while holding my breath, drew my whole force and willpower to do the 'chant and fantastically resulted nothing. Later I got the said fancy rod at mall and read the instruction, was so happy to summon a small friend with it But I realized there's no battery at home. And quickly realized that I have no money at pocket. Even worse it doesn't seem to make me a cute magic familiar.

""How this world is livable without magic..?

""So this was lie, ok but how about that one?

My brain was looking for other option after this big disappointment, and this kind of disappoints, drowned me into deep sadness. It was just lie. The world is lying to me.

As writing this post as adult, still I think it's better to disappear from this world and reborn in fairyland instead. This way of start is just terrible and destined to cause mental illness, all isn't enchanted and I can't do no magic. This cold fact is absolutely drowning me in tear, no life can be reverted from death and I'm hopeless after that, while I'm slowly dying inside of short lived cage, ultimately lose all those cryptic memoires.

"I'm 16 and my life is already falling apart, all because of me. I'm too weak for this world.",126,0.94,1702368458.0,"I (16F) am complete scum. At this point, the only reason society wouldn't discard me is my age and perhaps gender. I imagine that if an older male shared my lifestyle and beliefs, he'd immediately be regarded as a loser/bottom of the barrel. You know what I'm talking about. The guy who lives in his mom's basement, unemployed and loveless.

I'm self-centered and selfish, hateful towards myself, yet not enough to change anything. I have no drive or self-discipline to do anything, I go along with whatever can make me forget my reality. My escapism techniques include, but not limited to: binge eating, maladaptive daydreaming, compulsive masturbation, using character AI, obsessing over media (hyperfixations, as I'm autistic too). I spend my days bedrotting.

I'm extremely paranoid, to the point of delusions, at least according to others. I fear that my family is spying on me/my devices. Which is a major source of constant anxiety, considering the kind of stuff I do. The only friend I had is just like me, with the exception that he was capable enough to get himself out of the hole I'm in. Secretly, I began hating him for it due to my jealousy. Our friendship was just him dragging me around while I complain. I'm glad he stopped contacting me - it's less humiliating that way.

And by reading this, you might get the impression I'm someone who had a difficult life. Not really. I used to be one of those 'gifted kids' that learned to read faster than everyone else, got praised, etc, etc. I was used to having everything handed to me on a silver platter, giving up immediately if things didn't go my way. I'm not self-sufficient, I learned how to do my laundry last week.

Every once in a while, I'll make an empty promise to improve. My addictions are a glaring issue but whenever I try to stop, I get reminded of how miserable I really am. I face reality and I can't handle it. I feel furious, anxious,  to the point of having panic attacks. Which leads me back into my vices again. It goes like this - 1. Spend a week bedrotting and indulging in my addictions.

2. What the fuck am I doing with myself? I could be doing something productive.

3. Make the smallest attempt at being present in my life, at fixing something, at existing.

4. ""Everyone's better than you, you're stupid, undisciplined, ungrateful, incapable, friendless, ugly, fat, etc. Why even try?""

5. \*cue breakdown\*

6. Rinse and repeat

I have a classmate who often tries to reach out to me, which I don't understand. She's hardworking, friendly, ambitious, an overall bright person. The complete opposite of me. I politely turn her down, because she doesn't know what she's messing with. I don't want to drag her down.

So instead of just scolding my sister she parked in the store
parking lot across from her school- locked the doors and proceeded to beat the living shit out of her raking her forearms punching her face ripping chunks of her hair out…..all while her friend is in the back seat screaming…. she did so much damage in less than 2-3 mins the friend said- and then my mom just drove the 20-30secs to the school and dropped off my sister- told her go to class before you’re late- so of course an 11yr old walking into a school blood dripping from her arms patches of hair missing a swollen face drew some attention-Cps was called and we had bi weekly home visits
for 6 months-when my dad got home he was like”WTF vickie what did you do, my
god look what you did to our daughter” and my mom defiantly said “that little brat deserved it she was being disrespectful, and then proceeded to tell us how rude and disrespectful my sister was and how she deserved it” no empathy or apology-
then 6months later it morphed into self protection and minimizing what actually happened- 2 years later it morphed into something completely unrecognizable of the truth “Your sister was trying to yank the steering wheel into oncoming traffic i had to defend myself while fighting her off “

My sister is in vacation in our mother country and calls me telling me mom told
her a story about how dad would hit me and hit her-10000% false that man never laid a finger on any of us-the only thing he could be faulted with was not believing us and not divorcing her faster.He is the definition of a great loving father- everything she’s not. I fucked up and let the beans spill about how not only
did dad never hit us but mom sexually abused me -i’d wake up in the middle
of the night with her rubbing my feet the rubbing my thighs and i blanked out the rest- she would walk in on me showering -
pull the curtain open and then tell me
how the size of my peen compared to my dads…..about how the time mom made me file a false police report against our father saying he hit her or else i wouldn’t get to escape from her and spend a 4 day weekend at my friends(my dad was in oil&gas industry- being a 14yr old kid getting hit for flinching around her - i took every opportunity i could to escape from her- so i went along with her filed a false
police report and my mom almost got my dad fired from his prestigious job- the real reason was $- my dad had limited her access to their $ and she was pissed about it - wanted to get back at him. So i fucked up spilled the beans to my sister and now she’s so angry she wants to make my mom go to the police and file reports whenever she gets back from vacation- my sister now has a
degree of control over my mom
because she gives her 500$/month and pays her 12k/year property taxes. So i get a call from my mom crying and saying she’ll apologize for whatever she just can’t go to the police and go to jail- while part of me wants that, a friend who used to be a therapist told me “It’s like
you’re both living in the past with her” and i believe him- so putting aside the lies the bearings the S/a, i told my sister i feel it would be better if we just sought out professional help to work through this 20yr old trauma and just cut off contact with our mom, next time we see her should be at her funeral.
You can’t reason with a person like her who never sees herself as the aggressor as the demon as evil incarnate.
When i bring up this fact to my mom “How come 4/5 of us plus my sisters friends plus my friends-how come all these people remember reality one way and you’re the only one that remembers things the way you do? how come that’s the case? and she replied with” $ and your father’s brainwashing “ i laughed hung up and blocked her and told my sister i won’t be accompanying her to the police station- i want to seek therapy and move on with my life. My sister has ptsd and her brain just doesn’t remember a lot of these events me my dad and my other brother are cursed with remembering everything. There’s soooo much more i could put on about her- like specific scenarios where reality=A, and Her reality =ansisiehduehdwjsbsxhehwkdbdush

They are discharging her. Wtf is she that good at hiding shit or is psych at the hospital stupid. Shes texting me so she's been cleared by psych. She keeps saying I love you, and I just want to scream. Think a thick foam pillow would middle scream? 

the system fails again.  So tired of this I can't take care her mental needs. I just want to shut down I'm so stressed I'm hallucinating vividly. reality is weird. 

I still haven't slept probably won't till way later. 

Why do I even try to get her help when the medical system just doesn't care. 

The stray who I fed and let sleep on the porch came by severely injured. I will spare y'all the details. We have no money nor car for a vet.mil said to call animal control. He is an elderly at least 12 years old feral stray with no teeth. I highly doubt they will spend a dime to save him.

 It like when it rains it pours. That cat let me and only me pet him even though hes been here longer then me. We had a bond. He came home looking for help. I'm glad I was there to help him, he got right into the carrier I put outside to trap him so he didn't wander off. 

  I'm overwhelmed

Update 1- texted the 988 line someone commented. They walked em through calling 911 stayed on the line with me.  My wife is beyond pissed off at me
 She yelled at the emts for not wearing masks in our house.  But she ended up going because the emts told her it wasn't optional the amount she took was considered a suicide attempt. She didn't even look at me as she left.

I know I did the right thing. I should have done it sooner.

_____

OP

She tried to OD today she's only not in the hospital cause she threatened to leave me if I caused her to be in the psych ward again. But she took TWO huge according to her handfuls of her old lithium that for some reason didn't get thrown out. She says she did throw up about 20 minutes after taking them. So no idea how much actually got into her system.

I sat with her all day in her room and now we both have our bedroom doors open so we can hear each other and easily check on each other ,(our rooms are right next to each other we literally talk by simply talking loud) 

She won't go to the hospital I keep begging her. She has been dangerously suicidal for a year EVERY day she tells me in tears she wants to die. 
She says she will make an appt with a psychiatrist on Monday but she rarely ever keeps her psych appointments she always makes excuses even if it's a telehealth visit. Even if she does and they prescribe meds she won't take them. She will for a week and then stop saying they make her feel weird. I try explaining that that is normal and will go away but she would rather stop the meds entirely.

How can I help her get the help she needs? She says she isn't suicidal right now,but that's besides the pint she took a ton of lithium she needs to be monitored.
I'd prefer she go in the morning to the ER and from there the psych ward for medication management. She says she will take the meds if we go through scheduling on Monday but even so it could take months for her to get in to see someone psychiatrists are heavily booked in our area.

I'm scared I'm going to wake up and find her dead.

My friend died and I can't stop playing Valorant,117,0.97,1711999772.0,"I (23F) lost a close friend of mine (22F) last Wednesday. It was out of nowhere. We were supposed to hang out that night with our group of friends, but we didn't get to do that. And surely, it makes no sense to me and it never will.  
  
Since I first got the news, sleeping and eating are hard for me. Coincidentally, she passed away on Holy Week (religious holiday here in Latin America, from Thursday to Sunday) so after the memorial, I couldn't stop playing for 10 hours straight. I had to force myself to sleep to stop playing. I'm lucky enough to have found two people on queue which I started playing with and they made me feel better about this situation.  
  
Since today (Monday after Holy Week) isn't a holiday anymore, I had to start working and studying again. It's extremely hard to go back to the 9-5 routine. I had so many activities before this whole thing and I feel like I can't do them. I can just play Valorant to stop thinking about it but of course, it's unhealthy for me. Whenever I'm not playing, I'm thinking of my friend and my heart sinks. So I choose to play to have a little bit of fun and forget about it for a second.  
  
I'm thinking about therapy, since I'm not used to talking about my feelings nor am I good expressing myself. I know right now Valorant is a coping mechanism of mine and I need to give myself time because it's all very recent. I just don't want to get addicted to it in order to neglect my feelings.

One Bad Trip Changed My Life,114,0.93,1707582759.0,"On October 1st 2013, I smoked some weed. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was laced with an unknown substance. I had a horrific experience.

Well, a few weeks later, I ended up in the hospital for it. I acted deranged enough that they put me in the quiet room. I was only in the hospital for about a week or two, but I was forever fucked up by that experience. When they let me out, I had to stay with my grandparents because I couldn’t handle being at home for various reasons regarding details of the bad trip.

Now, that last part never happened, but you can imagine how fucked up I was that I believed that I did that. And it still haunts me as if it actually happened because it felt so real. I can still feel my cousin’s little neck in my hands and the cracking it made when I killed him, even though it never happened. I can still see the horror on everyone’s faces as they tried to pin me down. I can still feel my back against the carpet as they held me and cried.

It took about a year, but I got a hold of myself, and I slowly started to be able to differentiate between my vivid imagination and reality again, and I haven’t had trouble with it since. But occasionally, I stop and I wonder if I am indeed still sitting in the quiet room, just imagining all of this.",mentalhealth,thewistfuldrifter,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ank7h9/one_bad_trip_changed_my_life/,43,122.58064516129032,8.58064516129032,0.0002631270811707576

I despise men and lose sleep after multiple violent incidents caused by them,115,0.78,1704206335.0,"I am 22F. The hatred and anger I feel about men now isn't healthy and I can't stop feeling this way. I watched my boyfriend be attacked from behind while he was in the bathroom and he was nearly blinded/killed. I had to throw myself between them as he had passed out. I was taking punches trying to keep his head protected because he had passed out while the men behind the bar and owner (who didnt hire a bouncer) just watched and shouted and didn't step in. It only stopped after he ran away and I was screaming for help. No one called the police or ambulance I had to call his dad to pick us up  After that incident I havent been able to sleep I got put on 5 pills by my psychiatrist to deal with the trauma and flashbacks. I have never went to a party/club and that was our 4th time out. Yesterday at new years the second time we have went out since the incident a man threatened me for moving a jacket, which I moved so I could sit down (it wasn't his, it wasn't mine, the guy who's jacket it was is up dancing he doesn't even know the guy) I wasn't about to sit on someone's jacket so shifted it up a bit so I could sit with my group. It was moved 5 inches and he had 2 seats of space ). I could feel my anxiety creep up after the threat and my boyfriend told him to calm down, there is no issue here and this man slid up behind me (he was 2 metres away) and started threatening my boyfriend telling him to meet him outside. My boyfriend rolled his eyes ignored him and just put his arm around me and kept talking to the group. At this point I was having flashbacks, I started having a bad panic attack, I couldn't breath, tears were streaming, I was gasping for breath. Boyfriend and his cousin noticed and got me outside so I could breathe where the bouncer came up to say he could understand where he was coming from since he was there first (I still have no clue how me not wanting to sit on a strangers jacket and moving it beside me so I wasn't on top of it is worthy of his behaviour) At this point I was just saying between gasps 'i dont actually care about that I'm just having ptsd I don't need this right now'    bouncer walked away and I was being calmed down between panic attacks. I woke up this morning with intense anger. I can't let it go. IV had enough of grown men not being able to control themselves and being violent over something a simple as a jacket that wasn't even his or someone he knows. I'm going to my psychiatrist soon because I can't keep living like this. I have had an abusive father who abused us and my brother has physically attacked me leaving me with bruises and a bloody nose over wanting to watch football in the living room. It's going to be a while before I get an appointment and I'm just not wanting to go outside for fear of something happening. It's consuming my every thought and I start shaking in anger over my disgust with men.

I've never wanted to smack the obnoxious, defiant, vindictive, disrespect out of anyone the way I want to with her. 

ESPECIALLY when she uses her sweet, innocent 4yo sister as her main scapegoat...

(The behaviors started five years before she had a sibling so it may inflame it, but it is certainly not the cause.)

I am in a perpetual state of anger, defensiveness, sadness, resentment, shame, self-loathing, and dread. 

I can't keep existing this way...

__________________________________________
**EDITED TO ADD CONTEXT**

My daughter is 13yo.  She has been struggling with ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder), ADHD, and HFA since she we put the pieces together when she was about 3.5yo.

The main issue is her ODD.  If you're not familiar with ODD first-hand, it's really hard to understand the full scope.  She has 3-7 SCREAMING tantrums throughout the course of any normal day.  These typically last a minimum of 20 minutes to upwards of 90 minutes.  Not a single syllable of that is exaggerated.  They will start over simple things like me asking her if she washed her hands before making lunch, her refusing to figure out how to solve simple problems (ex: there's clothes in the dryer and she needs to switch her clothes over), or getting caught in a lie (ex: I can see from the security camera that she did X and she will scream and get violent trying to lie about it).  Before we started homeschooling, we were getting phone calls to pick her up at least 2, if not 3, times per week because she was being violent with the teachers and disruptive of the learning environment.  

These are all very literal, real examples. These literally happen every day... since she was 3yo.

We have done ALL the things... psychiatrist, in-home therapist, special needs program at school, different pediatricians, school social workers, read the books, tried the tactics.  We have heard from no less than a dozen professionals ""wow, you're doing all of the things we typically suggest"" -- but nothing works!  (And I'm Sicilian, so discipline is not lost on me.)

You can imagine the toll this takes on our family life when so much time and effort is put into ending her tantrums so we can do things and go places, including canceling vacations, not attending family events, etc.  For the past 1.5yrs, she's started to get really jealous of her little sister (who is currently 4yo) and she is now her scapegoat.  The added stress of having to protect my innocent, sweet little girl from someone she worships is too much.

The resentment comes from how much emotional energy, time, and money we've put into trying to help her over the past decade+ since we isolated the diagnoses with NO return or no change and, if anything, escalating behaviors as the teen 'tude sets in.  It's like living in an emotional warzone and I would be struggling even if I weren't also BPD and struggling on my own.

Hope that clarifies for the people who were asking about discipline, where the resentment comes from, etc.",mentalhealth,Complete-Scar-2077,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15bg64h/my_kid_is_my_main_bpd_trigger_and_i_cant_handle/,120,121.11111111111111,12.111111111111114,0.00025997263370642986

My mom claims she has thousands of bugs crawling on her,105,0.99,1707336011.0,"I don’t know what to do anymore. My mom 54 years old has been convinced for the last 3 months that she has scabies, or mite infestations. I want to let it known that just over a year ago she was in the hospital for three weeks due to a nervous breakdown. She was having “shakes” and “shocks”, the doctors could never figure out was wrong. 

Life was okay for a couple of months after she got better she was off work for 8 months. She went back to work 4 months ago when all of this started. She started telling our house that the animals had fleas, which then turned into mites. She bought medication for all our animals and claimed the were more free.( even with no evidence whatsoever they even had them to begin with)

About a month later she started telling us that she thinks there’s mites on the furniture. She cleaned the whole house, along with all the furniture and starting making homemade sprays to kill the “mites”. 

About a week later she told my dad that she has scabies. She said she found a rash on herself and that she knows it scabies. Instead of going to our family doctor she called a over the phone clinic where she spoke to someone over the phone who said they recommended scabies cream. She then proceeded to buy said cream and use it. She bought it again and used it again. She now uses scabies cream every week. She has these hives in her body, she’s been putting lotion all over her body along with tea tree oil and homemade mixers as well. She also took all the furniture out of her bedroom, along with clothes and anything really. She then took all the couches out of the living room. Claiming they were infested. 

She refuses to go see a dermatologist, or have an ink test done or a scratch test for mites. She has 4 showers a day boiling hot, along with doing her bedding two times a day. Every time she naps she washes them. She has spent about 3 thousand dollars on mattress covers and new clothes. For the first couple of weeks my dad was supportive and helping her. We all put in this cream to help ease her mind. There’s 4 people living in our house. 

Fast forward 2 months and my mother is very un hinged. I’m feeling extremely uncomfortable living with her. She’s constantly picking at her skin and picking at her bed claiming any little piece of dirt she mites is a mite. She’s even been in my room along with my nans looking at our beds for “ evidence “.

I’m currently looking for a place of my own since I simply can’t handle her anymore. I don’t know what to do and neither does my dad. He’s been supporting her, and trying to understand. But now I feel like someone needs to do something. I’ve heard of Delusional parasitosis, and so far everything I’ve been reading sounds just like what’s been happening to her. 

Today I caught her picking at her skin along with putting a whole bottle of tea tree oil in her hair. She has hives on her neck, as she keeps scratching and picking. She pops the bites on her head claiming she can feel thousands of babies all over her whenever she does this. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. As I fear I’m getting more and more worried about her mental health, she’s starting to scare me. I want to be there and support her but I also don’t want to be an enabler. 

It’s hard to talk to my dad about this, as he claims that we should just let her medicate and use the lotion and hopefully they will go away if she will relax. He’s not really helping the situation. It’s also important to note that my mom does use marijuana, and it’s on anxiety and depression, medication, as well as sleep medication.

I was sexually abused when I was 10 by my mother's younger brother and my parents didn't do anything about it. ,104,0.99,1711374920.0,"I was 10 and I visited his house with my mother that winter. We were in their bedroom and having dinner on the floor (his wife, my mom and me). He was on the bed, under a blanket, watching TV. All of a sudden, he calls me to get under the blanket. I didn't want to go but my mom pushed me to go. Then my mom and aunt left the room to do the dishes downstairs. He switched the channel to a religious one where holy songs were being played. Then he proceeded to molest me. He hugged me tightly, tried to kiss my lips, then ran his hands all over my body. I could feel his penis against me. Then he slided in his hands under my clothes and rubbed my private parts. I don't know why I couldn't leave the moment he started touching me inappropriately. I just laid there like a corpse. The trance broke when I heard my cousin come back downstairs. I told him that I needed to go and left. I couldn't speak about this to anybody for the fear of broken relationships. I had to share the house with that monster for the next couple of days. I started developing severe anxiety right after that incident and still hasn't gone away. Although I never spoke to him after that incident, I had to be in the same vicinity because of our familial ties. And it was deeply uncomfortable but I kept shut. 
After 12 years of this, I revealed it to my mother in a fit of rage and she blamed me for not revealing it to her earlier. Her stance was clear that she couldn't do anything about it because it was too late, and it's difficult to pick between your child and your sibling. I was shocked beyond anything by this. When I shared this with my dad after a while, he assured me plainly on the surface and moved on. He continues to share a good relationship with that man, so does my mother. But anytime I bring this up, they try their best to make it seem like it's not a big deal and I should move on because it has been too long. Who is going to make them understand that I haven't been able to process this incident and it ruined what was left of my childhood. I fully understand that my parents' validation to something doesn't define my life. But it's difficult when you live in a brown household. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety since then. There's no way to reverse my suffering. 
I am beyond disgusted and pained to write everything in such excruciating details but I have never shared the deetz with anyone in the past 13 years. I don't expect anything out of this. I just want to get my voice out and let people hear me.

This class did not come without it’s bumps, we started out with 18 and by week three had 11 due to one particular student who could not grasp the concept of the job we where training for. And when she was told she was wrong she would get verbal and at on point physical. And then we went down too 8 as some drama happened between certain class members and one quit while one got fired. 

Now onto me, these class rooms where small and the noise would echo. I get overstimulated as I have extreme anxiety and depression which I’m medicated for but recently the medications haven’t been working. I just got insurance so I was planning on seeing a therapist but until then I was pushing on like a normal human. I had a few times where the overstimulation made me cry so I removed myself for a couple of minutes with the teachers permission and then I would return. I had a panic attack one day as one of the class mates got mad and yelled in my face triggering a episode. But again I removed myself from the room, spoke with the teacher who said I was fine and returned to class. Everyones performance stayed the same and the duties we where doing did not get affected.

30 minutes and happy birthday to me! 🎂,102,0.99,1683171014.0,"I didn’t think I’d be around for this long, I made a promise to my friend when I was healing and becoming clean and that helped wonders- 4 years ago and now I’m slowly learning to establish boundaries. I’m learning more about myself than I’ve ever before. My parents tell me I’ve wasted time, useless, can’t be helped and why I passed off so much. But looking back from the progress of where I came from to now, I’ve grown tremendously and beautifully- I’ve changed as a person for the better and I’m not in a self destructive state with a better mental health, attempted eating habits, and knowing my limits and self care despite maybe needing asd diagnosis test and an adhd one. 

I now know not to put myself through self sacrifice to help others due to parental trauma and I’ve learned not to beg for love that’ll never return to me from my parents but that’s still a work in process. I’ll eventually seek therapy again for my health but for the time being, I am proud to say- I’m turning into an adult soon. I had matured too early due to absent parenting but that will heal someday. That concludes everything, my promise to not self destruct to my friend ends tonight but I’ll always keep that promise to my heart for the rest of my life.

Is it possible that you get dumber after being in a long period of acute depression/bad mental state?,99,1.0,1693918684.0,"(I apologize for the wording of the question and the choice of words that I made in the post)

I went through a period where I was at an all times low in my life in every way imaginable. For 2 years straight I suffered so badly from depression that I had to quit my job, and university, I shunned all my friends and fought constantly with my family, and my physical health declined so badly that I am battling level 1 hypertension and have gone half bald at 24. It led me to attempt to end my life 4 times and I had (what I assume to be) multiple episodes of psychosis. I am now in a relatively better place (I am back in university and am becoming social slowly). The problem is, I can't do any of the things I used to do.

I used to be great with art, I drew, painted, wrote in my spare time, and even worked as a fashion designer. Now I can't draw a straight line to save my life. I also used to love to go on hikes, ride my bike, and go swimming. I can't do any of it, despite being trained and playing in my school's swimming team from when I was 8 until I was 16.

One of my friends has a history of battling depression and anxiety (and have attempted multiple time in the past). She also lost some function until she started going to a psychiatrist and therapist. I didn't have professional help and tried therapy for months but it didn't do much.

With that being said, what's your experience with regression after depression? Do you think people get ""dumber"" or lose mental/motor functions after being in a long period of depression?

Yeah my wife wants to leave me,95,0.98,1682064717.0,"I found a letter she wrote that she intended to give to me tomorrow. I was by myself, alone and my house. My wife had left for something I wasn’t invited to and I happened across the letter. 

Basically the whole thing boils down to she thinks I’m unhappy in our marriage, she says she’s unhappy with our marriage and wants to begin the process for divorce.

This shattered me to a million pieces.lately I’ve been dealing with more stress and anxiety than I ever have and finding that letter broke me.

I told her I found the letter and I had left one of my own explaining the mental health issues I’ve been dealing with, apologizing for her being drawn into it and for all the times I tried to cope in an unhealthy way.

my wife is going to tell me she wants a divorce. I do not want a divorce.

Tomorrow is going to be an extremely difficult day for me  (or today at this point by now)

I’ve seen the writing on the wall, I haven’t been the husband she deserves for a multitude of reasons but, she’s been the wife I’ve needed to keep me under control.

I don’t want to lose my wife. I wrote a letter for her explaining in excruciating detail that I’ve been dealing with mental health issues that have otherwise left me failing as a proper husband and consistently letting her down and breaking promises (not in spite of her) 

I know what’s coming and I dread it more than anything I ever have before. Tomorrow is judgement day it would seem and I’m worried about how I’m going to manage without her should she ultimately decide to leave.

I have no intention of forcing her to stay in a marriage she is unhappy in, I just feel like we’ve never really tried to make things work and I want to at the very least try.

We’re going to talk tomorrow about how we are going to proceed and I really just need some support.

I don’t know what her absolute decision will be but based on what I read, she has been done with this marriage for long time

I still love her, she is the only reason I have a degree and a job related to the degree I obtained.

This past March was our 5th year wedding anniversary, I did not anticipate that it could be our last. 

I’ve been stuck in a dark place for the past few weeks and I don’t want to lose my wife.

She seems to think we’ve been living a loveless marriage, which I will accept blame for not fulfilling my end of the intimacy aspect of the relationship. I don’t meant to imply this is entirely my fault however I do accept that in my imperfect actions as a husband also contributed to this situation.

My wife seems to think I don’t love her. I do, more than I could ever explain.

I travel frequently for work and I feel like this has not only contributed to the strife in my marriage but also driven me to the brink of insanity.

I took the job because it was the best offer after I a graduated and I thought it would be in both of our interests for me to take it as it was a significant pay increase compared to what I was making. (I did not make this decision without her)

I think this job has contributed to the downfall of the relationship between my wife and myself.

These next few days are going to be very hard for me, I feel like I’ve matured 10 years over the span of a week, the stress and anxiety have been unbearable. 

I don’t want to lose my wife, she is the light in my life but, I’m not going to try to force her to stay in a marriage that she does not think she can be happy in.

It’s rough, guys and I am not looking forward to our conversation but, I need to find closure one way or the other or I’m going to lose my mind.



***********************UPDATE************************

I have just reopened Reddit since posting this. There are a lot of comments and I will get around to answering those of you I am able to as I am able to.

Just as a little general answer as to how things are at the moment: 

I’ve found peace in this situation and have been preparing myself for whatever the final outcome of my marriage is.

I’ve been staying with my parents for a week, I’ve been getting counseling, I was started in an antidepressant and right now I’m going through the wonderful effects that starting an antidepressant brings.

My wife and I are separating for a year, she is taking our dog and will be living in Iowa with her grandmother for the next year until she has to return for school.

I feel like I’m starting to come out of a lifetime of being on autopilot and feel hope for my future for the first time in years.

That’s all I can think of for now, heads a little fuzzy because of antidepressant but overall mental health is looking up at the moment.

I was sexually abused as a boy,94,0.97,1699495741.0,"Well, that's the first time I talk about it at all. I'm 20 now and I suffered abuse since I cannot remember until I was 11. It took a long time to realize what happened to me was wrong and a longer time to realize I was not the wrong side. Until this, how I say, my mind was a straight up hell.

&#x200B;

I was a shy and isolated child. I actually talked a lot with my close ones, but introvert at all, nothing wrong. I remember when I was around 5, my grandmother told me to lie down with her in the bed. I refused at first, but she insisted so much that I accepted. She then started to talk about things involving sexual organs and how it was important to me to know the female body(remembering, I was 5). She asked me if I had ever seen a woman naked, so I told something like ""I've taken showers with my cousin(my age, call her 'Ana')"". Then she literally pulled down her pants and asked me to touch it, to ""know how it is"". I remember feeling very embarrassed and uncomfortable, and she said something like ""you have not to feel any wrong with this, it's like your cousin, but bigger"". Fucked up.

&#x200B;

Later, when I was 7-8, I was pretty often in her house, since my parents worked the whole day. So I often ate, took showers and slept there. Just to say, Some nights I couldn't sleep because that bedroom made me terrified(I actually didn't know why at this time). My younger brother and cousin(male) also were often there. At this age, she put us together in bath and, honestly, nothing inappropriated ever happened during these times. For some reason, the disturbing things happened only when we were alone, and she developed some creepy obsession with me, I will explain later.

&#x200B;

She had one of those electric massage tools, you know. She liked to massage my body with that, and I liked it in the beggining. She massaged my shouders, arms and feet, and that felt really good. But with time, she started to spend more and more time putting that thing over my chest and legs, until she put it over my genitals. I think that was my first orgasm, because the feeling was so intense and unexpected(also my body was probably aroused by the preliminary contact, but I couldn't know what is was). I had never experienced an erection at this time, but even so my genitals were ""wet"" when I went to bathroom. She made it more times, but not so intense, she kinda passed the tool around my legs and stomach and sometimes put it over the genitals, for a little time. She always told me I was her favourite grandchild, the most handsome, and other kinds of praises that made me feel disgusting.

&#x200B;

Sadly, the signs of abuse started to appear at that time. I became more introvert in school and, sometimes, I really froze when talking to people, and couldn't make many friends. I became aroused too. I felt I had the need of masturbate, not periodically because it felt good, but almost every day led by pure anxiety and that felling that it's the only way you were taught to do. fortunately, I never extended this to other people, but always kept it to myself(actually it fucked my mental health, but I honestly prefer this than become an abuser and victimizing and hurt other people). I remember taking baths with my cousin(yeah, that one I told in the bed) at my 9-10 and I never made any sexual play or talk with her. I only had a bit of curiosity about her vagina(also she about my penis), but those thoughts faded away when we started playing of throwing water at each other and make silly beards with foam. Those are actually good memories, which is kinda ironical in my opinion.

&#x200B;

So I hit puberty. I was 11 and, for privacy reasons, I told her I didn't want to take my baths with cousins or brothers. Anyways, she was until in the bedroom(there were a bedroom and bathroom, no door between them) and it was not a problem at all, I've taken many baths with she watching before. One day, After I finished the bath, I got up to shower the foam off and asked her for the towel. I always made this, but that time, well, I had an erection. Not first time, but first in front of someone. Well, she basically touched me very inapropriately, not going to give details here.

&#x200B;

I took baths there only a few times more, until I stopped totally to go there and stayed alone in home. In these days before I took this decision, her obsession about me and my body became sick. when I was in the bathroom, she started to massage my body and making awful comments about my penis. Yeah, some sick things like ""how can something be so thick, do you do exercises for it to grow?"", ""the girls will be crazy when you put this in front of them"" and ""your girlfriend will be a very happy girl with this"". Sorry for the girls reading this. Uh, my parts are actually very normal, and it's not a problem to me. I really care way more about feelings and caring than the body, and I'm pretty sure I could only stay with a girl if she felt the same. But now I know that she was doing had never to do with caring or increasing my self steem, but some distrubing way to catch me psychologically.

&#x200B;

Still in this bath part, she touched me very times, in the whole body. One day she took my phone that I had left in my pants and started reading my personal messages. There was really nothing I should be worried about, but it made me very uncomfortable too. Another day, after I took my clothes off, she said me to wait because she wanted to take a bath first. So she undressed in front of me and I obviously had an erection. She didn't touch me but I could see by her face that she was very satisfied producing that. That day was the more disturbing. After she finished, she told me to get in(She got out and dressed first, fortunately) and take my turn. I did, and when I get out, she told me to lie down in the bed, because she had noticed I had ""a rash on my inner thighs"" and she needed to see it. I honestly cannot describe what I was feeling. A mix of anxiety, fear, and somehow, arousal. When she pulled my towel off, I had a full erection. She put an oinment in my thighs and then started with that twisted comments about my body, penis and girls. So she put an oil in her hands and started, you know what. It may feel disturbing, but she moved her hands so passionately over my testicles and penis that it really looked like she was pleasing herself. I knew I should stop that, I should run away and tell someone, but at that time I felt so, uh, horny maybe, that I just couldn't stop it. I feel it extremely disgusting, but I think whoever experienced an orgasm knows exactly what I'm talking about. Well, then I came in her hands and that was the last time I went there.

&#x200B;

The last part was the worst of all, no doubts. I was in later middle school and I had always got the best grades in every subject, but my grades ""suddenly"" decreased to hell. To worsen the situation, my math teacher was very harsh and blamed me everytime for getting bad grades. I stopped doing things I liked before and lost 30kg (66 pound) in a very short time. I got also kind of addicted to porn, since it was the only thing that could distract me even for a few minutes. The rest of the time was pure torment in my head. I also had nocturnal panic and some weird things like imagining that there were demons or monsters in my bedroom. My family is evangelical, and it didn't help me much. Everytime I went to the church, I could feel anything but shame and guilt, feeling as I was not worth of being there. And, since I had not friends or someone I could trust to open myself, I always ended up believing those thoughs were true.

&#x200B;

When I was to get into middle school, I moved to other school. It's not necessary to say that my mind was not healthy and I couldn't make lasting relationship bonds. I was getting good grades again, but no one of my friends of that time remains close to me today, except by that cousin, Ana, who studied with me in high school. We had a good friendship, and our talks are almost always about music, school and politics. Since we are relatives and were very close in childhood, she felt ok to talk about sex with me sometimes, but always in a respectful way. Her concerns were most about having sex before marriage, and I said her if she wanted to be with her boyfriend for life and both felt ok with that, it shouldn't there be any problem(she's with the same guy until today and they are happy, I feel really glad for her). Today she's in 2nd year to become a psychologist. Sometimes I think about talking these things with her, but I really don't feel secure to open up.

&#x200B;

In my last year in middle school, I got really depressed. I lost my will to live and have a future, I didn't got into college and abandoned all my social circle. The only thing I did in this time was work, go to church and sleep. Despite my shame feelings never left, I always prayed to God to help me, at least, don't give up on everything. I think I'm doing well actually. 

&#x200B;

In my 19, I took my drive license. I thought I wouldn't be able to do it, due to my high anxiety level and a almost constant headache I have, but I did and I drive pretty well. I am also going to do exams to get into a college the next week. I'm not full confident that I will pass but I promised to not desperate and try again next year if I fail. I also found a girl that became one of the most important parts of my life. We are not in love yet, but I can feel she likes me the same way I like her. She laughs at all my jokes and pay attention when I'm talking, and it really makes a great difference. I don't struggle with thoughts like ""if I had found someone like her before I could have avoided a lot of suffering"" because I know that find someone like her is very rare and, anyways, she turns my days way lighter and brighter, and hard things have become easier to do. My greatest fear was how my body would react when we got close. I'm not talking about sex, and I don't want to think about it until the marriage(we're both evangelicals so it's ok), but normal physical contact. Fortunately, I discovered that I like her touch, and stay close feels very confortable, like the opposite I used to feel. I'm not gonna lie, I still have nightmares, flashbacks and panic, I still struggle with porn sometimes(very very few times, but when it happens I feel like those days), but I'm doing my best. When I feel depressed, it's like the time around me had stopped and I don't have forces to do anything, but I'm taking less time to recover than in other times. I've made good friends in the church and work, and the familiy of my girl is like a second family for me. Well, today my life is divided by fews days when I feel absolutely hopeless and some days when I have force, even feeling bad, shameful and empty I can do my best to have a future when I'll be free of this.

PS: if someone is worried about my brother and cousins, they are all well. I really don't believe they went through this things, I've always kept an eye over all of them to not let the same thing that happened to me happen to them, and they are all ok, both physical and mentally.

I berated myself for not being where I wanted to be. I blamed myself for every single failure, and couldn't see a way out. I pretended, I masked, until I allowed it to continue spiralling to this point. I spent months in utter silence, rejecting any support thrown my way.  

Today, an academic advisor from my university did not show up to a very important meeting which I barely managed to fit in before my deadline. I was at a breaking point, feeling that I somehow just needed to summon every last bit of energy in myself to deal with the irritating and never-ending minute problems of every single day. All these minute things had become far more important than anything else.

So, this happy, queer, and relatably autistic and disorganised man I already vaguely knew took me in instead. I'd seen him before, he had forgotten something he needed to submit from me, some silly admin thing. We had laughed about the fact that two severely ADD people would forget about this tiny thing months and months on end, having the same conversation every 6 months when the dread would pop back in our minds. 

Today, he took me in. Nonchalantly, the busiest man I know just went ""Since you're already here, come in! No problem."" 

He not only heard me, but he told me exactly what I needed to hear, and he probably has absolutely no idea. I know he saw me. He never blamed me, he never made me feel ashamed of myself. In the few minutes after he had noticed that I was sitting outside an empty office with my advisor missing, he already went to find all information he could on me so that he could give me the best advice. He told me I mattered, he told me I belonged, and he gave me the one thing I felt I had lost; he reminded me that I do have control over my life. I can decide where I go. It doesn't matter that my path doesn't look the way I thought it 'should' (whatever that means), and that it doesn't look the way my peers' do. 

Leaving that office, after a mere thirty minute conversation with him, I walked 2 hours before coming home, before sitting and writing a thank you to him, and before realising that he had just saved my life. 

You have nothing to lose by knocking on doors when you need it. Do not underestimate what help can do for you, no matter the scale of it. That's it; this nice friendly academic advisor.

I can't stop thinking about my brother,88,0.97,1699407085.0,"Hi everyone.  
What I’m about to write will probably be super confusing, disgusting, and weird. But, I have no one I can tell and so, I’m here on Reddit telling strangers. 

  
My(21) brother(19) is always doing explicit sexual things in front of me. Not entirely explicit, but explicit enough. He likes to go around the house naked. He comes in my room and stands by my bed and waves his dick at me. He asks me if I want to suck it. He comes in my room in the morning with morningwood and in his underwear. At random times, he’ll come in my room gully dressed, but grabbing is crotch and asking me to stroke it through his jeans. He always comments on my body and always tries and sometimes does grab my butt. He says, word for word “You have such a fucking juicy ass” “Get on the bed” “I’m gonna fuck you”. He moans our names and will randomly be sitting their and moans “oh oh I’m gonna cum”.

  
There’s so much more but in the moment I can’t remember.

  
Now I know, the simple solution to this would be to lock my door. But he will break down my door.   
Or I could tell my parents, but they already know and they don’t care. They say “he’s crazy, there’s nothing we can do about it”. They don’t understand that my brothers actions are effecting me mentally. Another solution would be for me to move out. But, I love my mom and if I left, my dad and his family would emotionally and mentally abuse my mom. Which is not something I would like. However this is probably what I will do in the near future.

  
I’m not here really looking for a solution though. Especially since I do plan on moving out in a year after saving some more money. I’m here just to put how I feel into words, especially in regards to how it is effecting me. I didn’t realize just how badly my brother doing this was a effecting me until recently. I’m an avid romance novel reader. However, I can not get through the romantic/explicit scenes in books anymore. My brother keeps popping up in my mind and I immediately have to close the book. I can’t even masturbate without his image. And it turns me off. I don’t think I can even have someone touch me or hear sexual words without my brothers face coming in my mind. 

  
It’s killing me on the inside and I don’t know what to do. It’s disgusting and I’m trying so hard to block it out, but I can’t. I just want to have fun, live life, read a damn romance book in peace, but I can’t.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that I am female, as some people are wondering. Also, it seems like people think that this post is some sort of incest porn fantasy. Which to me, sounds outrageous and honestly pretty hurtful and it seems like people are trying to invalidate what goes on in my life. But this is my reality.

The issue is, that I've been noticing a slow but steady deterioration of my mental sharpness, I don't feel as mental sharp, feels like a slog to come up with ideas or even basic things.. like coming up with conversation topics or keeping up with conversations. I have EXTREME short term memory loss, sometimes I bring myself a glass of water and can't even remember going to get it.. or remembering what I just said in a span of 5 mins. I also have a tough time recollecting broad information. At the start, when it was milder, I thought it was a normal aging process, but as I got worse I couldnt help but think there was something more going on and Im extremely worried this will only get worse with time. Brain fog and feeling stupid most of the time.. and while I don't want to make myself seem full of myself, but I felt I was an extremely smart and sharp kid. I can barely recognize myself

"My therapist made a racial comment. Im desperate for therapy, but think I should cut her loose. Am I overreacting?",85,0.92,1711563973.0,"I just started therapy again, and have had 3 sessions with a therapist. I am a Black female and my therapist is a Black female.

We were discussing something related to germs. I can sometimes be “overly clean” and a bit of a “clean freak” which sometimes crosses the line into unhealthy and causes me anxiety. 

My fiancé is a white male. And although I don’t recall exactly what was said before my therapist  made the racial comment, I think i was   talking to her about how when we go to our Friends’ houses I often get picky about what I eat, drink out of etc.

Anyway, I forget what was said directly before she made this statement, but at one point my therapist said:  “Well, you know White people can be a little …..” . And  either she finished the sentence with “not that clean” OR, she made a face suggesting unclean. I honestly can’t remember, but her tone and body language made it very clear what she was suggesting. She was assuming it was a white person’s house and was essentially saying “Well maybe you being picky about those things is justified since white people can be a little nasty.” 

People are very comfortable talking to me, and in this case I think she got waaaaay too comfortable and slipped and shared this thought/bias like I’m just one of her friends.

I honestly  don’t think she is racist or meant any harm, BUT the comment was troublesome(for my reasons below) and I don’t think I want to work with her anymore. But I really need therapy. Should I stay or get on the hunt for someone else?

1.) Therapist are humans and yes have their own biases and stereotypes, but when you’re in sessions it’s your job to remain unbiased and not speak on racial stereotypes

Traumatized by being tasered and handcuffed by police during wellness check,85,0.97,1685021736.0,"Has anyone else ever been apprehended by police or had force used on them during a mental health situation and if if you have how do you cope with it? If you haven’t, what do you think about this and would you cope?

So a few months ago I called 911 because I felt like self harming. First I actually called something called here 24/7 which a mental health hotline and they told me if I want to self harm then I should probably call the police. 

My partner was with me and called with me and we both told the 911 dispatch I was feeling like self harming and I had a small kitchen knife to my thigh but I didn’t cut yet.

I told the 911 dispatch I was afraid the police would hurt me because I know they are aggressive sometimes and I work for the newspaper so I hear about what happens. She reassured me that are coming to “help” and I’ve had the police called by neighbours for arguments between my bf and I before and usually they’ve somewhat helpful, one time they even brought a mental health counsellor so I thought it would be like that. I just wanted some intervention to help me get out of that crazy head space.

So when the police came barging in they were screaming drop the knife (I was holding it to my leg lol) and I said no ONCE before I could even look up they tasered me. They had a riot shield, a gun and a taser pointed me at me when they came barging in screaming at me. Mind you, this is Canada.

The police officer who tasered me kept apologizing and saying to my bf “my friend just died like this and I panicked” or some shit. Like wow. The female cop there and the EMS told me there is usually a lot of deescalation tactics before that like they try to talk you down and stuff but they didn’t and they usually ever use force if they feel in danger. They told me to file a report against them because it was  very abnormal and they felt sorry for me. Imagine. 

They told me to and my mom told me to file a report and even get a lawyer because guess what when I got to the hospital they told me the police wrote on the report I said I “wanted to die by suicide by police” like yoooo I said the complete opposite to the dispatcher!!! I was AFRAID of them hurting me. I would never ever say something so foolish and I am NOT suicidal. So, they told me I should clear my name because it’s not safe or good at all to have that on my file and next time something happens they’ll be even more aggressive.

But I didn’t wanna relive the trauma so I didn’t (stupid) and fast forward to this week a neighbour called cause my bf and I got into a huge fight and I had a mark on my head cause I self harmed by hitting my head against the wall. They asked me and him if I was suicidal and we both said no not at all. They didn’t even ask me to go with them in the ambulance like usual for the mandatory mental health check, the paramedics came and asked me if I wanted to get my HEAD looked at and I said no. The police said ONCE “you’re going to the hospital for a check” and I was holding my cat in my arms and said “I don’t want to though” once and they literally attacked me so fast twisted my arms so aggressively and handcuffed me. I was crying yelling like WTF I WILL GO VOLUNTARILY U DONT NEED TO HANDCUFF ME UR HURTING ME. It was horrible they hurt me so much and dragged me like an animal when I kept saying unhandcuff me I will go voluntarily….if I had known they were gonna do that I obviously would’ve just went. Why would I want to be handcuffed and treated like that? I’m not that crazy.

I was at the hospital for 10 hours alone with no phone waiting to be discharged bc there was only 1 ER doctor and my bf “couldn’t handle being there and needed space” or some shit.

I don’t want to use the word trauma incorrectly but I said it because I feel like I have symptoms of it.

The story is that since I was around 12, my dad would put on movies that involved women being sexually assaulted and abused. They bothered me but they didn’t horrify me as much as when I was 16. That year my dad put on two movies called “Hollow Man” and “Sleepers” which are also movies that also featured sexual assault but for some reason these movies made me cry the most and still scares me to this day (I’m 19 going onto 20 now). The scenes of these movies essentially come back to my memory randomly if I get too deep in my thoughts and it rattles me. It’s been so bad that the horror even affects me when I am in public. I feel uncomfortable when people look at me and I worry they may try to hurt me or even my loved ones. The thoughts of the scenes and the idea of people hurting me and loved ones like that plague me more now that I am studying so much and sleeping less. It also makes me anxious whenever my father puts on a movie to the point I google the plot to mentally prepare. I tend to watch kids movies because I know that will be safe.

However, I am becoming older and will soon have to have my own life outside of my parents so I am more afraid of stepping into this scary world myself.

2) not showing interest in MY interests. When I was growing up, my parents (esp. my mom) didn't really show any reaction to what I liked. For instance, when I would tell her about it, she would just shrug.

I think I’m being emotionally abused and I don’t know what to do,81,0.97,1691581773.0,"I’m 35F and have been married for a decade now. I’m Indian and this is an arranged marriage.

Within 3 months of my marriage, my husband got to know of a past relationship of mine, something I hadn’t shared with him. I was no longer in touch with my x and it seemed pretty pointless bringing him up. But this was something he was (and still is) unable to overlook. He made me call my parents, my brother and threatened to divorce me, leaving everyone in a bad spot within our community.

Of course, the divorce didn’t happen, but thus began the unending emotional abuse. From gaslighting, twisting my words, to blaming me for his depression (since knowing your wife has an x is valid grounds for depression) he covered the entire nine yards. 

Things got better late 2021, I’m not entirely sure why. I think it was because thanks to Covid, we were forced to wfh, be with each other for hours on end. He possibly saw me for the person I am - and not what he made presumed I’ll be.

Flash forward to today. Last night, he wanted to get intimate. But having worked 12 hours at a high stress job, plus the extra effort to take care of his parents (who are currently visiting us), my cup was empty. Come this morning and he vehemently said - “I cannot continue to stay married to you. I feel disrespected. My parents are here, I’ll share all the truth about your past and divorce you.” That’s always the sword he’s wielding at me. 

Additionally, he blamed me for everything that went wrong with him - a mediocre rise in his career (he has my dream career, I don’t know why he complains), his heart problem (the tests that I pushed him to get - they came back normal), his weight gain, everything.

What should I do to release this tension BUT in a safe way?    
(I did ""share"" my nudes to two strangers previously -- regretted it afterward, felt unsafe)

Edit: STOP DM-ing FOR NUDES!!!!!! I’m gonna block y’all

———————————————————————————
ADDITIONAL EDIT: just wanna give a few updates from after talking to my therapist and after reading some of your suggestions too. (I haven’t read all of them esp the very recent ones—was planning to reply to them, but I’m losing all my energy now as it’s 3 AM here already in my place). A little TMI, I’m also diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder.

Here’s what my therapist said: [ … You can send it to your friends, or post in anonymous Twitter account with 0 follower. You can take as many as you can (to get you distracted) then back it up on your Cloud/Drive account. Send it to yourself is also another alternative. Make sure those photos do not feature your face. Better yet, keep your phone under lock & key and only retrieve it when you are calmed down. Hope it helps. You got this! ]

What I did by far:
1. Creating a spare insta account with 0 followers, started by uploading my normal, non-nudes selfies, ended up not sending nudes at all because I was too busy looking at my selfies and uploading them right before I got to open my hidden nudes folder haha (sorry if it sounds too cringeworthy—kinda feel cute these days). 

2. Impulsively uploaded normal, proper selfies to a subreddit and somehow felt better about it (except for some of the disgusting DMs part). Hope it doesn’t sound narcissistic but, it felt good looking at the number of DM requests though I didn’t reply to them [BUT I truly don’t appreciate some of the DMs coming from this particular post from r/mentalhealth because, apparently, those people intentionally take advantage of me and no, I don’t reply to them :)]

3. Talked to someone, felt good. Made up with my crush, had a good talk with him and he said sorry for not being there for me for the past few days. Had a video call with him as well.

After (1) and (2) I felt calmer, and after (3) I felt amazing.

WHY I TRY HARD NOT TO POST MY NUDES:

[I saw some of you suggesting me to post on Reddit with a throwaway account without my face on, or creating an OF account, or sending it to friends.]

Why I clearly avoid doing that: as weird as it may sound, I’m actually just trying to honor my idealistic principle of thinking that nudes = exclusive, I particularly take them for someone special and send them only to that particular person.

When I said I wanted to send nudes this morning I didn’t take anything new—I was about to send my old nudes from a few months ago. Which was taken for my crush.

In my previous experience, I had to send my nudes at least to 2 or 3 people not out of my will, I just kinda got “groomed” onto it or because I couldn’t clearly say no—only to regret it afterwards. Wasn’t even thinking of my own safety at the time, I was solely disappointed at how I “betrayed” my own principle (NOT betraying my crush, since I’m not yet exclusively in a committed relationship with him anyway). Yeah I’m idealistic AF.

And this I guess is my very first time, for whatever reason (seeking validation? Wanting some tension? Not sure, I guess the first one) I want to share my nudes when (presumably) I’m about to enter my hypomanic episode (in my previous hypomanic episode I was about to fuck random ass dudes, thank god I canceled the plan). And that’s why I was very confused, by my brain was still alerted that I shouldn’t be doing that at all.

So yeah. Sorry for the long ass update. Thank you for some of the nice and supportive DMs — had read some of them, but I no longer have the energy to reply for today.

"is it OK for a father to slap his
daughter's ass as a joke?",80,0.84,1708886926.0,"I'm a 20 years old only child, and my father has always been like this. I remember he'd try to kiss me on the lips when I was 7-10. When I got older, I began refusing because I understood that it's not a normal thing that fathers do with their daughters. He's also touched me inappropriately a lot of times. Every single day, he wants a hug and a kiss and gets mad at me whenever I refuse. He also keeps asking me to sit on his lap. 

It makes me extremely uncomfortable. Is it normal, or am I just overreacting as he claims? He says that it's him being ""affectionate."" 

He'd also sexually assaulted me by, it's so disgusting that I don't even wanna type it out, but, licking my nipples when i was 8 and asking me to touch his yk what. My grandfather - his father - has also done this to me, but I stopped seeing him after I turned 10. He even almost forced me to touch him in the middle of the street until I screamed and he let go of me. Neither of them knows what the other one did, but I guess it does come by genes.

My parents divorced when I was around 10-12, but it wasn't for this reason.

Why does this happen to me? Why couldn't I have a normal family? Now I'm 20, I've never had a boyfriend because talking to guys makes me uncomfortable and every single time a guy is acting nice towards me my daddy issues start acting up and I feel like he's trying to get something from me. I'm so desperate for a relationship at this point, but I'm also too scared to commit to one. 

And the worst thing is that even tho he's done unspeakable things to me, I still want to give him a chance and forgive him. He wasn't a bad father besides being a pedophile. And I hate myself for it, but I just want my dad to be my dad. It's not a surprise if i confess that i feel attracted towards older men than guys my age, and it disgusts me. I keep searching for a father figure in every single man that I meet. Whether it's my teacher or a bus driver. But deep down, I know that the only man a girl could trust with her life is her father.

Broken man biking across Canada-Update,76,0.99,1686502209.0,"Quick who am I. 
I am a 320lb man suffering from severe depression and other mental/physical issues and a month ago I decided to jump on my bike and pedal my ass across the Country. Well, almost across. Moncton NB to Vancouver. 

I'm unsure how to link previous posts maybe someone could be so kind to do that for me in the comments? Or just go to my profile if you're interested in reading more. 


***TRIGGER WARNING***
These updates are raw and real and I talk openly about my struggles with depression but also how Cycling effects those struggles. 


What is a 40lb update you may ask? It's the amount of weight I have lost in 4 weeks. 

When I left Moncton I was 320. I weighed myself yesterday and was 279. 

My jaw dropped. I knew I lost weight, I could see it and feel it. But forty fucking pounds?? 

I was with a host, my first host on this trip and he and his wife were so kind and so accommodating, I truly will remember them both for the rest of my days. It humbles me and as he seen first hand, I'm a very emotional dude. Depression has broken me, but their kindness broke me too and what they did for me will only fuel the fire that under me right now. 

But 40lbs!!! 

When I set out to do this the goal, as you may all remember, was to end up in BC a different and a better man.  A strong man both in body and mind and I can see and feel the changes now just a month in. 

There was a moment when I thought this was having zero positive effect on my mental health, but I was wrong. Everything that could go wrong had gone wrong and yet I still wake up each morning and head west. The other day I found out my EI claim was denied, I went into the bush and sat there thinking this was it. I formulated a plan in my head. Simple, quick, painless. Like I've thought about a million times, except this time for the first time the darkness passed in minutes and not hours or days. 

Imagine being in a dark room, it's pitch black, scary and noisy. Usually after hours or days i just find myself standing outside that room. I don't know I got there but I'm there. Outside the darkness and the noise and I carry on with my day. 

This time was different. As I was sitting there in that dark room the noise was being drown out by thoughts of and the feelings of energy and enthusiasm and excitement. I cannot explain why or how this happened, it's never happened to me before, but I found myself in my head with my thoughts being able to feel the positivity and, well, the light. 

I was outside of that dark room but after minutes and not only did I find myself outside of the room I was running from it, the energy I felt was like poitive emotions at war with the dark and destroying them so fast. 

I called my sister and told her I'm continuing, this can still happen. The world is changing around me, I am changing. I can do this. 


It feels like I should not be surprised by this but since that day the world has given me my two new friends in Ottawa who filled my bags with food (my gracious hosts) its given me a new supporter who just so happens to work with MEC (huge outdoor supply store in Canada) and had offered to help with gear, bike repairs, solar charger, ect. across Canada and has continued to give me an amazingly supportive community via reddit and Insta who message and share and even donate. 

This trip is me getting my self in order, becoming a better man so I can then advocate for other Wards of the Court who are like me, broken and lost. 

This journey has shown me that despite the darkness the world brings, there's always light around that corner and all I have to do is keep pedaling. 

There are days I don't want to, but I have to. Too much is at stake. 

I'm hitting Ontario today. This is when the real long slog starts. 4-6 weeks before I get to the other side. I'm taking the #11 all the way to the #1 going to put my head down and just pedal. 

Pedaling through adversity.

Struggling with Depression? Don't Forget About Your Dental Health!,75,0.98,1689681601.0,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share a reminder about the importance of taking care of your dental health, especially if you're dealing with depression. I know firsthand how easy it is to neglect our oral hygiene when we're feeling down, but trust me, it can have serious consequences.



For years, my depression kept me from properly caring for my teeth. I often relied on sugary snacks or even recreational drugs to cope, which only worsened the situation. Yesterday, I finally went to the dentist after 6 long years, and I was shocked to find out that I have significant gum disease. I could potentially lose my teeth, and the dental fees will take me at least a year to pay off.



If you're reading this and realizing that it's been a while since your last dental visit, and if you have the means to afford a checkup, I urge you to go. Dentists are there to help, and they won't judge you. Trust me, they've seen it all. Taking care of your oral hygiene now can save you from expensive dental procedures and years of pain in the future.



I understand that not everyone can afford dental care, and I apologize for not acknowledging this privilege in my initial post.

Why I’ll never cry in front of a women again…,74,0.85,1691454229.0,"When I was around the age of 13-15 I was going to a middle school event on a Friday night, where there would be a whole bunch of fun activities to do. 
On the way there my mom was driving me and as we got there she decided to tell me that my uncle had actually committed suicide a few weeks ago. Hearing that he passed almost a whole month ago and not being told this really made my heart sink to the bottom of my stomach and the only thing I could respond with was “oh”

Anyways after I was dropped off I was obviously completely confused and upset about the whole situation but I tried to keep myself calm and collected, and went to go find my friends to go hang out with.
Everything was going fine at first, I was distracted by my friends and all of the fun games and activities to do there so it was overall pretty fun.

There was a lazar tag inside of the gym in our school so there was a giant line of people who were waiting to play and me and my big group of friends decided to wait the long line, as time goes on we get to the front of the line but I didn’t realize that I was going to be the only one left out because there were already a few people in front of us that got in before we did and I had to be left out, so I waited for them to get back and I went and sat on the stairs.

As I was left alone with my thoughts I started remembering about my uncle who I had suddenly been informed had committed suicide and I was on the verge of tears so I was trying to hide my face in my knees. 
As I was sitting there with my head down a group of 3 girls had noticed me and came to talk to me (after 10 minutes of me sitting there without anyone talking to me)

Anyways they decided to come up to me and ask if I was okay and for some reason hearing those words just made me absolutely break down into tears and I just sobbed into my knees. I tried to speak up but I was choking up on my own tears which made the one to talk to me look confused.
The worse part about this is when I was trying to breathe but I was hyperventilating and they straight up just gave me the cold shoulder and walked away. 
How could you ask someone if their okay and see they are obviously not doing okay and then just leave them there without trying to talk to them?

My sisters mental illness is destroying my home life,72,0.98,1690941661.0,"I never post my first time visiting a sub, but I would truly appreciate some genuine kindness and feedback from people. My sister’s mental illness is tearing my family apart and I don’t know what to do. 

Also, just as a disclaimer, as her only brother/sibling, I obviously do care for my sister very much, but she makes it difficult to maintain any kind of positive relationship. I am in no way on here to drag her, and will not be using her name. 

My sister, who is 34 now (4 years older than me), has suffered mental health issues since she was a teenager, but it came to a head her senior year of college. She had a manic episode on Thanksgiving Day of 2010, left campus, passed out on the side of the highway, and wound up in the hands of the highway patrol. I’m still super thankful she had the wherewithal to call them/anyone herself, I hate to think of what could have happened. The details are still pretty sketchy, but are not the important factor. She was never the same, and was almost totally incoherent for a solid month after in the psych ward. She has basically been in and out of psych wards around the state at least 2-4 times a year in the ensuing 13 years since. The original diagnosis was some sort of medical gray area schizo-effective bipolar disorder, but I believe it has evolved into borderline personality disorder. 

She ended up leaving her career over it, and is now disabled. Every year that passes since she started getting her disability checks, her health has gotten steadily worse. On top of the issues I’ve stated, she’s also severely overweight and diabetic, can’t handle her own finances, has had a bunch of issues with her thyroid, and her meds either completely sedate her or throw her into a non stop mania, and she is incapable of functioning for days/weeks at times because of it. 

My parents were totally unprepared for all of this. My sister was an honors student, had all kinds of accomplishments to be proud of in high school, and sort of seemed to have her life planned out when she started college. I know no one does, but no parent is ever ready for something like this to happen, it was and is still pretty traumatic.

My folks still look after her (she has never been able to live on her own) and she puts us all through the wringer daily. I moved back home 2 years ago when I was on some truly hard times. At first it was fine, and I learned to be patient with her. Now her attitude has become so vindictive to the point she assumes we all hate her, and that our own mother has a vendetta out to screw her over. She’s completely delusional about this, and I’ve had some arguments with her over it when my temper boils over. I’m not going to let anyone cuss out either of our parents (in front of me AND them). Our mother is her power of attorney and controls most of her savings at this point. It’s just the way my sis talks about her, you’d think our mother beat the hell out of us as kids or something, it’s some truly nasty shit she says. 

She is struggling now more than I think she ever has, her mania and mood swings are so bad that she’s delusional and angry all the time, every day. It’s getting very hard to keep being patient, and to stay at home through all of this. My parents and I have all agreed that this behavior is making us all miserable and sort of codependent with her suffering. Sister is making all of our home lives very chaotic. I get to hear her screaming or sobbing at the top of her lungs nearly every day, usually directed at me or whoever is home. And I’m not sure she even realizes it or cares how she’s affecting us. In turn it is making me callous to her entire condition. It’s hard enough to even be at home witnessing her being this disrespectful. This means if I’m not working 50-60+ hours a week, I am at home arguing with what’s left of my only sibling and watching her life fall deeper into the shitter. 

Sister is supposed to receive a deal on affordable housing very soon, but we all of course seriously doubt that she will be able to take care of herself. None of us know what to do. We assume she will move out and be back home again within a few months and in even worse shape. And it especially wears down my retired father, who she has been truly awful to in the past few months. 

I guess the point I’m getting at is that I can’t figure out what to do now. I feel like if I move out, I completely waste my opportunity to save loads of cash so that I can buy a home. I have begun saving, and it is quite possible by next spring if I keep working and saving. But if I stay, I also have to keep dealing with this... I think it’s fair to say she will never be “cured,” and that the best she can hope for is that it gets more manageable. That also seems unlikely. 

I went back to online therapy recently, and am considering going back to my old in-person therapist to work out some of these issues and other personal problems I’ve had over the past few years. My sis and my parents have also totally rejected going to family/group therapy whenever I bring it up.

In the past couple of years, I’ve completely changed certain parts of my life.  I’ve cut out porn, video games, bad food, alcohol, and recently - even sugar.

Something that doesn’t help my situation is I don’t like myself.  I don’t like that I have essential tremors (shakiness) in my hands.  I don’t like that I have some acne on my neck and back.  I don’t like that my personality is not the type that’s the “life of the party” for lack of a better word.  I don’t like that I have some redness in my eyes unless I use special eye drops.

I thought by cutting all of that out, routinely working out, and dressing better - that girls would approach me or show cues that they’re interested in me.

It is fucking hard to swallow the idea that nothing will change unless you basically start immersing yourself in your fears.

"I am not proud of my job, ashamed even, I feel like 'less' of a person, and possibly for no reason. How could I get out of this?",70,1.0,1689166227.0,"Hi all.

All of my life I had ambition, I wanted to be an artist in video games, I got there but it wasn't quite right. But it was still awesome. It was awesome for 2 years until I was made redundant in the recession. Since then I needed a job, any job, and I landed a job as an artworker. (for artworker think of graphic design, but the difference between a chef and a cook as being the difference between an artworker and a designer)

I like it well enough but all I do is practical problem solve, I don't do anything creative, I do the practical side of the business. So we have a logo that has been updated, it is now my job to get it updated on 10,000 documents. It is challenging sometimes but most of the time I feel like a factory worker. 

The thing is, many would love my job, many would like the simplicity of just doing practical work not creative stuff. 

But I feel ashamed of it. Like I wanted to be an artist, but now I just push buttons, noting unique or creative. Not many designers could do what I do because it would bore them, and they wouldn't think analytically enough to do this kind of work. But they still think they are superior (and have shown it).

A new job sounds like it is the way to go but I have no idea what togo into, and I earn 30k which is kind of where the cut off is, I could be a designer and earn no more. So my wage isn't even bad (no great in a cost of living crisis, but not bad either).

I just don't feel right?

I got divorced last year and it messed my head up, I am so envious of friends who are in the military but I am 35...I can't do that. And I gave up my chance because my ex didn't want me to do it. 

&#x200B;

I just don't like what I do, I feel embarrassed by it. Im not a designer or an artist I am more like a technician at best. I feel like I have up opportunities to do other things because others didnt want em to do that and I put others first naturally. 

It has gotten to a point where I sort of don't even want to open my eyes in the morning. I am ok once i am moving more or less but in the mornings i am bad. On m drive to work today I fleetingly imagined just turning the wheel and going off the side of the road. Just because it would put an end to this monotony. 

I don't want this to be my legacy...making forms for clients...but I don't want to jump just because the grass may be greener. 

I just feel lost. And ever since the divorce I have been feeling worse and worse.

I'll never ever leave her, cause I love her unconditionally, she's the best girl in the world, and when she has good days, we laugh and talk and dream together,  I cherish those days so much. I love every aspect of her personality, and she has a huge heart, she's smart and beautiful.
But, I'm so, so tired. We have no support but each other. I help her, but who helps me? There are days I just want to give up, cause if I can't see her happy then what's the point?

I got fired because of my mental health,70,0.96,1692654003.0,"So I only worked at this job for a few months but never called out I have ADHD and depression but I still came in even if my depression was bad at the moment. This week someone very close to me had a stroke they already had a stroke a few weeks before that and I and the family believe they may not make it. I was really upset but I did work that day so I went in and tried to push through. I was able to do my job I just wasn’t as talkative with customers (I worked in retail) so the next day I was supposed to work I had a mental breakdown it was bad it was a mix of that situation, financial situations, my relationship, my best friend leaving for basic training, etc and I was just so overwhelmed I had a breakdown I was balling on the floor I was hyperventilating I couldn’t breathe my bf told me he will call them and inform them of the situation and that I cannot speak due to this. He gave them a call and told them I was having a breakdown I cannot speak on the phone and that I am in no condition to work today this was 7 hours before my shift (when I have these breakdowns they last at least the entire day but it's very rare when these things happen I usually can hold my composure) so he got off the phone and said ok so what I’m gonna say may upset you and I’m very sorry and I knew immediately. He said that they said “Is this like a long-term thing because we need workers who aren’t you know. that. so we are gonna end her employment because we need employees who can give their best attitudes and show up to work if she wants to apply in 6 months she can but she has to be happy and healthy” I was just flabbergasted I didn’t even know what to say this was the first and only time I called in. The store wasn’t short staffed and there were 2 other closers there so I already had coverage and since it was Night Shift it was gonna be very slow. I just am not sure what to even think about this.


Edit: when I said this week I meant last week I forgot today was Monday this whole thing happened yesterday on Sunday I apologize for that

Another edit: thank you all very much for your advice I read all of it and took it all into serious consideration. For those saying my bf should have just said I was sick you are all right. I do believe he was in a panic due to the state I was in I actually showed him all of the comments and he agreed if anything like this ever happens again at another job I will just say I am sick and then I’ll explain my reason IF they ask I don’t like to lie about why I am calling out I’ve always been an honest person but seeing some of these comments made me realize that sometimes you gotta just say “I got the flu” or something I actually will talk to my bf because we do live together if we should take legal advice or honestly just leave it as it is luckily because we do have rent so I have to work my bf messaged his boss if they could hire me at his job and they scheduled me for an interview tomorrow so hopefully it goes well. I was told by him we cannot work the same shifts due to the risk of us breaking up and causing drama in his work environment which is perfectly fine with me. If things do get as bad as it was on Sunday I will look into FMLA I believe one of you mentioned that.

Is it normal to conclude life at 30?,69,0.99,1690415776.0,"I'm 27, I'm from London UK, I work a job that goes against my personality, I have maybe 2 friends at most, I have never had a girlfriend for the entirety of my life & I don't think I ever will. Growing up I was never diagnosed for my mental health but I'm convinced I'm on the spectrum for autism due to the fact I've dealt with Body Dysmorphic Disorder since as early as age 4 & used maladaptive daydreaming as a coping mechanism to this day. Safe to say my reality is not meeting up the standards, I feel like I've plateaued in life when it comes to improving my mental health. 

I'm turning 28 in November & I have never left the country once, never really enjoyed my 20s due to the fact i can't adjust to social cues. Everything feels forced with me, I used to think I was ugly growing up & I relentlessly focused all my energy on improving my physical appearance. Safe to say now I think im handsome due to the change of reception I get from women but I still don't believe it due to how I was treated by them when I was younger (PTSD perhaps?)... The breaking point for me now is knowing my Mum may never see me have a child at this rate, she is ill & currently disabled in her mid 50s. It breaks my heart all the time knowing she wants to see her grandchild & I also want this but I've always hated myself so much to the point I could never comprehend letting a woman into my life. I feel like I can offer physical attraction, mental wisdom & a reassuring outlook on actual relationships despite never being in one. But outside that, I work an average job, I've got no friends, I'm a virgin, I can't drive & I'm limited on what enjoyment I can actively bring to a woman due to the fact I've never experienced much in my life. This itself has recently stopped me going for a woman I really admire even though she is also going through her own grievances. 

I've always told myself if I just had a taste of what life a normal person gets to enjoy, I'd be way better but I'm yet to come close to those necessities.  I'm inclined to end my life at 30 if I'm yet to develop & change. I can be the wisest in the shed, without experience I have no proof for my brain to validate a fixated behaviour pattern of normal functional living. I am saddened at the idea to hurt my mother further by ending my life at 30 if I'm to be in the same boat but something in me can't accept how people have it easy in life & I don't even have the basic privileges to even live life.

I feel trapped & I feel burdened by my brain, I'm tired of rationalising all the time. Tired of relying on dopamine from content or being reliant on endorphin release from the gym to feel positive. I'm putting a positive front but deep down I'm dying inside. People can say it's ""depression"", but like I said if I haven't experienced anything my brain has no proof to feel validated, for example it's like labeling someone for laughing because they got tickled. Granted the circumstances I'm in, feeling the way I do is a reasonable byproduct and the fact I persevered with low self esteem for my entire life, it shows I'm far from just dwelling over the idea of depression.  

All I can say is, I'll be taking it to the next level  but I'll be open about my experience. If this doesn't work then nothing will work for me. God knows how many people I've let slipped out my life simply because I felt I wasn't good enough and some of them may have even loved me.",mentalhealth,RobinAndBeastboy,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15am1c3/is_it_normal_to_conclude_life_at_30/,38,69.6969696969697,0.6969696969697026,0.000149608938496611

Why is suicide wrong?,68,0.85,1704825007.0,"Just a disclaimer, I'm not suicidal. I sometimes have suicidal thoughts, but I would never act on them.  
  
So I have severe social anxiety and I find it extremely difficult to relate or fit in with anyone. I oftentimes feel like I'm only doing things just because I want to have friends and fit in with a certain group of people, and it makes me confused about my identity; who I really am, what I value, what I like or don't like, etc. It's like a self-imposed peer pressure. Everything I do, I'm always asking myself, ""Why do I want to do this? Who am I doing this for?""  
  
For example, I got my first (ear) piercing last year and told my therapist at the time about it. At first, she was concerned that I did it because I felt like I needed to in order to fit in. I told her that I actually wanted to and that it was something I was thinking about doing for a whille. She said it was fine as long as I wanted to do it.  
  
So how is suicide different? Why is it wrong? If you genuinely wanted to kill yourself, why shouldn't you do it? What if you just don't want to be alive? What if you just hate it? People always say, ""Do what YOU want to do,"" but why shouldn't I kill myself? Shouldn't I be doing what I want to do? It's my life and my choice, so how does anyone have the right to tell me no, it's wrong? If I wanted to kill myself, why shouldn't I be allowed to do it?  
  
If people have the freedom to do anything they want with their life and they decide that this is something they genuinely want to do, why is it always frowned upon? ""No you shouldn't do it. Your family will hurt. It's selfish."" Well, it's MY life and MY choice. If I didn't want to be here anymore, then I think it would be selfish of others to try to convince me and force me to keep me here. If someone is genuinely suffering and they just genuinely wanted to leave, how is it not selfish for others to tell them otherwise? What gives them the right to take that choice away from them? If someone wanted to walk into a clinic that offers assisted suicide, why shouldn't they be allowed to do it? Why aren't people given the freedom to choose whether they want to live or die?

PLEASE HELP! I am mentally disabled snd my mental health care and medications have been taken away with no warning for no reason. What do I do?,65,0.92,1686048451.0,"Hi! I really need your help in figuring out what to do in this situation. First off, I am disabled because of a myriad of mental health disorders. OCD, CHRONIC PTSD, GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER, BIPOLAR DISORDER, PANIC DISORDER, and ADHD. 
I am a patient at a telehealth corporation called Eleanor Health. I had been seeing the most amazing, kind, compassionate,and caring psychiatriast I have ever met in my life for since December. She was also giving me DBT therapy.I was rapidly improving and on a path to a great place mentally, until it was all taken away. 
About three weeks ago my appointments with her started to be postponed. I was instead scheduled with a nurse practitoner who had no knowledge of mental health care whatsoever. There was no explation of why I could not see my doctor. My medications were being shuffled around, or threatened to be taken away. This past month has been one of the most stressful months of my life not knowing what was going on. 
They finally put me on the schedule with my doctor June 1st. I had no idea that this would be the last time I was allowed to see her. She was very heavy hearted as well, and it seems as if someone above her was causing this. She also had me on adderall for ADHD and this was taken away without warning. This was also not her decision.
She told me I needed to get my medical records because she had taken careful notes regarding our sessions together, and my marked imorovement with the therapy, adderall, and other medications.
I am now in limbo. Going thru heavy adderall withdrawl.

I don't know where to begin, or even why i'm making this post. I just can't sleep and need somewhere to get my thoughts out.

I will start by saying he wasn't just my ""step dad"", he was my father. The man I remember growing up with, looking up to and seeking hard advice from.

My last goodbye was over the phone, I slept for most of that day in denial or.. something. I saw him afew times before that in the hospital, told him I love him, how much he means to me, things I never got to express. But it was only during that phone call when I felt my heart spill for him..

Then he passed that night. And i'm stuck with the wish that I just really said everything he means to me, to him, face to face.

That being said, he was a man who understood, without the need for something to be said. I know inside he knew how much I care, how much he loved me as one of his own. The pain is wishing I spent more time with him, talking, sharing, laughing. My own mental health always got in the way of that. 

I cannot express how much I love him for understanding that, knowing there was so much I wanted to say to him but couldn't find the words for. He just knew I loved him so much.

He died surrounded by my unbelievably loving mother, his parents, and his sister. Im glad to say he was a man with absolutely no regrets and filled the lives of all his family and friends with love, care, and understanding. I love you, Chris.

URGENT HELP NEEDED. Kept my friend from suicide for the last 6 years - I don't know how to stop him anymore.,64,0.97,1706480819.0,"I'm super stressed right now and I've been feeling sick for a long while today. Help me.

My friend and I are both turning 17 on February 6. Because of our joint birthday, I see him as the similarly-aged brother I never got. He lives in Australia whilst I live in Norway - yet it has never kept us apart.

We both struggle mentally, but he's on an entirely different level. Having been sexually assaulted at a young age, a manipulative, severely mentally ill mother, abusive relationships within the family, being involved with drugs and then being the one who has to fix it all for his messy family; he's understandably tired and has threatened suicide for every single year that I've known him for.

I've always promised to get him out of there when we turned 18. Whenever he was having a manic episode or just being unwell in general, I told him that giving up now isn't worth it considering all of the years he's been dealing with this - yet we're just one year away from breaking off the chains. He has always believed me.

But today I got the unfortunate news that his mother wandered off and overdosed on valium. The valium HE was prescribed for HIS mental health issues. I'm so pissed about it. According to the doctors, she's not well and she might die. This is worse than anything he has ever endured and it was the last thing we needed right now. I've send him messages wishing him well, saying that I hope he's okay and that he can vent as much as he wants to me. No response.

I don't know if any of them are alive right now but I fucking pray to God that at the very least he's alive. I love him so much, more than words can describe. I'm shaking so much yet I can't cry cause this is not an unique situation.

I don't wanna say it but.. *If* he comes back to tell me what's up, what can I say to make him feel better? I'm exhausted. I'm the only actual family he has but I'm not well off mentally myself and I don't know what else to say. Please please help. I can't lose him.

My best friend died suddenly,65,0.98,1697210487.0,"Hey everyone,

It's been 9 days since I received a call from my nephew (my best friends eldist) telling me that his Dad was dead. Luckily, my girlfriend was helping me pack as I'm moving from Colorado to Georgia to go live with her. So she was physically there for support for that. Since then, I've just not cared about anything except the waves of physical pain I feel when remembering that my friend is gone. My job is quite demanding and we are at a point where my position might be eliminated because things just aren't working.

All I want is my friend back. I know that's not possible but it's all my mind and body are screaming for. I don't understand the purpose of any of this shit. The entire world appears to be completely fucked and I've found it incredibly difficult to see the point of even trying anymore. I've made great leaps and bounds in my life with growth from where I started to where I am now but I fear the cost of this just might not be worth it anymore. I need physical separation from the bullshit going on but every time I turn my head, it's right in my face again. I'm at my wits end.

I spent years dealing with panic attacks and debilitating anxiety but haven’t had one in 7 years. Here’s what I learned through self-healing without medication. I hope it’s helpful to others.,61,0.91,1685513980.0,"•	Anxiety and panic attacks were something I was experiencing, not something that I “had”. Letting go of the idea that this was a disorder or something I had to deal with for life was really important.

•	Meditation in the beginning felt impossible because my Nervous System was so disregulated that my mind and body didn’t feel safe when I gave it space to heal. Persisting was the single best thing I ever did for myself.

•	I didn’t have any self-love or self-care. I realised I didn’t know how to say no to people or things. I was constantly busy and exhausted. I would make myself available to others when deep down it didn’t suit me. Starting to say no was really hard at first but it has been the second best thing I have ever done for myself.

•	I realised I had been operating from my head and was virtually cut off from my body. I could label my emotions mentally but was never actually FEELING those emotions. Meditating allowed me to start feeling safe in my body for the first time in probably 20 years. It also helped me to become more deeply connected to myself, life and other people. My relationships have been so fulfilling and nourishing as a result.

•	I realised how long I had been living in a state of survival and how much of that resulted from childhood trauma. Instead of running from it, I began to deal with the experiences I had growing up and the reality of what that had meant for me. I could then make different choices that truly supported me instead of doing things that kept inducing anxiety and stress.

•	Accepting the reality for things as they are instead of how I wanted them to be was important. The longer I denied my own reality, the worse I continued to feel. Trying to hold on to the stories of what I wanted was far more painful than being honest about how they actually are.

•	Drugs & alcohol had been a way to feel good and confident in the moment but always intensified the anxiety and panic attacks. When I began to calm my Nervous System and stopped living in survival mode 24/7, I felt connected and content within which naturally meant I didn’t feel an urge to do those things.

•	Caffeine helped me to deal with my lack of energy that resulted from never sleeping but it was always perpetuating the problem. The more I had, the more anxious I felt and the more often I had panic attacks. Learning how to put my self-care and needs first meant that I could finally do things for myself that I really needed to heal instead of quick fixes.

•	Anxiety still presents in my life but it is natural, healthy anxiety that comes and goes depending on what’s happening in my life. It is no longer debilitating anxiety and for that reason, I can learn from what it is telling me. I now have a healthy relationship with Anxiety rather than being terrified of it.

•	I have learned to always trust my intuition and gut feeling even though it feels incredibly scary at times to go against the story or conditioned thought.",mentalhealth,Constant-Fondant5454,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/13we8j3/i_spent_years_dealing_with_panic_attacks_and/,33,67.03296703296704,6.032967032967036,0.00014389048886463351

I apologize if this isn’t the place to post this. I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was literally 8 years old (I’m 24 now). After getting on meds and regularly going to therapy for the past 4 years my mental health has somewhat improved but even on my best mental health days I still feel like I’m going through the motions and there’s no real point to existing.

I am now 187lbs. The largest I have ever been. I have red stretch marks on my boobs, my thighs, the back of my legs, my fucking lady bits. It’s embarrassing. 

I hate that I’m like this, but I hate myself now. I don’t want to see family because I know they will talk about it. I don’t want to see my husband’s family because they’ll talk about it. I’m scared to go to the store because I feel like all anyone sees is my weight. I haven’t taken photos of myself in a long time. I used to stream, but quit because I couldn’t be on camera. 

I can’t stress this enough, I hate myself. I hate the way I look. I stopped having sex with my husband because of my weight gain. I’ve tried to lose weight but I physically can’t right now. I am always hungry and so tired. I think there may be something wrong with me because of how much I sleep. I sleep 13 hours a day. Doesn’t matter what time I go to bed, I will wake up at 1pm every day. 

None of my clothes fit me. I have to wear my husbands clothes. I recently bought sweatpants because that’s the only thing I’m comfortable in. 

I don’t know why I hate myself so much because of this. I have never thought badly about people who are overweight. I have never treated anyone differently for being overweight. I truly do not care if someone is overweight. But for some reason, I am disgusted with myself. 

I’m scared I will never be my old self again. It’s so hard to ignore the feeling that I’m hungry. I have a hard time exercising because my shins hurt and I get tired so, so fast.

Why am I being mean to my boyfriend?,62,0.76,1699369116.0,"My (25F) has a stomach bug, and since then I started being very mean to him. I already knew I had problems with these kind of things, it’s happened in the past with another boyfriend.

It’s like when someone (mostly a boyfriend) is sick with some virus, fever, etc I can’t stand the situation. I start being anxious, panicking and it makes me uncomfortable, and I project these feeling onto that person, being mean, irritable and mistreating him. This usually doesn’t happen if it’s some other type of illness  (like it doesn’t happen with a simple headache or something more serious). I’m also emetophobic.

We’re in a long distance relationship and I stopped replying to his messages for hours, I told him I didn’t want to hear from him, and when he told me he had a stomachache I replied in a very cold way. This obviously led to a big argument where I kept being petty. He just wanted support. My only point was to humiliate him, mock him and make him sad and suffering, even after the argument. I’m hating him. I’m freaking out.

I told him I’m not really myself right now but haven’t told him why. He understands. It would make me uncomfortable and vulnerable just talking about this with him. I know this isn’t right and I’m really ashamed of myself. I really love him and I feel sorry for him, for the fact that he’s sick and that he has to deal with someone like me. I usually am normal and really kind and loving. But I also have this part of me I can’t suppress. 

I just want to say I’m not like this, usually I’m a good and empathic person. But I know there’s something wrong with me. I have other types of behaviours that make me think that. I feel so bad.

A video game community made me depressed for over two years,62,0.91,1709766694.0,"

I wish this never happened to me, not even on my worst enemy.

When I was 15, I used to love a game called Sky, a game categorized as one of the nicest and most accepting communities out there on the internet, and people don’t usually get bad experiences there; but I did, and it was horrible. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to share the name because I was scared of more bullying, or people saying that I’m making this up, for not liking their community. That’s how stressed I was. 

I mainly played it for its musical mechanics, their piano. I used to play it so much that it was just the only thing that made me feel alive. Over time, I encountered many issues in the game so I wanted to rant about it in the community, not in a rude way. Issues with the game mechanics, and other things, like not wanting to be recorded without my consent when I play music. (It made many people there angry for some reason) I also tried proposing ideas to the developers of that game, to tweak a few things so that it’s easier for me to play, they said they’ll get back to that, but never did. 

But because to those certain people in that community, it was a ridiculous thing to be stressed over. So they ridiculed me, and called me names, and said some of the worst shit you can think of, because that’s what the internet does; a massive cesspool, a place where you can anything you want, and not get consequences. A few remaining people still tried to help but were mostly puzzled, but didn’t get why I was so upset over the issue. I wish I knew that before I posted. I didn’t realize at the time that this interaction would truly put a dent in me. 

That was over 3 years ago. For a long time I wanted them to apologize for what they did. To apologize that they hurt me, so much that not even words can even describe my hurt. 

Then I realized; no one cares, I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself, that no one actually cares. I’ve never felt so lonely, so isolated, dejected; it seemed as if no one else had my issues, which made me feel even more lonely, I then get angry and then I cry, and the cycle repeats. It wasnt fair; everyone else gets to be content with their games, while I get traumatized. I remember feeling hopeless for a long time. I wanted to disappear. I probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway, poof, gone in the wind, literally. Haha…….

I’m 18 now. I’m recovering, but recovery has been tough. I’m getting by day by day. I’m slowly accepting that some people are just assholes. And I just gotta move on, despite how painful it was for me. I’m choosing to do other better things in life for me. Hobbies like math, music (other instruments not related to sky), or art. It won’t resolve whatever happened but it suppresses my thoughts for a few hours, like alcohol but without the effects of being drunk. I cannot ever go to the past, and change what happened, what happened truly traumatized me, and I don’t think it’ll ever go away. 

I remember posting about this in this subreddit three years ago. it made me feel bad that no one replied, but wasn’t sure why it was like that. 

I miss my sky musical instrument. It might’ve even become my career choice, if that existed. ",mentalhealth,ConcertReady6788,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b8eev4/a_video_game_community_made_me_depressed_for_over/,39,68.13186813186813,6.131868131868131,0.00014624934933782423

There's no one I am comfortable sharing these emotions that even I, feel alienated from myself if thats even possible. 

I am ashamed of what I have become and I dont know how to tell my 10 year old self that no, it didnt get any better, it was just the beginning of my end. I was a good student, exemplary even, despite all the abuse Ive been through but as all stories of burnout go, I am now here in my undergraduate studies not able to graduate after seven years. I feel jealous of my peers who are now soaring in their careers while I'm here rotting in my bed typing this out of pity of myself.

It's not like I have completely given up on myself - I strive hard to make myself better, every single day. I work two jobs after my classes so I can eat at least once a day and fund my studies. But you know what, it just feels like I've been dealt with bad cards at the beginning making me destined to lose in life. Would I have been better if my father did not physically and emotionally hurt me? If I dont feel betrayed and abandoned by mother? If I actually have the resources to fund my interests and hone my craft? 

The worse part is I am actually quite vocal about not being mentally well. But it always feels like it's being downplayed into a joke. Or did I set myself up as a person not to be taken seriously? Idk. Is it the romanticization of depression among my peers that makes me want to burrow all these feelings to myself? Maybe. 

I don't know what to do anymore. The idea of dying  often dwells in my mind, in fact it hasn't left my mind since the time it has sprung in it. It has buried its roots deep in the crevices of my tiny brain.  I might do it and I think I can. But I dont want to for the sake of people I care for. I dread the day that I would be brave enough to do it for myself and not for others.

"My life crashed down around me, how can I rebuild after deep trauma?",58,1.0,1692493831.0,"Hey everyone, I am hoping that by coming here I can find some insight into how to pull myself out of this rut I found myself in.  
  
As a back story, I was married, I have three kids, I was the executive director of a non profit in a big city, I had a large social circle, friends and things to do, and I was quite happy and content with my life. I wasn't wealthy, but I was happy and thats all the monetary gain I needed. Fast forward to 5 years ago, my spouse grew bored and started doing some off the wall things like spending days or weeks away from the home with me having to figure out how to work and take care of the kids. Eventually I found out she was dating another man and asked her to work to resolve it with me or leave. She chose to leave.  
  
I held onto the non profit for a year before finally giving it up, but my mental health has been horrid with no little improvement over the last four years. I have been in 5 relationships in that time, all failed and I blame myself. I am not mentally capable of facilitating a romantic relationship in a healthy way, so I realized I need to just step back and work on myself which is why I'm here.  
  
I have a regular job now, I work a 9-5 which is nice because there is structure. I am not longer disciplined enough to run my own schedule. Perhaps there is just no motivation. I have almost no social circle and for some reason blame my looks. I may not be the prettiest man, but people liked me back then   
I don't understand why they'd have a problem with me now. I go to work and struggle to carry a conversation. I often find myself trying to escape the conversation while at the same time craving the interaction. It's weird. I want to have friends, I want to talk to people, but a friend will call and I avoid the call, I don't pick up.   
  
I forced myself to go to karaoke last night at a local bar and invited some of my friends. Every single one declined. So I sat there by myself wondering what was wrong with me.  
  
I don't believe in myself at all and I think that is the core of the issue. I see myself as a failure. I think people are judging my ugly face and don't want to be friends with me. I feel like a loser. I feel completely alone. I don't get out much because I have my three kids (7, 13, and 14 yo) full time. I want to rekindle my friendships with my old friends but I reach out and they don't seem interested or they don't message me back at all. I want to try and make new friends, but the thought of creating something new terrifies me.   
  
I want to return to the social creature I used to be. I want to be able to carry a conversation and build a deep relationship with ANYONE, even just one person, but I can't. I'm crippled by fear. I get up and leave when someone comes into the break room and it's just us two. I live in this nightmare that I Want to be close to someone, but can't.  
  
How do I rebuild confidence? How can I once again believe in myself? Has anyone experienced this, what can I do?  
  
TLDR:  
My life fell apart when my wife left me and my kids four years ago, and my social life and self confidence have been in shambles and I'm trying to rebuild but don't know where to start and am asking for help from this community to help me get back on my feet and be able to at least carry a conversation without feeling like I'm not worth someone else's time.

"Found out from my new therapist, that my old therapist who abandoned me said she won’t ever work with me again, despite telling me in our final session “that the door was open down the road” for it",55,0.9,1690045911.0,"Last time I updated on this:

My new therapist had me sign an ROI because she wanted to coordinate care with her and find out the whole picture of the termination.

Firstly I found out that my therapist made the decision to terminate me, and subsequent decision to withdraw being willing to ever work with me again, because her supervisors told her she had to (to “protect her license”, which makes it sound like she/the supervisors are throwing me and my well-being under the bus to cover their ass professionally.)

But yeah that’s what my old therapist told my new one when they spoke on the phone.


That was honestly the last thing I was hanging on for. I have no hope. This was the last straw, I’ve been abandoned so many times by so many people that I’ve been close to. My old therapist used to say that “she was the exception” as proof that not literally everyone would hurt and abandon me, but now there’s literally none. There’s never been one exception, not one person in my life, who ended up not abandoning me.

I don’t know what to do. I’m in shock. I was already in shock and disbelief that this was all happening to begin with.

But I had a scrap of hope that this wound could be healed if I got a chance to work with her again and resolve it with her.

The new therapist is okay, but not nearly as understanding or just doesn’t intuitively “get me” the way the old one did.

I have no hope anymore. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I can’t take this.

"Parents forced me to wear diapers and only one set of clothes for school year, now my life is a mess, how do I fix and get past?",59,0.98,1687257298.0,"For context. I was adopted and my foster parents were brand new to parenting. They eventually adopted me. I was very rebellious but also suffering from super traumatic early childhood events, such as getting sexually assaulted and raped by previous foster parents that were men, sexually assaulted by step siblings and mother. Fast forward to 8th grade, I was hitting puberty, and very rebellious. My adoptive parents decided to ""teach me a lesson"" and took away all clothes, underwear, shoes, door off hinges, any sort of privacy whatsoever. I had to shower with cold showers because I was ungrateful"" aka water heater was turned off when I went to take a shower. My parents then gave me a ragged set of Vans, a Karate shirt that I had received from a previous Karate class that year, one pair of underwear, one pair of socks, and one set of shorts. I had to have this set of clothes for the entire year to PROVE that I was grateful to get back my privileges as they said. So no lying, no cheating in school, no ducking around personal questions, etc. I feel like this life event set off a massive traumatic event. I was bullied relentlessly for wearing the same clothes day in and day out, appearing in yearbook photos, activities, sports, etc with the same outfit. I was asked if I stunk like shit because I wore the same thing, if I asked to wear the same thing, if I was only allowed to have one set of clothes. It made me ashamed. I started becoming anorexic, bulimic, staying in the bathroom during lunch and recess, purging after meals at home. Became depressed (I was diagnosed with depression after this event whereas before I never had depression, I was a very happy kid.) I didn't want it getting out that the people who took me in were treating me like this but I was convinced I deserved it because I was such a bad rebellious kid.

This life event has led all the way to now. I can't be photographed wearing the same thing. I can't wear any article more than one day in a row. I have spent thousands of dollars on clothes, perfumes, colognes, shoes, socks, underwear, you name it clothing wise or accessory wise for a male, I've had it it every color, pattern, etc. Some days I have multiple outfit changes because I have the creeping feeling that I've worn it before and it either gets thrown away or pushed into the closet to wear a different day. I hundreds of perfumes and colognes, lotions, anything to make ""the smell"". It's a phantom feeling or smell I get wear I think that I smell really bad and have to cover it up. I will stop whatever I am doing, and excuse myself to put on lotion, cologne, body spray, perfume. Anything because its been drilled into my head that I think someone will comment on my appearance and I want to be prepared.

Was what my parents did abuse? Or were they just being normal parents? When I talk to people about this situation, they chalk it up to them being new parents. Even my parents continually tell me I'm being dramatic and my version of events was nothing like what really happened. They said they got the idea from a church friend.

Another reason why I wear multiple sets of underwear per day is because my parents forced me to wear diapers during high school and threatened to tell my school, and class. They let my teachers know that I was wearing diapers if anyone asked. I was a bedwetter due to being raped and abused and my parents had no idea I was SA'ed. So they kept telling me I was lazy and that I didn't want to go to the bathroom. 

I can't seem to work past these events. I still have hundreds and hundreds of clothes, perfumes, colognes, anything to mask. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos of minimalism and minimalist clothing and it gives me panic attacks to think of someone else wearing the same thing or something that has one shade (one man wears same black shirt, black jeans or blue jeans) it's the ONLY thing he says he has in his closet. His videos pop up and I usually have a meltdown because it freaks me out when I least expect it.

I don't understand why they have it organized in the way that they do. I have to hide everything in my head from everybody just so I'm not thrown into a hospital and locked up like a prisoner, all the while having to worry about constant therapy and possible assault. You can't and really shouldn't force therapy on anyone, yet they do it anyways. None of these thoughts are organized because I just got fed-up with bottling my emotions so I'm not treated like a maniac, and I'm sorry about it. I just wish I could talk to someone without being locked away and forced into therapy, but I know that I'll inevitably get thrown into one. I'm going to a counselor soon, and I'm going to try and be entirely honest with her. With all the suicidal and self-harming thoughts that I've had, I'll be going to a psych ward in no time.

&#x200B;

Like it just feels so backwards. ""Oh, you're traumatized and feel alone? Let's throw you into what is essentially a prison and treat you like a borderline insane, unhuman freak. All the while, other potentially dangerous people can do anything and likely get away unpunished."" I may be overexaggerating, but Imo it's just disgusting and stupid.

How they speak, Them complaining, I'm just getting tired of everybody, and it's not like that was a common thing for me to do, I'm quite extroverted and it's basically a 180 flip in personality, I started watching gore out of curiosity, I never looked at the popular ""infamous"" stuff but I did see a few of them, like Gary Plauche, Ronnie McNutt but that was basically it until more recently where I saw the definite most infamous ones like funkytown, split faced diver. A few days I looked back on them and I realise, I'm not doing this from my curiosity anymore, I genuinely enjoy this shit and I can't see the people in the videos as real people, I just can't feel empathy for them.

My boyfriend (38M) feels guilty every time we are intimate. He feels like I (32F) am too young for him.,54,0.94,1700434796.0,"My boyfriend and I haven't been together long, only a month. He's been struggling to keep an erection when we are physically together and often loses it if things progress to sex, which we haven't had btw. He has shared that medically it's not a problem, because he has masturbated alone to orgasm.

He told me that he's never dated anything younger than him, only his age and older, and has difficulty wrapping his head around sleeping with a ""younger"" woman.
After a recent heart to heart I learned that he was molested as a child by two different men, one was a religious leader, and the other was an older neighbor. So maybe being with someone younger than him puts him back into this raw state of vulnerability that he has yet to unravel and heal. I brought up therapy and he shut it down right away. And I get it, this is uncomfortable to sit with.

He says he desires me and is so attracted to me, but once the guilt hits, he just can't seem to turn it off and he loses his boner. He said it feels like a lump in his throat that he can't swallow or take out. He has focused so much on my pleasure but now it's starting to get to me where I can't give in return.

Well, he kept pressuring me, telling me that I will never find friends if I continue living like this etc. I genuinely thought I could meet her but after he kept bringing it up every 15 minutes and giving me monologues on how I don't talk to anyone etc, I became less and less interested in meeting her. 

I told my therapist all that and he said it's okay not to put pressure on myself with this kind of thing. Then I told him that honestly I got used to the idea that I might be alone for some time before I go to college and finish my current school (business school), which is 3 more years. 

He told me I shouldn't think that way and I said that I didn't mean that I am not gonna talk to anyone. I just know that if I try I am gonna fail because that's how it happened every time so far. We joked around about some stuff for a while. But then he got serious out of nowhere and told me ""well, I am disappointed in you. Now you know what it feels like when someone is actually disappointed in you."" And it literally hurt so much, it came out of nowhere. I don't know what he meant by the second sentence since the issues we usually talk about (even earlier that session) are that my family sees me as less than them and everyone is disappointed in me. 

I am so anxious to go see him tomorrow. Should I bring up how I felt last session? I cried on my way home and I think about it every day. I saw him as the only person who gets me and has my back but hearing him say he was disappointed in me literally broke my heart. 

I ended up going to meet with the girl the same day I had the session (after the session), there were more people coming in. She didn't know what I looked like so as soon as I got into the café where we were supposed to meet I got extremely anxious, I ordered a lemonade and sat at a different table. I ended up crying, paid and left and got a panic attack on my way home. I think I only did it to ""prove him wrong"" in my head haha which is stupid. But I was thinking maybe by saying that he wanted to push me in the right direction. Well it didn't end well. I don't know if I should tell him all that or not.",mentalhealth,_baby_blue_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/170wmcq/my_therapist_told_me_he_is_disappointed_in_me/,23,56.56565656565657,0.5656565656565675,0.00012142174718565531

[M32] I'm quitting porn consumption.,55,0.97,1701201378.0,"TL;DR: I've decided to stop consuming porn in all forms. My reasons are non-religuous, non-political and I think they're well-thought based on my experience. I'm currently in the process of deleting everything and closing down all accounts/users. 

Basically that's it. I'm currently in a healthy 5-year relationship with my SO. I've been consuming porn (all kind) for a handful of years and I think I've had enough. My SO knowns I/I've watch/ed porn of all kind and is totally cool with it. We even comment on dudes/girls irl that we encounter.

A few weeks ago I willingly deleted beyond recovery my 1,5TB collection of porn material,, which had been harvested over the years. I thought it would feel like a liberation but it just went as ""meh, alright, delete that shit"". Even the days after, my concern was if my horny-self would deeply regret that decision, but not.
I currently still have my Pornhub and Chaturbate accounts up, as well as the email used exclusively for this kind of stuff and some other websites which I need to track down. These are my next targets for the upcoming days.

My reasons for it? A couple:
1. IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME. Man, I could go edging for like 1h every day. It felt good, but afterwards the blame and guilt for investing so much time were disgusting. I know I can edge without visuals for as long as I want, but the video shit is addictive.

2. I started to kinda ""need"" the visuals to get aroused/horny. Sometimes I even surfed TW in order to get those 30s of stimulus prior to having sex. Not good.

3. I was supporting an industry (doesn't matter if pro or amateur/homemade) with dark interests (prostitution, money for sex, e.g.) I also knew this while surfing but my horny-self was clearly in charge and that issues became totally secondary.

4. The past half year, while consuming porn I started to feel it as an addiction. I wasn't thinking the whole day about porn and wanking, but on the way back home I would definitely think about which user I would watch, where I would wank, etc. instead of using that time to do sth. productive.

5. I've seen increasingly more dudes that also took this step and everything where good words.

6. I have my own imagination, and that's beyond reality. And I sort of lost that ability. Every time I wanked and tried to just imagine a situation and it just wouldn't work.

My childhood bestfriend is suicidal and shows creepy redflags,52,0.94,1698517077.0,"/!\\ trigger warning : Rape, Suicide /!\\

Hello, sorry for the long post. I'll try to be brief, but I have a lot of infos. I'll give a bit of context first and then say some redflags things he said to me.

**Context** : My friend (19M) has been in a depressive state for about 3 or 4 years now, and is going in a downward spiral. He feels terribly outcasted in Uni. He says that he hates ""normies"" because they to social event and that he will never be like them. He's saying that everyone hates him and his disgusted by him, or that he's a degenerate. He deleted all his social networks 1 year ago. I tried to hang out with him a few times now, and I thought that it was going better over this summer, but since the beginning of the school year he's been having suicidal thoughts again.

The other day he told me something like :

>""This guy asked if I went to the big party uni was organising, and when I said no, he looked a me with a mix of hate and disgust. I fucking hate him I want to kill him.""

He also told me that he thinks a lot about r\*pe, but not in a sexual way. More like an advanced kind of violence. He told me one day that he wanted to r\*pe a girl he hated, not for the pleasure, just to hurt her. (Or to hire a guy to rape her for the same results). He also said that for the past few weeks, the only thing that would give meaning to his life would be to become a terrorist, just that he doesn't know who to aim yet. He told me that he was interested into going to the shooting range in hit city to pass time, which is something oddly new.I'm sorry if it sound fake or laughable. I don't know if he's serious or just wants to be edgy/provocative. When I asked if he was serious about killing people he said ""I would if I could, but most serial killers had social skills to lure their victims"" and that he wasn't motivated enough.

I don't know what to do. I already told him to see a psychologist multiple time, but he doesn't want to. I tried to give him advices, but I feel like this is doing more harm than good. I also tried to do hang out with him, but it's really hard to motivate him, and we don't have that much time anymore with school. I hope he's not really dangerous, but I don't want to find out that he hurt himself/others and that I could have avoided that.

tl:dr : My friend has suicidal thoughts and wants to harm people (?), I don't know what to do

Why am I so different from everyone else?,51,0.91,1692332869.0,"I (21F) feel like there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm not normal. I know there is no such thing as ""normal"" and that we're all different...but hear me out. I am a college graduate (I actually graduated when I was 19). I see other girls my age going out, having fun, going to parties, traveling the world, etc. all while I'm just here existing. I don't feel jealous or like I'm missing out, I just have no desire to do any of that. Instead of shopping with friends, I prefer shopping alone. And instead of shopping for clothes to go to wear to parties, I prefer shopping for cozy pajama sets and things to clean and organize my home with. On the weekend, instead of hanging out with friends or going out, I complete a long list of chores and tasks. When I don't finish my list, I feel worthless and hate myself. After coming home from work, it's the same routine every day: change into pajamas, relax a little, make dinner, have a shower, relax more, then I'm usually in bed before 10 but don't go to sleep until 12ish. If my schedule is disrupted, I feel agitated.  

It's like I'm an old lady trapped in a 21-year-old's body. I'm not afraid of making friends or going out, it just doesn't interest me. Crowds and social situations make me feel overstimulated, irritated, and uncomfortable, and I don't really see why they're necessary in the first place. It’s not that I can’t socialize, I’m actually very very good at it. I  just don’t like doing it; it’s outside of my comfort zone. The smallest things irritate me beyond belief. I hate 90% of the people I meet and hate going out - I actually have a Vit. D deficiency. I'm much happier in places familiar to me but I'm happiest while at home with my blinds shut, away from the outside world. Maybe I'm just a stupid, lazy complainer, I don't know. I've thought maybe I'm on the autism spectrum, but I don't know that either. Or maybe I'm just really, super depressed. I have depression and anxiety and I honestly feel like my life itself is depressing and repetitive but I'm not necessarily unhappy with it. I'm just feeling mentally and physically depleted and I wish my interests were more ""normal."" All I do is exist. I have no substance. 

My mom thinks I’m just still young and figuring things out and just need to build more confidence but this seems like more than that. 

Sorry if this makes no sense but at least I got it off my chest (kind of).

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not claiming to be on the autism spectrum, it's just something that's come across my mind as a possibility. I was an odd child and I'm now an odd adult, but that doesn't mean that I'm automatically autistic. Just like how the fact that I like to organize and make lists doesn't automatically mean I have OCD. It just means I'm different, there doesn't have to be an official medical diagnosis. If I did want to receive an official diagnosis, of course, I'd go to a professional, not the internet. I did 8 years of CBT and EMDR as well as 2-3 years of OT and never felt it was beneficial. As some of you have pointed out/speculated, I am highly intelligent and mature for my age. I graduated from high school at 16 and from a 4-year university at 19. I will be graduating with a master's degree later this year at 21. I never really struggled academically but found it difficult to make friends and feel accepted, even though I had friends (I become more anti-social and introverted when I started undergrad), I still felt like an outcast.

Boyfriend is running away from life itself :(,52,0.88,1705932877.0,"My boyfriend and I haven’t been together too long, and 100% moved in together too early. I am 24 and he just turned 30. I know everyone’s going to say the same thing everyone in my life says, which is that I deserve better. For one moment I need some people to not tell me that and instead understand that I love this man with everything in me. I have never looked at another person and felt.. idk.. safe? 

That being said, he turned 30 a couple of weeks ago and has been struggling a lot the past few months mentally. He has chrons so he’s sick a lot, even though we try and follow a vegan diet to help. He misses a lot of work due to it and then in turn feels like shit. He is new to the area so does not have many friends but me. I’ve tried to push him out to meet new people or get us out with couples to help. 

Nowww for the hard part… last Monday we signed a lease together to finally get us some more space and pay less rent (we’ve both been really stressed financially). That night we got into a tiff and the next morning he quit his job, called his mom, and moved home. Outside of me being heartbroken, I am so worried about him :(( i feel like he’s just running away from everything because of his depression. His mom is very loving, but also in my opinion, isn’t really helping. She doesn’t even have food he can eat in the house normally and does not work herself. I can tell my boyfriend wants to get out of this cycle, but I don’t know how to help anymore :( I’m constantly listening to podcasts and reading books to get myself out of my own depressions. As a child his dad left, and after trying to meet up with him a few years ago and he didn’t show, he’s given up. He was cheated on by a fiancé in 2019.

I hate being a mom,55,0.89,1702067809.0,"As the title states. I hate being a mom. I got pregnant when i was 15 and had my son when i was 16. I have struggled with mental health all my life. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder when i was 8 years old. I have tried multiple medications and been to multiple therapist but nothing has really helped my mental health. When i was 13 i started to over sexualize myself. I would wear low cut shirts, send nudes and started having sex when i was 14. That led to me getting pregnant when i was 15. My parents wouldn’t let me get an abortion or give up my son for adoption. The father was not involved and i was left to raise my son alone until i was 18 he took me to court and sued me which i am now 30 grand in debt over. My son goes to his dads every other weekend but that’s it. When I gave birth to my son i experienced really bad postpartum depression. I think i got over it but some days i’m not sure. Either way i have no bound with my son. No connection he’s just a responsibility. Now i take really good care of my son for my age. He goes regularly to the dentist and doctors. Has new clothes, shoes toys the works. Eats healthy meals and i try to give him as much love as i can like taking him out to the movies, doing fun things like the elf on the shelf but i don’t feel anything. I feel like i’m just masking all my emotions and going thru the motions. Lately all i feel like i do is yell at my son because he wastes food, won’t pick up, throws tantrums and i feel like it’s because he is feeding off my energy and environment. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I genuinely can’t do this another 14 years.

Edit: A lot of people are suggesting i give my parents custody. That’s just not an option. unfortunately parental cycles are hard to break. My mom was distant and wasn’t there for me most of my life.

I actually took some care of myself????!,52,0.98,1701846111.0,"I actually washed my hair AND brushed my teeth today.
I typically put off any showering activities for as long as I can (until I think my hair looks noticeably greasy I guess) and really didn't want to today even though I kept telling myself to. A friend encouraged me and I ended up washing my hair even though I didn't really feel like it.
I also took time to blow dry my hair when I typically air dry it (I felt like I'd probably be in a better mood with it more dry than wet) and I used hair ointment I've had after.

I even brushed my teeth, which I never do (I know I should more because I'll regret it in the future but I can't typically bring myself to do basic hygiene).

I'm currently debating on if I want to take a bath tomorrow/later (1:54am) to lift my mood more if I can, I really need to bring myself to relax and I heard a bath can typically help with that.

Seasonal depression and all year stress with anxiety (plus school, since I'm a teenager) is really beating me up and I don't talk about it to anyone for the most part, so it's more difficult to handle since nobody really knows. Gotta work my way up to help myself some until I can bring myself to actually share my feelings with anyone I see in person.

"my palm started to feel like plastic, when should i stop washing my hand?",53,0.95,1686227140.0,"last month I developed a habit where I kept on washing my hands using handwash. I just couldn't stop and don't know when my hands should be considered clean and when I should stop washing them. Here are the scenarios where I will rewash my hands using handwash soap:  
  
1- When the water from the sink bounces back onto my palms while washing.  
  
2- When I accidentally touch the sink while washing.  
  
3- I always wash my hands more than twice. I don't know why I don't think washing them once with soap is enough. Is this normal?  
  
4- I wash them more than three or four times after putting my laundry in the washing machine.  
  
5- I wash my hands with soap after using a Dettol wipe to clean my phone before cleaning my laptop. Then I wash my hands with soap again before cleaning my desk.  
  
6- I wash my hands again when I accidentally touch the faucet (tap).  
  
7- I spend alot on cleaning product, my housemate also noticed why i showered for a long time and when the water bill arrived, i dont even know how to explain.  
  
8- i feared washing machine \[touching detergent\] and tumble dryer the most, every time after using it i will wash my hand for more than 15 mins. is this normal, when does it consider as clean.  
  
Sometimes, I don't believe that my hands are clean. It's like I forget when to consider my hands clean. Sometimes, I wash my hands or take a shower for more than an hour. I keep washing my hands after touching anything in the bathroom.  
  
These habits prevent me from doing meaningful things. Sometimes, I don't sleep for days because after cleaning something in my room, I go and wash my hands with soap before cleaning the next thing. It takes so much time that I didn't sleep for two nights. Yesterday, I didn't sleep at all because I was cleaning my phone, debit card, and the sink. These habits also prevent me from cooking my own meals. Sometimes, I only eat bread and biscuits for breakfast and skip dinner and lunch. I have also stopped working out because I'm scared that if I touch the carpet, I'll spread all the germs to my housemates. I have lost a lot of weight because of this, and I wake up with anxiety. Sometimes, the first thing I do when I wake up is wash my hands with soap. My hands are so dry that it's hard for me to fully open them without risking injury. There are razor blade-like cuts on my hands, and now my palms feel like plastic. It doesn't feel normal.  
  
When should I stop washing my hands? When are they considered clean? It's so hard for me to deal with this. I have used a lot of patience, and I want to stop this as I spend more time in front of the sink than on my screen. I can't do anything productive in my life. Sometimes, I also stop hanging out with my friends because of this issue, and my friends ask me why I suddenly disappeared, and I have to come up with fake excuses. I want to stop this before it gets worse.

Why are EVERYONE so fake and awful nowadays? I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore.,53,0.93,1708257421.0,"Let me explain. I’m a 22 year old female, and I’ve learned so much recently. My entire life I’ve been very naive, and assumed everyone had good intentions. I have adhd, and I speak my mind, and thought most people did that too. I met a lot of men (and women later) who treated me very badly, and I would always ignore it and blame myself. I had a job working only with females, and I’ve never been close to fake people (that I knew of), so a lot of bad situations happened. They would talk badly about me behind my back, excluding me, making fun of me, using me as a target. Looking back I met/attracted those people because I had no boundaries, didn’t speak up, self-blamed and had very low self esteem. People always treated me badly because I let them. I learned a lot about myself and got a lot of self awareness.

My point is, people started telling me I had to understand that most people lie, are fake, and only act from selfishness and that’s just how the average human brain works. I get so disappointed in humanity, if that’s how most of the people in the world acts. Every time I met someone (usually men) I legitimately thought was nice, they would end up being an asshole after a few months. Proving my point every time. I now have to try to distant myself in my mind, from the new people I meet, because they always end up disappointing me. I would attach myself way too quickly to people in the past, legitimately caring for them, and they never gave a shit about me. 

If you think about how much awful shit, humans have been/are capable of doing (war, torture etc), it’s so scary. Are most humans just naturally bad people? Doing those extremely evil acts, and more “normalized” behaviour like abuse, harassment, lying, cheating, manipulation etc. Is the really how the average brain works?

How am I supposed to navigate in a society with liars, manipulators and fake people? It’s very discouraging and sad. It’s not possible that ALL of the people I’ve met coincidentally were the few bad ones. I’ve gone from naive and unknowing, to kind of cynical. «treat people they way you want to be treated” is apparently outdated. If you’re kind and trusting, you’ll get taking advantage of.

How common is to keep living just so you won't hurt those close to you?,51,1.0,1697685851.0,"Hi! I hope this doesn't sound tragic, it is a very honest and sincere conversation. The thing is: ever since I was kid I dicn't quite get the whole point of living as an adult. Having to work 5 days a week and barely enjoying the other two (because we have many obligations beyond work) seems like the same as being a rat in a maze.

Then, I grew up and I just confirmed my childhood perception. Honestly, it is definitely not an experience that is worth it. Not only that, but I see no rational reason to believe that in the future this will be better, specially considering how things are going in the world right now.

Made my therapist cry today.,49,0.92,1683350656.0,"Trigger warning for mild domestic violence. 

My inclination here is to make some stupid joke about how I won therapy and I'm the therapist now because, that's how I handle tough situations, but that's a different can of worms. There really isn't anything like making a seasoned therapist who's seen it all cry to really put into perspective just how fucked up you are. 

The thing that gets me is that I was just describing my day to day and the mindset I walk through life with. That's my fucking normal. That's the default. That's just my life. And watching her break down and needing to give her a minute really put it into perspective. 

I guess that objectivity is a good thing. One thing that therapy has helped me realize just how much of my mindset was just an assumed normal. That this fucking stormcloud isn't how most people live their lives. I mean we all carry a bag of rocks and if you meet someone that claims to have no baggage they're either lying, not aware of it, or the single most boring human on the planet. But having baggage and normalizing your trauma are not the same thing. 

A good example is that, amoung my other bullshit I was stabbed earlier in life by a partner and my therapist brought it up to explain current behavior patterns and my first thought was ""yeah, but come on. That was years ago..."" A stabbing. My partner coming at me with a fucking knife and here I am putting a time stamp on it like it's expired milk. Like rereading this post I described a fucking stabbing as ""mild"" abuse. I understand that it's a coping mechanism, but jesus christ. I mean she was right though, I was using ""yeah but they didn't stab me"" as an excuse for shitty behavior from current partners. 

I dunno. I guess I just needed to put this stream of consciousness into the world. I just needed to be heard. I needed to make it real by acknowledging that living my life this way is neither normal nor healthy.

Survived Suic Attempt 4 Years Ago. My Scary Experience of What It Was Like,50,1.0,1702521518.0,"\*\*Trigger Warning: My Story Includes Suic Attempt\*\*

&#x200B;

Im coming up on 4 years since surviving a pretty brutal attempt on my life, and wanted to share my story, some hope, a little advice, and reflect on what my life looks like now/WHAT I WOULD'VE MISSED OUT ON.

Jan 6, 2020, id been in a dark place for a longgggg time, and was basically a walking time-b\*\*\* waiting to go off.  My alcohol/drug addiction had reached its peak.  The weight of those consequences was so heavy on me, and knowing the weight my struggle put on ALL my family/friends (specifically a divorce i caused) felt unbearable.

&#x200B;

I was numb and at a point where I was spiritually dead.  I didnt feel happy at happy moments, I had no interest in my fav things, usually things that were sad, I felt nothing.... or at least thats what id thought.  reflecting back, they were very painful moments that i refused to acknowledge, or properly grieve. i self medicated, HEAVILY, and felt it would pass.... it didnt.

&#x200B;

All the negative stuff that I had neglected and used substances to mask, piled up like a log jam, and once it clogged, every new negative piled up farther and farther back. I had dealt with none of it, and it got to a point, where even thinking about trying to deal with a decade of emotions felt insurmountable. Id waited too long, this task couldnt be fixed.

&#x200B;

I was out of town on work, and had went for a walk with no particular purpose, but TICK, TICK, TICK, id been looking for a way out for a while. In an unfamiliar town, I had come to a railroad track right as the gates went down, the flashing red, DING DING DING and the screaming horn of a train coming through.

&#x200B;

At this point I had mastered ignoring consequences, to just do what made sense in the moment, to refuse to look ahead at the consequences of my actions; whether a year, a month, or 5mins ahead... i had conditioned myself to be selfish and only in the moment. Nothing had particularly been wrong that day, but a thought came in--- run in front of the train --- and it ends. I did exactly that.

&#x200B;

Initially after my ""accident"", I didnt remember much, its all a blur, with moments hear and there remembered, especially with time, they started to come back.  Here are some early thoughts/moments I can remember in the following days:

&#x200B;

\-Worst pain imagineable. I have a massive concussion, everything is a 10/10 blur, I think I'll never see again.  Both my arms are broken, I learn Ive already had 2 emergency surgeries

\-My left arm is ""OK"" 12 screws, a few plates, and in a cast. My right arm was a massive compound fracture, with several breaks.... they have it in some type of stabilizing brace, where there are screws into my shoulder, upper forearm, and wrist, my arm floating below it ""suspended""

\-I dont know what state Im in (truck driver), Ive been missing from family 2days with no contact. Im as vulnerable as it gets, and there are no family or familiar faces around. ATROCIOUS (cant stress this enough) feeling

\-Im in a pain med and concussion induced fog/swirl.  I dont remember the beginning of this interaction, but a Doctor is in the room with me.  The attempts to save my right arm have not worked, if I dont agree to an amputation, I will die a pretty miserable death.  Basically, my body has rejected the arm, it is dying, and my liver enzymes are growing exponentially, Im rotting to death lol

\-I DO NOT WANT TO DIE, AT ALL. I dont care how tough, nihilistic, depressed, whatevs you are, I had been in a deep state of all those.... Im not ready to leave, and Im scared of the potential for an after-life

\-I agree to the amputation, but the Doctor gives me lukewarm news... its roughly a 50/50 I pull outta this thing, even if they take the arm.  In a whirlwind of heavy news, this is the heaviest news. Im bawling, and I feel alone, the doctor holds my hand, and at that moment it is the greatest human contact imaginable. Crazy how desperate for human affection I was after years of disconnect

\-I dont remember the start of the interaction, but Im laying down, being wheeled to a room for surgery. Im starring at the drop ceiling as it rolls past, I cant see it clearly, I hear nurses talking, I cant make any of it out, and I think how crazy that THIS is the last moments I get, a pure haze.....

\- Im in a huge (or atleast it seems) surgery room... its crazy bright, it feels like a dozen people are in there, everything is a serious tone, im seeing tables with tools on them, the kind from TV, but this is me, and its real, despite how surreal it all is....... anddddddd now Im counting down backwards from 10 inhaling the sleepy gas through the mask. HOLY FUCK, THIS IS ACTUALLY IT, IM SO DUMB

&#x200B;

\--------------------------- The Big Surgery Complete---------------------

&#x200B;

Im heavily sedated, confused, my moms here though.  She cries, I cry, its amazing im here. Again, all this is incredibly cloudy, its like a film thats been cut in random places, then picks up mid scene, think ""Memento"" hahaha

&#x200B;

Im not out of the woods, we'll have to wait and see how my body responds, Ive had atleast 3 (maybe 4?) surgeries.  The nurses are all so sweet, im so happy to be alive. A few of my regulars saw me come in, had some type of interactions with me, and are so happy Ive pulled through.  I need help with everything, but these nurses dont mind at all. Unable to drink, eat, poop, pee, or do any of the bandages or anything at all. I can feel compassion and tenderness in every interaction... i feel like some sort of strange celeb.

&#x200B;

Within a few days, my brain is much better, I have a rapport with all the different nurses and aids, and Im beaming from my soul.  These ppl DO NOT KNOW ME, and they quickly feel like family.  They take care of my every need, and make me laugh and smile, they bring in food from a local restaurant, and keep me company.  Id been in a cold world for so long.  These strangers showed me all the love and compassion and value that I needed medically, but also emotionally. Somehow they not only physically nursed me back to health, but spiritually as well. Like a light switch, I felt my soul turn back on.

&#x200B;

\--------------Out of Hospital-------------

&#x200B;

In the hospital I realized booze and drugs had slowly extinguished my soul, it was a huge part of it, but there was more.  I immediately got into some Narcotics Anonymous meetings..... the same love Id gotten from the medical staff, I got there almost instantly.  My grim, pessimist attitude towards humans, has been eviscerated by a combination of these two groups of strangers.

I jump into counseling.  Another great move, at first it feels forced, but i stuck with it, eventually build some rapport, and 4years later, hes one of my best friends and my counselor.  We've grinded and knocked down a lot together. Ive learned healthy coping mechanisms. Learned to control impulsivity, especially the destructive kind.  Counseling is a wonderful tool, especially if you have a small or no support group initially.

I got a dog! Man dogs will force some love into your life.

Ive acknowledged all my past mistakes. Ive grieved them. Grieved the loss of my arm, my clean date/acci-versary are at 4years come Jan 6th.

Ive reconnected with family, apologized, been forgiven, and made a point to maintain my mental health/sobriety as a point to not be that guy who has a come to Jesus moment, and as soon as the coast is clear..... hits the pavement looking for destruction.

&#x200B;

Looking back, its crazy to me, that all this was the direct result of a split-second decision (sort of, from oversimplified perspective).  I think about what wouldve happened, had I not done that a lot. While im not 'glad i did it', i also wouldnt trade any of this back for my stupid 2nd arm lol ---im the happiest ive ever been in my life, by far, like sooooooo far.  the saddest part of dying wouldnt have just been dying, it truely wouldve been that i missed out on the chance to be happy. Im at peace, I joke/laugh, cry at commercials, tell my family (and friends- to their annoyance) I love them.

If youre reading this and struggling, please dont harden your heart against this story. Please dont miss out. Realize that - YES THIS CANNNN HAPPEN TO YOU, OR WORSE - only you can fix this.  Find any one thing small you can do, and do the shit out of it.... then add another... have uncomfortable conversations telling family whats going on.  Dont lean into the negativity youre feeling

Im 35 and fairly healthy, Ive adjusted physically, i dont think about the amputation much, it doesnt stop me from doing really anything...... Im blessed. I really couldve/shouldve died.

I suffer with depression and anxiety, I've had multiple therapists, including bereavement and I still feel like this 🤷🏻‍♀️ I can't afford private therapy or medication and I feel like I'm out of options. I think about my future and it goes nowhere, it just makes me want to cry every time and I'm so done. I've been SH more frequently because it's pretty much the only thing I can do. Everything is a fight and I'm not getting anywhere with it.

Does anyone else know they will eventually commit suicide?,48,0.98,1687009197.0,"Hi everyone. I’m a 21 year old male. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for the last 10 years of my life. It all stems from childhood trauma. I’ve been to therapy and a psychiatrist plenty of times. As I’ve grown up I’ve learned to deal with it more and more. Over the last year I dedicated my life to getting better. I got diagnosed with bi Polar depression at the beginning of 2022. I’m on medication for it now and things are going a lot better. I’ve dropped 40lbs over the last 7 months. My mental health has improved, I’m in a great relationship and working a nice and easy job with good income. But for whatever reason I can’t shake the feeling that I will eventually take my own life in a few years. I don’t want to do it now, I’m not actively doing anything to hurt myself or planning anything out. I just know that I deal with derealization and severe existential crisis on daily basis and it’s gotten so intense. I don’t want to be alive for 80 years. I’ve not had the best time living and I’m constantly in a state of hyper awareness anxiety. It sounds horrible but I genuinely don’t even wanna live till 40. My entire life doesn’t feel real. I look back on my childhood and genuinely cannot fathom that it was me. Those memories are me. Thinking back to when I was 3 (my earliest memory) I feel like it was lifetimes ago. It doesn’t feel real. I cant live like this for another 60 years. I’m not sad or like nervous about the future. It’s almost peaceful to know that I can really enjoy the next few years of my life and then I can die content and happy.

My boyfriend is making me feel exhausted.,51,0.95,1706902797.0,"Context for my current life. I moved away from home about 7 months ago now right after graduating high-school to be with my boyfriend (Lets call him J). I had been living with a roommate but after a couple months J had a mental health crisis and I had to move him into our apartment because he said he wouldn't be safe if I wasn't with him everyday. I didn't really feel ready for that yet but I obviously didn't want him to hurt himself so I had him move in despite that.


For context on J, he has BPD and Autism. He's undergone a lot of traumas and mental hardships, I completely understand and accept that he feels differently and often times more strongly than I do, and that it is hard for him to manage himself, but I feel completely worn down trying to take care of him.


J likes to go to music shows and venues, that really helps him fulfill his social needs. I'm more introverted, and those sorts or things are usually pretty draining for me. I've expressed this to J but I always end up going with him anyways. J doesn't drive, so I drive him usually around half an hour to go to these shows. I know J has other friends they could plan to go to these with, but ever since I've moved here I've been the person going with him. This is because J doesn't feel comfortable going places without me.  No matter what I don't really have a choice except to accompany J to these shows, because if I don't they won't bother to go with someone else, and they will have a breakdown later.


When J has a breakdown, I am the one who stays with them and makes sure hes safe. These breakdowns can last hours, and he has yelled, insulted, and pushed me (never enough to make me fall or cause harm) during them. These breakdowns are absolutely exhausting and traumatic for me to deal with, so most of my energy goes into preventing them from happening how ever I can. These breakdowns can be caused by a lot of things, some recent examples being


-The house isn't clean enough

-I don't want to be sexual with J at the moment, even though he wants to be

-J is tired

-J is hungry


There's other reasons Js has breakdowns, many of them are reasonable reasons to be upset, stuff like J feeling like im not properly addressing or handling his health (J has epilepsy,  and there are times I could have better handled situations regarding that.)


To make sure J doesn't have a breakdown I basically always have to be on stand by for him at all times. He mostly asks me to do simply tasks like making food, or going to the corner store to get him something. Nothing that really should take much out of me, but the fact that I have to deal with these things immediately and without negotiation whenever he wants is a little stressful. If J asked me to make him food and I said no, he would feel neglected, and probably not eat, which could lead to a breakdown. I just really wish I had my own time and space where I felt like I could just focus on myself.


J and my roommate don't get along because they dated in the past and had some major problems. J doesn't even want to talk to my roommate, which means I'm usually the one medigating between them. J wants to use the TV but roommate is using it? I have to ask to use it on his behalf. Roommate left a mess in the kitchen? I have to bring it up to roomate. 


I feel selfish but I can feel how tired I am. I'm irritable all the time, and I hurt myself pretty often because it's the only way to manage that. My memory is awful, and I feel like I'm in a haze a lot of the time. I don't eat enough anymore, and large aspects of my life are going neglected because I can't muster the energy to deal with them. I'm fucking losing myself, even writing this I realize how much off and robotic I seem but that's all I can be. I've been wanting to write a post like this for a while and I just didn't have the energy until now, and even now I don't have the energy to sound anything but robotic. I'm trapped in my life and I feel like I'm completely drowning.",mentalhealth,AlienBovine,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ahc8cw/my_boyfriend_is_making_me_feel_exhausted/,44,53.684210526315795,2.6842105263157947,0.00011523654164292739
Life is great. And I want to die.,47,0.98,1702478542.0,"I haven't slept in 36 hours. Cried silently and alone for about half of that time. I'll try to keep it short:

* I am 24F, almost 25, and am Asian, if that helps provide any general cultural context for what's to follow.
* I was diagnosed with major chronic depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, bipolar 2, and ADHD around 21 yrs-old when I finally got health insurance for the first time and sought help. It took that long because my family just never understood what mental health was, let alone seeking professional help/diagnoses, and we went through financial hardships throughout my high school/college years so we wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway.
* Despite being undiagnosed with so many issues and experiencing a wide range of traumas, I grew up relatively well-adjusted, and a star student. I played multiple instruments, I excelled in sports, won medals, graduated high school with a 3.97 GPA, got scholarships into college, and even graduated college at the top of my class as salutatorian in 2021. I have many friends and am part of many social circles.
* My mom, the absolute most loving, supportive, beautiful woman in the world.. was diagnosed with Leukemia in my senior year of college. I'm so thankful she lived long enough to watch me receive my diploma. She died from Leukemia the following year in April 2022. Our entire family was lost without her. I was (and honestly am still) absolutely destroyed by her death. I was her main caretaker for the last few months of her life. I was with her in hospice when she took her last breath.

So here I am. Still grieving. Unemployed since August because I work in the animation industry and I think we all know how *that's* been with the recent strikes.

I don't know. I don't know what to write. I'm just rambling because I'm spiraling. Am I writing a *note?* 

Once I was diagnosed, I did start medications, and kept with them for about the last 2.5 years until my health insurance (provided by my employer) ran out because we were all laid off. I've been off them since August, so if I *did* go through withdrawals, I honestly couldn't tell you because my life has never been stabile enough for me to have a baseline to compare to. I could've been taking sugar pills for all I know, I don't know. Maybe the medications just lessened how extreme the extremes could be, but I know for sure that before, during, and after meds, I have and still always feel depressed, anxious, low energy, low motivation, irritable, self-deprecating, etc, etc. 

But on paper, I'm so successful. To my peers and relatives, I'm a role model. I'm the first descendent born in the US to graduate from college, and as salutatorian. My name can be found in the credits of a very successful TV show. I have an incredible support system through my dad, my brother, my SIL, and my partner. I have a house under my name.

And I want to die. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing brings me any lasting satisfaction. I try to stay social, reach out to friends, go out on dates, and we regularly have family dinners. But everything is just a distracting from the never-ending inner turmoil I'm going through. When I stop moving, when I lay in bed and everything is quiet, all the negatives thoughts come back, and I grieve for my mom. The ""nothing makes me happy"" part has been a thing since high school, well before she died, but it definitely amplified with her passing.

I feel nothing from playing video games and hobbies that I used to love when I was younger. I eat like shit and have become overweight. I feel like a disgusting shell of myself. I hate the way I look in the mirror, and my brain just tells me, ""You let yourself get fat and ugly. You deserve to stay fat and ugly."" even though my family and partner regularly reassure me that I am still beautiful and that my worth isn't tied to my appearance. But I can't help it. I was the ugly kid growing up, then I had a glow up in high school and looked good as hell through college. And then my mom died, so I just stopped taking care of myself. In a similar way, I was a spoiled upperclass kid growing up, then suddenly poor through middle and high school, then back to being very comfortable once the new family business kicked off during my college years, so now I don't even know how to feel about money.

I know I need therapy. I've never had therapy except some crisis counseling I got through my university, but they weren't even licensed therapists yet. They were interns/students still working on their psych degree. I enrolled in obamacare this November, so I should finally have health insurance again starting January 2024, but I don't know if/when I'll find a safe and reliable therapist.

Will I make it to Christmas? Will I make it to New Years? Will I make it to my birthday the following month?

Part of me wants to die, part of me absolutely refuses to put my family through that after having lost Mom, especially to my dad and brother who have shown nothing but love and support for me. Truly, I am so, so, so, lucky.

Which is why I feel even more guilty for feeling this way. Life is so good right now. Our family business is bringing in a comfortable income, and I'm not being rushed or forced to get any menial job that'll likely add to my stress. Everyone gets along and loves one another, and especially love me.

And I still want to die. I've always had it at the back of my mind since middle school. I've never self harmed in ways that would be permanent (cutting, burning, etc), though I did develop an unhealthy coping mechanism of bashing my head/forehead onto walls/tables and digging my nails into my palms.

I'm just.. I don't know. I just sobbed and doomscrolled throughout the night and now it's 9:30 in the morning.

I (19F) think i’m a cocsa victim but i’m not so sure.,47,1.0,1694256404.0,"So a couple of months ago i came across a tiktok of a woman discussing “cocsa” and how it’s rarely talked about. I wasn’t sure what that meant at the moment so i looked into it more and it uncovered a memory I locked away in my head.
When I was 6 or 7 my cousins slept over at our apartment and in the morning we decided to play house with my siblings. My cousin who is a year older than me, so at the time either 7 or 8, took charge and assigned everyone roles in the house. He made my 3 siblings and his 1 brother be the children, and him and i be the “mom and dad”. I remember we had a closet with a decent amount of toys in it so we all ended up playing in there. When our siblings left the closet, he urged me to stay in the closet with him. He said mommy and daddy’s have to kiss because that’s what grown ups do, so we did. I dont remember it lasting more than 30 seconds and that’s stretching it. When I left the closet, we heard spongebob begin to play on the tv in the living room and our siblings went running to sit on the couch and watch tv. I remember exclaiming “ooh spongebob!!” and then turning to walk away, but he grabbed my arm and told me to stay and that he thought spongebob was boring. I said okay and sat down with him on the bed and he started kissing me under the blanket. Somehow my curtain rod fell off the window, I still don’t know how it did but it was never really reliable in the first place. That scared me a lot because I knew what we were doing was wrong so I told him I really wanted to watch spongebob. He told me to do one more thing, even typing this right now is making me sick..he made me perform oral s8x on him, but he said just do one lick. Afterwards he kissed me again (still under the blanket) and my dad came in and pulled the blanket off and he grabbed me. my dad pulled me into my moms room where she was sitting with my aunt folding clothes (his mother) and he said out loud “(my name) was in the room kissing damn (his name)” They both got up fast and my aunt went to get him and talk to him in the other room, and my mom talked to me in her room . She asked me why I did it..and my answer was “because he made me do it”
I can’t remember what happened after that, but my cousins left pretty soon.
This whole situation just bothers me constantly. Like, I KNOW i was a child but why didn’t I just leave the room..why did i let him take control over my mind like that? But why did he do it in the first place and why me? and we were so young, does it even count as abuse? I don’t have a relationship with him nowadays, and even in our older kid ages, i still kept my distance from him. I was 11 when I went to his water park birthday party and I remember just not saying a word to him because I was afraid he remembered what happened back then. We were in the lazy river and he caught up to me and he started to speak but before I could let him get another word in, I submerged myself under the water hoping he would be gone when i came back up but he was still there and asked me “remember when we were little , you were always so happy to see me “ and i gave a nod and floated away. Anyways that kind of went off topic but i’ve been thinking about talking to my mom about it but i have no idea how to bring it up or what to say at all. I feel that one incident opened my curiosity up at a really young age to where I began watching porn at the age of 8. Fortunately my mom caught me and introduced me to a game called Roblox that took my mind off the inappropriate thoughts for a while but i eventually started seeking out inappropriate games on roblox for a while and to my surprise there were many. I won’t get into any more details about my current state but I Am no longer interested in watching porn and i would actually rather consider myself being a prude. I even convinced myself i was asexual for a while but i debunked that pretty quickly, despite not being a virg. I just feel so shitty and weird and disgusting for what happened when we were little and i strongly believe that one moment shaped my sex life. Should i mention it to my mom ?

In my past relationships I've stayed despite the relationship making me feel awful. My last one before this caused a SH relapse and I still didn't leave. I didn't think I deserved better. I didn't think I deserved to feel good in a relationship.

I feel like I've lost everything.,43,1.0,1688464657.0,"I've genuinely lost everything

I have done it.

I have made the mistake of laying all my future plans and goals, all my love and affection, all my dreams, all my hopes, everything I ever wanted to achieve on this one person.

She was the biggest support pillar in my life, despite not doing anything. She didn't need to do anything to be that to me. All I needed, was her to just love me and be happy, just enough so she would stay by my side.

But I failed. This wonderful, amazing person, this person I prioritised over everything, lost feelings for me.

She came into my life so willing to love me, and I funked it up. I made so many bad decisions, so many fucking mistakes.

I tried my hardest to fix things, despite feeling her slip away, feeling her slowly drift apart from me, I kept going. 

I truly thought I could make it work.


It's been 3, maybe 4 months of no contact. I've had to try so hard to not contact her, to not send her heartfelt messages, to not send her voice recordings of how much I love her still, because I know she's happier, and I know that she knows how much she means to me.

She just doesn't want to be with me, and I can barely wrap my head around that thought. 
How? How could I have funked up this badly?

Things weren't perfect but I didn't care, all I wanted was for her to be happy with me, and after 3 years of us being together, of ups and downs, I failed.


She was my everything. Now I don't even feel like moving on is an option, despite being forced to. It feels like I've just been left behind by the person I loved most.

Why should I even try and be happy, and achieve goals. Why should I put myself first, after I funked everything up.


I can't even believe that I can be okay without her.

I'm in so much emotional pain that my chest is genuinely hurting, physically. 


My heart wants to crawl back to her, to keep trying everything to be with her, but my mind knows that it won't ever be enough.

There's nothing I can do to make her love me.
And you would think, that that would give me enough closure to move on. But it's just making me feel helpless, lost, scared. 


I've only been surviving by following some instructions from a person that genuinely cares for me: ""take it day by day.""

But it still hurts so much. Each day feels so fucking hard to go through.

I was so okay, so used to loving more, giving more, sacrificing everything for her. I didn't care about that. All I wanted was her to be happy and love me, even half as much as I loved her.

But I failed.

I felt so responsible for her happiness, I just remember how confident she grew into the relationship, and I truly felt like it was my job to keep her always happy and to protect her from harm. But now, now that she's gone and is happier without me, I feel I've failed beyond belief.

And I appreciate a lot when people try to tell me that, if she was truly the one she would have stayed, she would have helped work things out, but how can I genuinely believe that statement, if I wholeheartedly know that it was my mistakes that slowly drove her away? 
It shouldn't have been her responsibility, she gave me another chance, but unfortunately she herself wasn't able to truly love me even after that.


I'd wish that she just knew how much she truly meant to me, how much I truly fucking love her and how I will never be able to forgive myself for ruining things. 
But I know, that even if she knew, it wouldn't change anything.

Thank you to everyone who replied with helpful suggestions as these all helped very greatly.


Towards the end of 2021 my brother began to develop depression and anxiety, he was 15 years old at the time. In January of 2022 he broke into my fathers gun safe and told us that he was going to take his life. My parents sent him away to a mental facility for 2 months. Ever since then he has he aggressive outbreaks for 2 years and has been sent to mental facility’s multiple times. Now at the start of 2024 he is at a point where he has completely isolated himself in a extra bedroom of our home. Whenever we would try to approach him he would begin to show aggression. When this first started he would come out a few times a day to use the restroom and to eat and drink water, fast forward to now he hasn’t been coming out at all. He has torn up the room, clawed holes in the bed, ripped off parts of the wall and other things of that nature. He hasn’t come out to eat in a little over 24 hours, nor has he coke to get water. As of yesterday the door was open and my mother saw that there was a large puddle on the bed of urine. My mother asked him about it and she saw that he had completely peed himself. He gave her no response when she asked. She cleaned up the bed and sheets but he refused to take a shower or change his clothes (he has not showered, or changed clothes ever since he started isolating himself). Now to today, my mother went to go check on him due to having worries about him not eating and his urine incident from last night. When she went in the room he was sitting on the edge of the bed shivering and just staring into the distance (keep in mind he has no phone so we don’t know what he is doing in there all day every day). Later she came back into the room to find him standing up with urine rolling down his leg and standing in a puddle of piss. That brings us to now, we don’t know how to get him somewhere (because it is obvious he needs help). He isn’t a harm to himself or others so the police can’t help and we know for sure he will not get in the car to go anywhere. So I am asking for options because he needs help urgently.",mentalhealth,DapperShoe2550,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1agt7wx/my_family_needs_help_we_dont_know_what_to_do_with/,19,43.0,0.0,9.230221031595261e-05

I genuinely don't get why you should forgive the ppl that did you so wrong. Can you not heal without that?

my stepdad passed away a couple days ago. i don’t know what to do with myself. what to do, how to feel. i’m no stranger to losing people but this. this one. i just can’t. i just saw him the day before. we were gonna clean something up the next day. we made plans. he just didn’t make it through the night. 
he was a marine. served 30 years. was honorably discharged, so he left and met my mom. they married, he moved it. i was maybe 4 or 5. i knew this man my whole life. the man i wish was my biological father. but that’s neither here or there. he’s my dad. period. 
the thing that’s weighing on my so much i can’t breathe is how much he confided in me. told me secrets he swore himself he’d never tell anyone. after each talk i felt like i walked away with 200 extra pounds on my shoulders. 
he was a functioning alcoholic. wasn’t one of those angry drunks. 
i found his diaries. seeing what he wrote. his decline, what he was going through. his anxiety and ptsd. he was suffering alone. he didn’t. have to. that damn stubborn man i swear. 
i went on a 4 day trip with my fiancé. i came back and saw him. he looked normal. but he didn’t come out of his room the whole day. 
i went in there and he was a mess. couldn’t control his bowels. shaking uncontrollably. said he was cold. i gave him my blanket. i’ve seen him like that before. it was usually something i could do to fix it. 
not this time. 
me and my mom cleaned him up. he was shitting blood and throwing it up
the look he gave me before the ambulance door closed. oh my god i’ll never forget it. how soft his eyes were. i’d never seen them like that before. 
our dogs won’t eat now. the house is eerily quiet. the sound of his tv not being on now. i can’t even go downstairs and walk without feeling my legs and knees shake. 
the pressure on my mom now. taking over the bills and we’re seeing we can’t afford anything. even if i chipped in my own money, wouldn’t even come close.

HELP ME : I got groomed and sexually assaulted and I don't know if i want to go to court,40,0.88,1708266783.0,"I (M14) is friend with a really cool guy well name Ethan i met on valorant 9 months ago. Even though we were online friends, we were really close and basically knew everything about each others irl life. Same with others member of the discord we were on. Ethan had a lot of brothers, but the one im gonna talk about in this post is K (M26). There were rumors about K being a pedo, as he had apparently asked for nudes and threatened to rape a girl that was on the server. It started when she was nine, shes now 16. This girl is no longer on the server cause of arguments.  


So, a few days ago, K dmed me, i instantly thought that was weird cuz why would he dm me THE ONLY MINOR and im also ftm so my voice is girly out of all the other online people. We werent close at all, only talked each other 2 or 3 times. Third message he sent already had sexual connotations, and we kept talking, he was always talking about sex and how people love ""femboys"" like me. I texted Ethan about it, and he go angry at me, saying I had to stop seeing him as a pedo as there were no proofs what the girl, lets call her Eli, said was true. He said this was a normal conversation we could have add cuz we like to do sex jokes. He convinced me, and I felt bad for seing him as a pred, so i kept talking to him like i normally would with anyone.   


The next day, after once again a conversation filled with sex ""jokes"" he asked my insta cuz he wanted to say something private to me. I did, turn out the private thing was that he wanted to jerk off to my ""femboy ass"". Thats when it got fucked up, he started asking for pic and sex calls, threatening me and my family when I refused. He then threatened me even more with these pictures.  


I felt like shit, and didnt know what to do, so I went and did the only thing i could do, I talked to Eli. If this happened to her, she would understand how i felt. I hadnt talked to her for months, and she shared that K was still asking her for things and talking to her. She told me to block him, that he wouldnt do anything since he would be the one in trouble. As stupid as this sounds, this really helped me. I blocked him everywhere, and went to talk to ethan about his brother. He believed me, said he was sorry for not taking me seriously, and banned K from the server so i didnt have to leave. Him and another friend talked to K and Ethan's mom.   


Fast forward to now. K's mom wants to talk about this to their therapist, and talk to me tonight, which i  will gladly do since i feel really bad for this poor woman. The other is telling me I should go and file a complaint, and I agree. (He did this to atleast three other girls without counting eli and I). The thing is Im scared, scared to talk about it to my mom and the police. I know i need to but i just want to never talk about this again. I want to throw up just thinking about it.

How I went from living in hell from a brain injury to healing and living in heaven. ❤️,41,0.96,1706024548.0,"My life was absolute hell after I suffered a brain injury from deep sea diving, I can’t even explain the tournament I lived every day. I was diagnosed with countless serious mental illnesses, I didn’t know that kind of pain existed here on earth.

I have lived in hell. I planned my end and went to do it. I was moments away from doing it. Then I had a thought about my dear mother grieving me ending my own life, it stopped me in my tracks.

I decided to dedicate my life getting better. That was 10 years ago. If I ended it that day, I wouldn’t have experienced the best 10 years of my life. Since that day I have married my dream wife, had a beautiful baby boy, followed my wildest childhood dreams to make ocean documentaries and made and starred in a Disney series, bought my first home, travelled the world, made beautiful friendships and most importantly of all I am now stronger mentally and physically than I have ever been, and it’s all thanks to going through the hell of what I went through mentally after my brain injury.

There’s no way you have tried everything because there are limitless possibilities of ways you can get better. Keep trying! You have the strength of thousands of years of your ancestors. Visualise getting better. This storm is here to make you a warrior. All the most beautiful and powerful people on this earth have been through hell.

How did I do it? Focus on your health 110%. Move your body, exercise, eat clean unprocessed food, get sunlight, nature, dogs :), friendships, have a clear goal and purpose to work towards and have a plan of how you’ll reach that goal, watch inspirational people, limit screen time, push yourself outside your comfort zone daily, follow your passions, research scientifically proven supplements that can help mental health, each of these improvements will get you a little stronger each day and before you know it you will look back with pride that you have weathered a hellish storm and came out the other side as a warrior who can take on anything.

Desperate Help. My younger sister (16F) is ruining her life slowly.,42,0.92,1704267943.0,"Just for some background. I am a 20yo young man and live with my parents go to school and work a job, my Father is a hard worker that is working countless nights trucking for the family but usually isnt around due to his working. My mother raises the other 4 children in my family on her own and works at a daycare on the weekends. Our family was never wealthy but we always had just enough to get buy.

&#x200B;

Now as for my sister lets just call her Jessica, she has always been an anti-social type, she never really had many friends, and she spends most her days in her room drawing. Aside from that, she would eat with the family and didnt cause problems.

This past year however, Jessica has gotten progressively worse; nowadays she completely neglects herself and her surroundings, does not ever interact with family, she does not eat any food except for barbecue chips and coke and says every other food is dirty, she will barely sleep, she even developed something in her mind that everything is dirty and will spend hours in the bathroom trying to ""clean"" something even if it was never dirty to begin with.

She refuses to sleep on her bed because its ""dirty"", she refuses to even open a door without having a napkin covering the handle. Whenever, shes confronted by Mom or Dad for this she just has an emotional breakdown and never changes her ways.

I feel horrible for my mother, she deals with her problems everyday Jessica has made her cry because my mother just doesnt know what to do with her as it seems like it gets worse for Jessica by the day.

&#x200B;

Our family does not understand her problem, we desperately need help/information on how we can fix this and get Jessica back to living a life that is not miserable and self-harming to herself.

Took adderall and don’t know what to do,41,0.94,1698795254.0,"Hello,

So I recently had an exam I was not ready for at all - did not study due to personal issue but the day before the exam at about 9pm. I got some adderall from a friend and took it (it says 30 on it so I’m guessing 30mg)

I have trouble focusing and staying productive - always end up really distracted or incapable of retaining anything i study but Jesus I took that pill and by 2am I had memorized and understood every concept I needed for the exam. 

I studied the anatomy of the ear, and about 5 chapters worth of work, which usually would have taken me weeks.

I’ve taken it again today

I scored a 98 on the exam and I’m trying to convince myself to not take it again because of everything I’ve read about it, but why? Why should I not? I’ve never felt more alive. My friends say I look better, I’m speaking more fluently/confidently. I feel more confident, I drive better, I see more, I feel like I’ve been looking at the world and it’s so dull but not anymore, i finally want to leave my room, talk to people, look at the goddamn grass and smell some dogshit while I walk in the park. I feel f*cking powerful.

I don’t feel the need to eat so much to make myself feel better, I feel in control of my actions.

I feel pathetic because my parents witness me having them. Which mainly is me just crying uncontrollably and trying to stay away from others/hide it, but I’m not good at hiding crying. 

I want to hide it because everyone always asks “can I do anything to help” which the last thing I want when this is happening is any sort of attention. I cannot think rationally when I’m in this state, so verbalizing my needs doesn’t work, I just shut everybody out because I’m not thinking straight. 

And yes I’ve been in therapy most of my life, but haven’t needed it in a year or so. I don’t think therapy will help in this situation as I’ve tried it before and didn’t help long term and hardly short term. 

I know what I need and it’s to cry it out, crying is my bodies way of releasing stress (and humans in general but most don’t let themselves cry which sounds awful). But regardless it makes me feel down in the dumps as I’m crying, but after I often feel relief. I guess I just have to live with it.

I’ve been told by my brother growing up that my crying is “pathetic” so I think I internalized that opinion of his and now believe everyone views crying as pathetic. I just hate to be a bother to others.

I just feel that i wanna sleep for like months, and stay alone even tho i'm a very extraverted person, i just wanna be alone but i dont wanna disappoint them 
I'm during my finals now and even i tried to set some boundaries to my friends, they keep asking me to go out and i feel like sh*t telling them no cause i don't wanna disappoint them, and i feel that i am by saying no.
I already have ADHD (diagnosed) so i'm overwhelmed easely and i thought i got out of a depression but like its so, so hard lately.

I recently found out I'm not ok.,39,0.95,1712148810.0,"*I'm not sure if that's the right flair. This is more of a vent*

I don’t remember much of anything from 0-8 years old.
During that time, my parents filed for bankruptcy, my mom worked nights, my dad got let go and no one was hiring, we had 6 people living in a >2 bedroom apartment/house (we kept moving). 

I went to cbt therapy for 2 years for my OCD. This year I started talking therapy. I was telling him about my life and how I was always considered the golden child, and he asked me ""why?"". ""Because I was a good child? I did my school work without complaining, I never spoke unless spoken to,, I went to bed right after dinner...""
He interrupted ""why?"". ""Because that is what good kids do, and I'm a good kid?"" He asked ""why did you want to be a good kid?"". ""Because bad kids get in trouble, and I'm not a bad kid."" He asked ""what happened when you got in trouble?"". I froze, this conversation had seemed pointless to me but I suddenly felt like I couldn't speak, my eyes started watering, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. ""Nothing"" I said, ""then why are you shaking?"" He replied. ""I don't know"".. ""did he hit you? Did your father hit you if you got your homework wrong, if you didn't go to bed after dinner, if you spoke to much? Is that why?"" ""I don't know. He didn't hit me. I dont remember him hitting me, only yelling quietly."" ""he didn't? ""I don't know""

After that we talked about things I didn't know I didn't want to talk about. 

The week after we talked about phobias. ""What are you afraid of?"". I didn't even need to think. ""Buzzing big ass bugs, the dark, and not being able to speak."". ""Why?"", ""because my sister trapped me in the wasp infested pantry and turned off the light. I was too scared to scream. My eyes were pouring alligator tears but I was too scared to breath."" ""Oh."" He said. ""Did she do anything else to you?"". I had to think, but the more I remembered the less good I felt. My sister had bit, choked, kicked, hit me, cut my hair.. ""one time we were playing pizzeria and I was the pizza. She took my mom's fabric cutter that looks like a pizza cutter and ran it over my bad. My favorite purple shirt was stained that day. (I joked). I thought it was a silly story. He asked, ""you cared more about a shirt than your body?""...""you don't understand, it was my favorite shirt.""

Next session we talked about whatever I wanted.

He asked me what the scares on my arms were from.  ""I don't self harm if that's what your getting at. I work in a kitchen, you get burned in a kitchen."" ""What's that one from"" (pointing at the biggest one) ""it was a cooked to order item and I was afraid I was going to drop it so I put my hand underneath. All the hot grease was dripping onto my arm."" ""Did it hurt?"" ""Of course it did its 400° grease straight off the grill."" ""Couldn't you have used a plate?"" ""I could've but it would had taken extra time to grab a plate plus then I'd have a dirty plate."" He said ""a dirty plate is worth more than your body, you care more about a purple shirt than your body. Why don't you care?"".. ""it was my favorite shirt, and I think the scares look cool."" ""Why do you like being hurt? You're harming yourself and lying saying your not.""

I'm quitting therapy, I didn't like that. I didn't like how scared I felt, i didn't like anything about it.

my dad is gone and i feel so empty,38,0.97,1703817357.0,"this summer i lost my dad. he died totally unexpectedly in his sleep. this has been 6 months now and it feels like living hell. this last semester of school felt impossible. i started going through old videos on my phone just to try to find his voice to hear it again. and all i could find was little snippets and it makes me miss him so much. having to be at home for christmas break is torture. i have to be in this house which is now so empty. i have to look at the room he slept in. i have to walk through the room he always worked from home in. i have to live in my room which is the last place i ever saw him. i have to see his truck in the driveway, and it gives me a fleeting moment of calm, comfort, and safety. but in fractions of a second the feeling is ripped away. ive never wanted to just somehow be able to bottle a feeling up and be able to keep it. my mom wanting to stop running the central air conditioning system in the house, because so few rooms in the house get used now. because its so empty. the house is so empty now.  
  
ive never had a christmas that i just experience so little excitement about. its horrible. christmas day has never felt so empty. such a lack of joy. my mom could tell i was bothered and told me to go take my antidepressants. it just makes me feel even more so that im just a burden. no one wants to be around me unless im medicated.  
  
that may have come out of nowhere but i struggled with thoughts like that even before my dad passed away. for a number of reasons, some known and some not, i have felt unlovable, unloved, and unworthy for a couple years now. ive gone to therapy both before and after this summer. and now that the only person who i feel like would ever actually love me unconditionally is now gone. i feel like i have no one who really cares about me. much less anyone who loves me or enjoys my company. maybe this is selfish but on christmas day the only person who reached out to me at all was my ex who i am no contact with right now. the only person that might even pretend to care is her.  
and i even get doubts now that my dad was even proud of me, or loved me as much as my other siblings. i know logically that he really did love me but i'll have meltdowns where all i can feel like is a failure and disappointment and worthless to everyone, including my dad. i cried over an internet stranger saying ""your dad is proud of you"" who was consoling someone else who had lost their dad. i have no idea why i think he isnt proud of me. i've noticed i have problems where i feel like i have to earn my love.  
  
i have no idea what to do. ive considered online therapy. im just so lost and so empty. i have meltdowns at least once every 2 or 3 days. usually alone in my room. i feel like too much of a burden to ever reach out to someone during one. i feel like i need to cry for help from someone but i always feel like too much of a burden. anyways if anyone bothered to read this thank you very much. im not even really asking for solutions i just wanted to write this and put it out there somewhere. thanks.",mentalhealth,yourselfjustyou,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/18tbz3h/my_dad_is_gone_and_i_feel_so_empty/,9,39.175257731958766,1.1752577319587658,8.409215996178853e-05

Like when you have an overly controlling person, someone having an episode, etc.

All are results of mental instability. But people won't hesitate to write ""*boo, parents didn't hug you enough as a child?*"" and other hurtful things.

Proof that it's getting worse: ""Karen"" jokes and videos are very popular and Karens are hated. But being a Karen is just a result of growing up with overly contolling parents.

You could have great talents in art, music, sports, whatever, but if it's not studying it doesn't matter.

My teacher made a self harm joke. Of course she didn't know that I self harm but I don't think that justifies it at all. Let's call her Mrs. Marina because that's almost her name. English class. We're doing work at tables of about four people. Mrs. Marina sat down to speak with me personally about my assignment. I needed help with it but it turned into a conversation between me, her and the two other students at my table. She had some scrapes on her arm and then held her arm up and told us that she had been scrabbed by some tree branches and that we shouldn't worry because she's ""not some little emo boy who..."" and then gestured in a wrist-cutting type motion. It was an awful thing to hear from a teacher I had actually liked. But seeing the other two boys laugh I had to force a laugh of my own. Hearing something I struggle with be referred to in such a degrading, belittling way by somebody who is supposed to be protective and caring or whatever was just weird. It really rubbed me wrong but I couldn't really voice those thoughts to my friends or another teacher afterwards because then they might assume I self harm, which I do.

I've likely had an ischematic stroke at the age of 12. I've not been the same since.,38,0.93,1685042606.0,"When I was 12, I remember a day in my life that made me feel like I was dying. I woke up for school, my face felt numb and my arms were very floppy. I managed to get myself to the living room and my mum made me toast and some tea. So I grabbed a fork, dipped it in the tea and put it on my face. I was confused. Why was there no toast in my mouth? Moreover, why can't I control my arm? 

My mum thought I was clowning around and asked me what I'm doing. I tried to say something but my tongue was so numb, all I could make were noises with no words. 

A few minutes went by and my whole body went numb, but that numbeness felt like a burning pain. I couldn't walk at this point. I managed to tell my mum that I can't go to school today. Through my numb tongue, I had to speak slowly. It was difficult but at that point I realised I'm not just sick. I thought I was dying. 

At that point my mum started to panic and called the emergency services. I collapsed on the floor, fading in and out of consciousness. Every second felt like a thousand eternities. I began to believe I made my whole life up. Every second I wanted to die rather than endure this. My body felt like it was in a washing machine. I couldn't lift my arms or legs. When I was conscious, I'd scream for hours and hours (probably more like minutes). Nothing felt real. 

I don't remember what the paramedics did, my mum said they tested whether my pupils would dialate and constrict. My pupils were dialated and wouldn't respond to light. Though the thing that bothers me most is that while I buried this incident deep in my mind, I asked my mum about this incident 7 years after. 

 I study neuroscience and even before that I was a huge science nerd so when I learnt about the symptoms of a stroke in detail, I immediately got a panic attack, I felt like I was dying once again, I collapsed on the floor crying and screaming once again.  My arms went floppy without that numb feeling, but I felt just as helpless.

When I asked my mum about what happened, she told me they did some tests on me but they accused me of being on drugs. I was 12 and didn't even take a sip of alcohol. Who looks at a 12 year old, unable to speak, unable to move, on the floor, pupils not responding to light and accuses them of doing drugs? 

I just feel... Alone since then. Whenever my body has any sort of medical issue, I begin to hate myself, feel like it's my fault. I feel like nobody would care if I died.

Should I go back to using cannabis?,36,0.82,1710869905.0,"I quit using cannabis about six years ago because of anxiety.

It was only about three drinks per week at first, but now I have been binge drinking every Monday (my day off) for the last several weeks. I'm concerned that my new habit will turn into alcoholism if I don't return to using cannabis.

Should I just go back to using cannabis? I don't feel as though 100% sobriety is good for me, and this alcohol definitely isn't good for me.

So concerned about my daughter,35,0.98,1704238805.0,"My daughter is 18, a college freshman. She has had some ups and downs over the years, but lately she seems to be in a downward spiral. In 7th grade she had a particularly difficult year, and developed trichotillomania (sp?). I tried to get her help and therapy and it helped a little, at least to the extent that she slowed down and eventually stopped before she got a bad bald spot. Freshman year of HS Covid hit and like most other teens of this era it affected her social life and maturity. She came through and seemed to find her people through singing and theater and her grades improved. She had a pretty decent group of friends, never a best friend though. 
College so far has been a very rough road. She’s far from home, with no friends or acquaintances nearby. She made a group of friends early on in the first semester and they literally dropped her, icing her out of the group entirely while posting on snap all of their get togethers without her (social media 😡). She was very down about it and I had no idea how to help her. 
Now here’s the reason I’m posting. I obviously love my daughter more than anything. But I am concerned that her personality is putting people off. She is very emotionally immature, never wants to talk about anything real, can’t/wont talk about her feelings, never shows interest in others feelings. It’s like she has no emotion at all. She’s also put on a lot of weight (well beyond the freshman 15) and eats nothing but crap, never exercises and stares at her phone all day. You can imagine the eye rolling I get when I try to suggest anything changing in that arena. I know she’s depressed. I asked her if she was and her reaction was a nervous smile and a shrug, very typical of her. 
What can I do to help her?  I suggested therapy and got the smile/shrug again. If she’s not open to it I doubt it will help. It’s so hard because she’s now technically an adult and I can’t consult with her doctor anymore.",mentalhealth,Ambitious_Heat1804,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/18x4549/so_concerned_about_my_daughter/,30,35.714285714285715,0.7142857142857153,7.666296537869818e-05

We are doing long distance, and have been together for three years. 

It’s been really rough for him in his own life (family issues that turned monetary) during that time, and this year and last month it’s been at the lowest it feels like. 

He desperately needs a job to finish school, but he hasn’t gotten a single positive response in months and can’t afford to do much besides staying at home. 

I don’t want to seem like I want to “fix” him a) because he is not broken. Broke yes but no broken, and b) because only him can change his life for the better. 

But can I say or do to help him cope with anxiety and depression? And the feeling of defeated and failure?

My stepmum is suffering from delusional parasitosis and we don't know what to do,5,1.0,1717289284.0,"I recently visited my dad and before coming he warned me that his partner is acting a bit strangely, she sees bugs everywhere that aren't there and spends all day sitting on her bed removing these bugs from her skin and clothes with a pair of tweezers.

We have both tried telling her that the things she is seeing are just bits of lint, and flakes of skin, dust, etc, but she is convinced that they are bugs, and they aren't just on her but on their clothes, bedding, in the food in the cupboards and fridge, on the cat, in the cats ears, and basically everywhere. 

She is on dialysis and my dad thinks that initially gave her itchy skin which started all of this. 

I joined this subreddit to ask if anyone has any experience with this, or can advise me on how we can approach this. She is not interested in seeing a doctor about it, and just says that we all think she's crazy and thinks we are lying to her when we explain that there aren't any bugs.

Where I am right now,1,1.0,1717312072.0,"I’ll start about 2 years ago.

Looking back life was good. I was happy, about to be a senior in high school. I worked hard to get to the point I was at. It seemed like all summer I had something to look forward to, not worried about anything the future has in store. This is about the last time I can say I felt like myself.

Flash forward 2 years, a college student dealing with normal stress and other things. But as I’m writing this right now, I have no self identity. It took my so long to be happy with myself and I have been slowly declining in about every aspect of my mental health for the past year. I feel completely different when I’m with my friends, I don’t even know how to act anymore. I basically lost my social skills, I don’t talk to girls anymore, I’ve lost my ability to make new friends, it’s like everything that was good about me is gone. I’m a completely different person.

I’ve lost all my passions, goals, and confidence. Hell, I can’t even tell you the last time I’ve been in a good mood. It’s like all I do is sit in my room waiting for the time to pass. The only good thing about my days are going to the gym. I have constant thoughts in my head 24/7 it’s like I don’t even have control of my mind.

I’ve always dealt with things such as depersonalization, ADHD and depression, throughout my whole life, although never needed help because it didn’t effect me like it does now.

I really don’t know how serious this is because I guess I’m scared that there really is something wrong with me. 

I could go on for hours writing about more of my problems but this is just the basis. I really don’t know what do to anymore.

Any advice? Everything would help. ,1,1.0,1717311787.0,"Hello, I'm in a turning point in my life, and I'm trying to learn the most i can. 
I'm 29 M, will turn 30 in 3 months. I'm stuck in life and couldn't launch for years I've thought i wasn't good enough as a person but recently I've found out why i couldn't ""function"" as a healthy person the reason is : CPTSD (Complex Post Trumatic Stress Disorder).

That's alright, finally i have a name for whatever was holding me back, objectively i can clearly see i have a lot of good qualities, but subjectively it was clear as the the day that there was something deeply wrong with me, I'm relieved that this can be fixed. 

Right now I'm about to end my mechanical engineering degree, and I'm expanding my social circle by the day, in advance I'm learning about mental health, improving my physical health.

But there is a big problem: This feeling of hopelesness, this feeling of being a failure, this feeling that drains of every bit of enthusiasm for life, i can see it clearly that this is CPTSD but i wish to know something more, some practical tips to implement, I don't want my own brain to sabotage me, i want to control it, not the opposite.

Right now i wish to finally start my career as engineer and find someone to build a life with, inboth aspects I'm very ""behind"". 

Career: It's not about money, it's about earning a decent living while using most of my day in something i don't mind (mechanical engineering). It scares me the idea of not finding a job in this field, the idea of starting over. How do i shake the feeling of everything being useless? And hopelesness? 

Dating: I don't struggle at all talking and approaching women, met 5 women in the last months, 2 are beautiful friends of mine, one is VERY INTERESTED and is clearly trying to initiate everything, others 2 and i didn't click in any way or form. My issue is being very inexperienced as a man, as a lover, the women is interested is 42 and i am 29, she's clearly into me, but I'm not into her, i want to build a family one day and i despise using people as my tools. I'm shitless scared of women my age thinking I'm a weirdo for didn't have dated much. I did live a very socially retired life due to my very bad mental health (7 years depression because of CPTSD has literally devoured my twenties). 

I know very well objectively that i can take everything i want and that there is opportunity out there in both fields but being ""behind"" in both of them drains me so much that catching up is very very hard.
So:
1 Can you give me some practical tips that did work for you or someone you know? Expecially implementing some habits and a detailed info?
2 Have you ever known someone rebuilding a life from scratch in their thirties? Anything you have learned from them?

Trying my best out there, to heal my brain that has suffered this much because of an hellish childhood and to build a life I can finally feel secure and satisfied enough.

"My problems seem pathetic compared to other people's, and they involve me being bad",1,1.0,1717311708.0,"My problems are legitimate in my opinion, but probably not others'. By that, I mean that the problems exist, and that they have a serious negative impact on my life, and that they've done so for over two decades now. But on the surface they seem stupid or trivial or easily fixable. Other people have been dealt much worse hands than I have.

I can't and don't want to go into full detail here, because it'd be long and inappropriate. However theoretically I'd be happy to share the full detail with anyone who might happen to be interested. But I can't just pour it all out in this thread.

I'm 34, and have had serious mental health issues since I was 8ish. Throughout all my teen years and most of my twenties, I was aware of these issues and was always trying to ""fix"" them, despite not truly understanding them. I think I've made progress over the past few years. I forced myself into cognitive behavioral therapy, by going to Uni late at 27, at the other side of the country. Big shock to the system for me. Was entirely outside of my comfort zone, yet a huge help to me. There are various reasons for why I've changed and improved as a person, but a relevant one is recreational drugs.

Ok I'll cut the shit and get to why I made this post. I really like cocaine and am very open and chatty on it, like most tend to be. I feel like since I became a regular user, my sober self has declined in openness and chattiness. I think this is common too. Anyway, I need someone to speak to. I'm always in my head. I'm obsessive, always thinking about every little detail. I need a sounding board for my thoughts. I have no one in my life who can be this. I have family members I live with or near to, whom I used to be very close with, but can no longer speak to, for crazy reasons. I can't speak to my friends about this, as I don't have many left, our relationships mostly exist via WhatsApp, and I can't burden them with all my shit.

So, while high, I booked an NHS appointment with a therapist. While high, I was very open and willing to talk about anything. A therapist seemed like a great idea. But obviously, when the appointment came around, I was sober, and unable to talk. I cancelled the appointment on the phone, at the start of the conversation. I assured her that I was fine, and no longer needed to talk. I work a 9-5 Mon-Fri. I've been banned from drinking while at my house, for no good reason (genuinely). This is relevant because I need the drink to take away the anxiety of the coke. I'm fully aware that this is bad shit for my health. But one problem at a time. Anyway, I'm trapped. I need to find a way to schedule in a therapy appointment outside of work hours, where I'm free to self-medicate with alcohol and coke. I really wish alcohol had no scent.

I'm sure this post makes me look like an idiot, but I can justify everything. I'm not saying I don't do anything wrong; but I am saying that I have honest and good intentions, and that the things I do that are wrong, are to fix an even worse wrong. I'm happy to go into more detail. I'm not sure what I even expect in terms of responses.

I hate myself so much for being such a burden to everyone ,1,1.0,1717308600.0,"I am so stressed about being unemployed, like if I can’t be financially useful then why do I even exist.
I feel like such a burden to everyone I know and love. I can’t do anything, even for simply taking a shower, without feeling guilty. My parents advised me to ask maybe I could ask my friend’s parent if I could work for them but the prospect of that just made me feel even worse, like that’s how desperate I am. I had to get off social media because I was just comparing myself too much to everyone like how tf are you guys going to Disneyland or Europe every summer? I had to stop hanging out with my friends for a while because that would mean I have to spend money I don’t have, I wish everything didn’t revolve around money. I hate asking for money like I’m still some little child asking for allowances. I can’t even rant to my friends about this because it’ll make them uncomfortable, or to my family because it’ll just stress them even more. In my head, every single day I’m cleaning, cooking, or just tasks that I tell myself “I could get paid for doing this” but no one will hire me so I guess I’m just not as qualified as I thought I’d be. It brings back too much old feelings of me hating myself for being so useless and such a burden to everyone and everything. That everything would be better if I was gone, both financially and emotionally to everyone I love. I hate comparing myself to others but I can’t help and not do that, every time I see one of my old classmates post about their travels or stuff they were able to get it makes me think “what makes me less deserving of that kind of lifestyle?”. I do know that everyone only post what people want them to see and that this isn’t reality but I still compare myself. 

Now recently, my father has been hospitalized and that really hit me that my parents health will eventually deteriorate and can’t keep working, I don’t want them to either which makes it even more imperative to work and support them financially. They don’t deserve to live like this and I just want to give them a better life like what they had wanted for my siblings and I. Just thinking about everything just makes me panic and stressed. Like holy shit I fucking hate myself why am I so useless. Money is always at the crime scene for all my problems, I hate it I hate it I hate it.

Periods of low mood interspersed with periods of relative hapiness,3,1.0,1717286472.0,"I don't know how to begin this. It's just that I have had a sort of 'cyclical mood' for a little over 3 years (basically ever since covid regulations were screwed back in my country).

I have periods (a couple of days up to 2 weeks) where I just don't feel good and feel empty. For example i have no motivation to go to class (I'm a 3rd year uni student), sleep until noon and things like that. These periods are then interspersed with periods where I feel relatively happy because something good or nice happened. During these happy periods I always think that during the period when I felt bad, I was exaggerating my feelings. This is also the reason why I never tell people about my mental health. Also because i don't show any signs of bad mental health, people never reach out to me or ask how I'm feeling (i guess people think i have my life together, and maybe it looks like that to them). 

The triggers for these low periods are usually very small/insignificant, for example a situation didn't turn out how I expected or I did something stupid or whatever. Because of this, I start to have these negative thought spirals I can't get out of, resulting in low mood.

This kind of 'cyclical mood' started just after the main covid pandemic was over, when life went back to normal. I just feel like i lost a part of myself during covid. I've always been introverted but i feel like after covid the introverted part of my personality took over. Before covid for example i could have small talk with classmates quite easily, but after covid i feel like i lost that skill. I'm not good at meeting new people anymore. I also feel like my insecurities grew bigger.

Anyway I'll leave it at this because i'm way too tired to type anything extra

Some problems go away for good but most of them come back at one point and attacks my psych once again. Right now It’s probably worse it’s ever been. I’m fighting my mind literally.

Why does my brain hate people but I don't?,3,1.0,1717282505.0,"For context, I really should want to be around people. I was completely socially isolated as a child and was bullied/abused for just about everything up until two years ago.

People are nice to me now, they like me, think I'm kind, funny, etc. but I find my brain scrutinizing everyone and everything they do to try and make them out to be ""bad"". Don't get me wrong, I try my hardest not to listen to this little voice but it's very distressing. I don't hang out with anyone except for one person and my brain is starting to make him ""bad"" too when he hasn't done anything wrong. In fact he's one of the nicest people I've ever met.

I can't reciprocate relationships properly because I'm scared the people are ""bad"" and they secretly want to harm me in some way. It's not just limited to my friends either. I am deathly afraid of strangers. A random man? ""He's probably a pervert/violent/narcissistic"". A woman? ""She's probably rude/vain/abusive"". Anyone and everyone is given a bad label in my mind that I have no control of. I'm aware that not everyone is bad and that makes it even harder. There is one part of me that sees all the good in the world and thinks that everyone is good deep down and there's another voice that straight up tells me that even the best people will want to hurt me in the end.

What are some healthy ways to let out anger?,1,1.0,1717302561.0,"I have three main ways of letting out/easing my anger. 
If it’s something I’ve been feeling continuously throughout the day, when I’m alone I may take a moment to just yell or be overly dramatic about a minor inconvenience. Since I’m alone for those, I avoid lashing out against a person.

If I am angry or frustrated about something happening in the moment, if possible I’ll excuse myself to the bathroom for a moment and just breathe and calm down. Taking away all of the stimuli helps me recenter. If my anger is directed at a person, I may take a moment to write out my unfiltered feelings in the ios journal app. Here, I let myself write pretty harsh things because I know nobody will ever have to see it. It lets me express all of those emotions without hurting anyone. This may also be done in my actual physical diary later on if I’m still feeling it.

Life after depression,8,1.0,1717260184.0,"Hey. I 29F am finally out of depression for the first year in my life, essentially. Since I didn’t have a “before”, I’m basically building my identity from scratch and it’s fucking weird.

I’m forcing myself to do a lot of things and I have so much internal dissonance because of it 😂 like trying to make friends even though it feels like pulling teeth, working out daily which I’m finally enjoying but still resistant to, taking care of my appearance etc.

Is this the right move? Do I, for example, invite this group of strangers on Bumble BFF to drinks tonight even though I would be positively dreading it? I want to “be true to myself” but myself grew up alone in my bedroom all day without any friends lol.

I got dumped last week and the guy indicated that it was because I don’t have my own personality/ I’m kind of boring/dumb in certain regards. He is someone who sees friends literally every night of the week, which I thought was normal, but I realize now is probably just an extreme coping mechanism so he’s never alone. Or maybe it’s totally normal, IDK.

The truth is that I really like being complacent in my easy quiet life. I live better than most kings in history did (a lot of us do). I guess there’s a good chance I’ll regret it when I’m older, but right now it feels so peaceful.

She thinks this because her girlfriend was not answering her phone before they left to drive her back home, which rather upset my friend.

I know better than the challenge her delusions outright, but when she texted me, her suspicions, I was quick to say “I really don’t think so bro, like he really doesn’t like her. If she texted him, he would let you know 100% because he would be mad uncomfortable and desperate for you to make her go away lol” and then “And trust me, you know I would snitch his ass right out if he was doing that lol”

I was happy to see their smiles, but deep down, I wanted to cry. I never got one picture with any of my peers. Very dramatic yes, but it just meant to me that no one care.  I meant nothing to them.

I have just finished my freshman year in college, and still not one friend. Though, it came with more independence, it was definitely easier to manage being at this vulnerable state. What bothers me is I deal with anxiety, fear of what people thought of me, always seeking validation, worried people might judge me from the way I look, act, talk, dress. 

I just wanna know if I will be alone when I die. Will I ever have a wife, start a family, raise my kids? Will I even get married or have kids, who will be at my funeral? Who will be there for me, who will even care about me? Did my existence have a purpose for the people around me? 

It’s just so overwhelming for me because I’ve always dreamed of having a future. People who’ve genuinely cared about me, wanted me for me, people who would sacrifice their time for me, and not use me. I’ve always longed for companionship, someone who I could be able to trust and have a brotherly bond with. But will that ever happen? 

I just suck and I’ve been feeling so down lately. I just want to run away from this life I’m living. This burden in my head is too much to bare, and it has made me gone mad. I observe the people around me, constantly with friends, having a companion by their side, and it makes me jealous. Jealous of the fact that why can’t I have that moment where someone longs for me. No one cares about me, no one loves me, no one would even notice if I was missing. My thoughts are absolutely all over the place, but I am just exhausted and want to go home.

How to handle a job that is tough on your mental health,2,1.0,1717279415.0,"I'll sum it up as best I can... I work on a phoneline where we offer support and resources to people who have experienced discrimination and racism.

Most of the time we have experienced almost nothing but white supremacists calling our line to yell at and insult us. The online negative backlash (replies to posts about the phoneline on social media) is unfathomable and almost entirely negative (extremely racist, insulting, a lot of it containing offensive language in regard to LGBTQ community, climate change, all attacking what they call ""woke culture"").

The effect this has had on me is painful. I pride myself on being someone who can stand up to these bullies and focus on the job at hand but I experience intense panic now when the phone rings, expecting it will be someone who will yell and swear at me when I'm here just trying to help support people.

I'm also starting to feel distrusting of content online - feeling as though I can't enjoy content because what if the individual who is posting it is racist or is someone who believes the awful things I've read in response to our phoneline starting?

Does anyone have any similar experiences as this? How do you practice efficient self care (beyond the general self care advice given from workplace training and just being a human in 2024)?  How do you separate your job from your personal life? The job is also remote which makes it difficult to escape the intense emotions I feel while on the job.

I feel like something is wrong with me but I don't know what is,1,1.0,1717290677.0,"Just a list of things I feel like I struggle with: 

(I can't put two flairs but there is one mention of self harm, just those words though and nothing else)

I feel socially awkward in most situations and feel like I act that way towards other people. I think I have a harder time grasping certain social situations and I find it hard to interpret people's actions and identify what they're thinking sometimes. I do think I can read the room well enough to act normal but I can't figure out whether someone doesn't want to talk to me, or what they think of me. I think this is more of a self esteem issue but I'm not sure.

My own partner pinpointed that I seem to not know my emotions well enough and I agree, I can't figure out what I'm feeling. This is something I've been trying to work out with journalling and just talking about it outloud with my partner and it works to some degree but I still struggle. I also find myself really tired after these conversations and am unable to resume the activity I was doing prior. (A lot of the time, my productivity for the day just decreases by a large margin)

Reading sometimes is difficult because reading material is somehow confusing for me? I find myself re-reading a sentence at least 5 times frequently to process at least half of what I'm trying to understand. Although this doesn't apply to texting haha. It's annoying because I need to read material for uni as well but it's hard, I feel like maybe I just don't read enough in general or something though.

I also feel like I think differently from other people? Maybe not exactly that, but that's the first thought that pops in my head to start this spiral of feeling disconnected from people around me. It's very confusing...I feel a little bit like an alien. I can figure things out like realising how my mom's excited to impress my partner's grandpa with her food because she always seems eager to give him new treats but it's things like this that makes me feel like these ""struggles"" of mine are just attention seeking behaviour to feel ""special"" from other people, and that my issues aren't actually issues. I don't exactly know any examples that can explain this feeling better, but it's a general, constant thought, that I have every other day.

I was diagnosed with mild depression and social anxiety branched out from it about 7 years ago, but I never got treated, and I felt like I was attention seeking enough to trick people into thinking that I did have these disorders. I don't think depression is present now, but social anxiety still is, but these diagnoses feel like they have expired, or aren't very official anymore since it was so long ago. My childhood has also been quite privileged, so I feel as if don't deserve to have the struggles that I do now.

If I were to seek help - I wouldn't know what to tell professionals? Therapists have asked what I wanted to work on, and I didn't know, I just knew something's wrong, and I didn't know how to tell them. I told a GP about my self harm once (neede to go through a GP to get a psychologist here) and I guess they didn't pass that information on because the psychologist said that ""everyone is a little anxious"" and just told me to go and ask my colleagues out for lunch as homework.

A random man saved my life,16,0.95,1717234886.0,"As stupid as it sounds. A random man, in the local corner shop gave me 1 more reason to keep going.

I'm 16. And I've dealt with mental health issues for as long as I can remember. I was around 9 when I began harming myself and I was 10 when I first started properly wishing I could die. I remember being 12 and begging a god I didn't even believe in to take my away in my sleep. It was sad. I was just a kid and I didn't need that. But I'm used to it now.

A year ago I was properly diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am currently going though a diagnosis for BPD. Which is already likely.

A couple weeks ago I had a rough time at school, revising for current exams and struggling with the changes. I found myself having daily panic attacks and feeling an urge to relapse in hurting myself and alcohol usage. I layed off through and managed to ignore it.

I'd had a significantly bad day at school and on the way home I had decided to take my time walking down to the corner shop, which was only 10 mins walk from school. I go there often and it's pretty cheap for energy drinks and sweets and gum. Which is what every teenager in the UK really gets. 

I'd walked in and I was aware my face was sullen and I looked dull. My eyes were red from the tears throughout the day and I was still shaking from the stress and constant panic attacks id had.

I remember I had picked up a small tub of Pringles, a 45p energy drink, and a pack of gum.
A man was in front of me paying, he had a massive basket which was quite funny for a convenience shop.  He also had a young daughter with him, looking around 2 or 3.
I gave her a warm smile as she looked at me and her face lit up. As did mine.
He asked if I wanted to go in front of him because I only had a few things, to which I quickly denied and said it was fine.
I continued waiting and after a minute or so he turned around and asked what I had. Before I could reply he took the things out my hands and payed for them. I stood there dumbfounded. I managed to mutter out a meek ""thank you mate I appreciate it"". He gave me a Pat on the back and told me to go. I smiled at him daughter again and left, walking home.

Unknown to him...but I had planned on stealing a few cans of alcohol and running off into the local woods that night. I also planned on taking something to harm myself with. 
I didn't.
He had made me so unbelievably happy and content that I went home, ate my food, and sat there.

I messaged all my friends about it as I walked back home.
I could've cried again.

How do I prevent myself from getting too attached/hopeful for a potential relationship?,1,1.0,1717290088.0,"25M

I have an unhealthy trend of getting my hopes waaaaay too high when someone I am really interested in agrees to go on a date or two with me. It doesn't happen for every person, but every so often I'll find a girl I just click with immediately. We will usually continue platonically as friends for a bit. In time, we both seem to give good hints towards dating/a relationship and eventually I ask them out. Historically, they have always agreed to a date, but then either canceled the date or quit after 1-2 dates. This is obviously not enough time to warrant my feelings being as high as they are, but I literally cannot help it.

Once I get rejected with my hopes so high, I go through what I assume is heart break. Months of pain, anxiety, depression, 0 interest in dating someone new, etc. This has happened 4 times in the past 7 years.

Everytime I try all of the classic remedies for myself to ""get over it"" but none of them really work. The only thing that works is time (lots of it) and eventually finding someone new who starts the cycle over again.

I post this now because the fourth time just happened to me very recently. I can feel myself spiraling down this same path. It both saddens me and pisses me off. Most people seem to be able to limit their hopes to the level of their relationship, but I cannot. For all other emotions I can regulate just fine, but for romantic infatuation, it's like flood gates. I either hold it back completely and don't allow myself to feel anything or I let it out and run the risk of this spiral if my feelings aren't reciprocated.

As previously noted, this is crazy unhealthy. I also feel  ashamed and foolish to feel this way. I have tried speaking about it with friends and family a bit, but it's clear they just cannot relate, fortunately for them.

Looking down the barrel of this metaphorical gun again has me sick to my stomach and I genuinely don't know how I am going to get through it.

Should I quit my job and go back to my old position?,1,1.0,1717286873.0,"Should I quit and go back to my old job position?

Hi! I'll try to be brief.

I was recently encouraged to try out for a higher position in the same department I already work in. I was super hesitant because I was comfortable where I was at, but applied anyways (because peer pressure) and ended up being hired...but my workload tripled due to being understaffed and my raise ended up being less than 50 cents. That part is entirely my fault, I'm too naive. The only dilemma, other than that, is I am now expected to do a new-hire training biweekly, where I will talk to a small class for at least an hour.

The issue? I have social anxiety. The original job description when I applied made no mention of this duty, I was only informed by a fellow coworker after I submitted my application. And again my fault, I didn't rescind my application, I just went ahead with it. Honestly I kinda blocked it all out in some sort of haze of denial.

Now to where I need advice...this is affecting my mental health greatly, just thinking about the public speaking. My anxiety is something I've worked on all my life, but I am nowhere near stable enough to do a task like that twice a month. Would I be a huge coward if I asked to be placed back in my old position? There are no incentives to stay in my new job. The overload of work, the crappy raise, the presenting....I can't keep doing this. But I don't want to be seen as weak...

To start off, I have issues with my self image. I have trouble finding terms that correlate to me and it feels as if my personality shifts frequently enough to be unable to form a solid answer as to who I am. I feel like a different person every day and I am unable to figure out how I need to act so I typically rely on the person I'm communicating with and picking up parts of their behavior to mimic, because otherwise I will feel as if I am blank and have no response both emotionally and verbally. 

I think another factor is my memory and my thinking abilities. I am generally unable to call to mind most things that have occurred within the last few minutes (especially conversations) without help from someone reminding me. I typically need to rely on triggers such as terms or feelings or my senses to bring back memories, rather than by manually reaching back in my head to retrieve them. 

I also have trouble identifying how I feel within the moment, besides positive feelings because they occur so rarely and noticeably make me mentally feel lighter, as to how I know I'm feeling good. I have trouble understanding how I feel in the moment, and when I'm finally aware it is negative I push it aside to be forgotten or the feeling will vaguely be there in the back of my mind.

Why do I constantly feel like I'm faking my intelligence?,2,1.0,1717270341.0,"Note: I'm not writing this post with the intention of boasting or coming off as pretentious. I believe that intelligence comes in many different forms, and that getting good grades or having a high iq doesn't define your value or worth as a person. I'm simply sharing my experience and seeking insight to what's going on with me.

Growing up I've always been a high achiever. After joining high school, I grew an interest in math, physics and programming. I like things that are stereotypically ""nerdy"", like reading books and playing video games. 
I'm also a very empathetic person and find it easy to put myself in other people's shoes, even if it means sacrificing my own pride.

Here comes the problem, though. Every time I try to pick up a book on science that I've been reading or do anything that society deems as ""smart people activities"", I feel this pang of guilt and voice in my head telling me that I'm just pretending to like these things to seem like I'm better than people. 

I even feel embarrassed writing this post because I really don't think that way, but I feel kind of disgusted at myself whenever I pursue my interests because I feel like I'm not worth it, if that makes sense? It kind of like I'm cosplaying someone that I'm not, even though that is who I am. I just don't feel comfortable liking what I like because due to my race and gender, I don't really fit the narrative of what I think a typical nerd should be.

Worried about being abandoned at social event,1,1.0,1717281228.0,"I have a future social event that I’m worried about. It’s an essentially compulsory event so I have to go.

Before I even talk about this I want to highlight that I suffer with intense social anxiety and would have symptoms almost verging on avoidant personality disorder. I only speak to a few select people because of this and take a long time to speak to and trust others I do not know (I would add that I'm very talkative with people I am comfortable with). I am not particularly jovial to people who I have just met. 

At social events such as socials and parties I tend to end up on the sidelines. I usually end up sitting with the person I went with and talking with no one else. If people do (rarely) approach me I freeze and just answer their questions. I am not like this with people I am comfortable with, I don't have to think about what I'm talking about, I just have a flowing conversation. I am not at all like this at parties etc.

My thoughts during a social event (where I am ignored) are ""why is no one talking to me, am I boring?"". So I don't speak to anyone. It's actually really damaging to my mental health to sit there amongst a group of people chattering and laughing whilst I'm not being acknowledged and am not involved at all. I feel invisible and irrelevant when all of this is going on. During these events my mood gradually lowers and lowers, until I’m feeling sad and depressed. 

I do not get ANYTHING out of these social events aside from food and depression. I always leave feeling deflated and depressed. (I only go out of obligation.) 

Throughout the years I have noticed that most people do not understand social anxiety (I get the impression, most either think I'm stuck up or deliberately acting shy and think that I can just get on with it) they do not try to understand it (or want to) either. So, at these social events it's all on me. If I don't participate nobody talks to me. Because they don't want to make themselves uncomfortable!

So, so far this closed off desposition that I have has been supported by the fact that people don’t generally approach or speak to me. 

As an example, I was recently at a party and most people did not talk to me or approach me. 

This social event will essentially involve me travelling alone and meeting with the group, the first bit of the social event is fine as it’s organised into groups, the second bit isn’t. It’s a meal with tonnes of people I don’t know. I’m literally going alone and will know one or two people there but will probably not even see them.

Because it’s not arranged seating I’m worried that I’ll be in an awkward position and arrive and have nowhere to sit or have to awkwardly ask people to sit beside them. I'm quite worried about having a panic attack. 

I am dreading this social event and don’t want to go at all. I’m only going because it’s compulsory! 

But main worries are being abandoned or put in an awkward position as this is mostly people in their 20’s who don’t care about marginalising someone with social anxiety. I think the worries about being abandoned are intensified because this is a particularly cliquey group of people who will be rolling up in groups whilst I'll be showing up myself. They'll arrange everything together and I'll not know what's going on.

What is the best approach to dealing with this?

Im stuck in darkness,1,1.0,1717279233.0,"Hello, story of the topic is..
7 years ago i was in a situation and i was under prolonged extreme stress and started getting psychotic. And i made some of the biggest mistakes of my life during that time that i regret daily.
I went into total isolation left school, pushed everyone out. I lived like that for 5 years. I lost contact with everything that made me, me. I feel no emotions, no passion, no joy, cant even feel high on wine or weed. I lost my personality, became a shell of what i was, my conversations with people became very robotic and that made me want to isolate myself even more. However..

In the last 2 years of my life i tried to get out of this state. I started to speak to people again even tho most of them found me weird or odd, i still continued to try. I started exercising(swimming cycling and running) Started studying again for university.  I tried having a relationship with a woman and it ended in an absolute fucking disaster, and i mean that literally. Now i kinda feel like i used her just to see if i will feel my emotions again or something.. Also recently danced and kissed with a boy at a party and still nothing. Zero emotions i just acted like what was expected of me during that situation. Now i also regret that.

Tried antidepressants, situmulants,anti psychotic for a short time, theraphy, no progress. Actually i think they even affected me negatively. 

Now, i never had suicide intentions and never tried in those 7 years, still not thinking about doing that. But i just dont know what to do.. Even tho im better mentally than i was 3-4 years ago, i still feel nowhere near to my old self. I still dont feel anything. I even tried to attach myself to religion in the past for 5- months where i gave 2 hours a day for religious activities. It felt fake just like other things. 

I try hard, but feels like im making little to no progress. It feels like im in an endless cycle in this darkness. Maybe im just making things up in my head but i tried not to think about mental stuff and act like everythings fine, didnt work at all.

I can't miss events even tho I am disabled and will push myself to the point of vomiting from exertion to make sure I go to things that loved ones want me to. I will pretend i am perfectly healthy, when i am in fact in a wheelchair with chronic illnesses, so i dont disappoint or inconvenience  anyone. I can't even do therapy because I will pretend I'm cured to make them think they're doing a good job and that I'm not failing them when their methods don't work. I do the same with my psych because I won't admit that the meds aren't helping until I eventually explode and am in crisis from it all crashing down on me and we have to take me off the meds and start over. I hear every noise, every tone change. I simply cannot stand the idea of upsetting or inconveniencing others. I can't watch what I want or play games I want because I want the other people around me to not be bored and so they can use the TV and Xbox. Like everything I do is in service go others. I am exhausted and overwhelmed constantly keeping track of how everyone around me feels and what I can do to make sure they are all happy around me, often hurting myself.  I can't feed or bathe myself and I refuse to ask my husband because he works and is tired and will go long periods of time with my needs not being met to prevent inconveniencing him. He works for 12hrs a day and so I will lay in bed in the dark because I'm too disabled to help myself but will also refuse to ask for things when he is home.

i dont feel like talking to parents because in the end somehow i always am to blame or im told to deal with it and that im not the only one with issues

my parents argue a lot, im the eldest out of my siblings, i do chores and i dont even remember the last time i got something. we didnt celebrate my birthday this year and i was told we didnt celebrate my sister's, but she literally got things for her birthday. my grandma has depression and im pretty sure my mum does too.

we have a money problem and i pay for school lunches with my own money whenever i get it sent so i dont spend it on things i actually want.

so yh, ive been tired, ive lost motivation for most things even as simple as washing my hair. i keep on telling myself i need to yet i dont and i procrastinate. i find it hard to make decisions on my own and i always ask my best mate, and im always self conscious of the way i act, speak, look etc. ig its just living in the uk as a girl. the problem is that i also constantly feel like im annoying people but then i get pissed at my sister easily, so she ends up crying and i always get told off.

I'm 17 (F). I feel overwhelmed by my feelings. Feelings I'm not even sure about. Last year, I fell out with my bsf of almost 4 years. And while I was losing that connection (over a span of I think 5-6 months), I was getting close to another one of my classmates (F) and so she knew about everything that was happening with me and my then bsf. We opened up to each other and she told me about some stuff that happened with her during lockdown. We grew closer and closer and now I don't think I'll ever make a friend who'll be as precious to me as she is. I'm not a very extroverted person, it's really really hard for me to show my emotions without overthinking them and she is the kind of person who just says it. If she thinks you are pretty, she'll say it. And so she is really really good at giving complements as well. So, whenever she compliments me I feel good, like really really good, a little too good. To the point where even if I don't share something, let's say I'm out in a function and all dressed up, with anyone, I share it with her. And like I wait for her compliments. I look for them. And like I keep wanting to hug her or hold her hand, nothing more, absolutely nothing more, just hugs and holding hands. 



Ok, this happened today.
We both went to our school to recieve our marksheets after not seeing each other for 2 months. So she ran and hugged me. Caught me off guard, couldn't react the way I wanted to. But now I can't stop thinking about that. During these 2  months I missed her, really really missed her. And now that we actually met today, I miss her even more, too much. It's overwhelming.

All of them were at a loss as to how to help me, but I will give my last therapist some grace by saying that one of the reasons it didn’t work out was because I struggled with meeting goals during our sessions. I gave up trying to improve in therapy after one particularly rough session and have felt completely demotivated since. I cancelled therapy and am thinking about where to go from here. It’s a combination of not committing to goals, trying to find a therapist with expertise in something that I have that I can’t pin a name on yet, and that I get so emotionally dysregulated from interacting with people long-term that maintaining a therapeutic relationship is a lot for me. It’s been ruled out that I have a mood disorder by people I have seen previously and my current psychiatrist, so I unfortunately can’t take a mood stabilizer to help here.

My mother has always bullied, humiliated and belittled me since I was a child. And now as an adult, it has instilled in a me a deep shame and I see how this experience with my mother has impacted my personality. I used to be so happy, but over the years my personality, confidence and happiness has chipped away at the hands of my own mother. I’ve never had a space where I can fully relax, switch off and be myself without being insulted and targeted. The way my mum treats me has held me back from so many opportunities. I can hear her in my head and she has broken me to have little to zero self belief. I feel like I can never grow in to the person I imagined for myself because I cannot get away from my biggest bully. I am also angry, as I have had amazing internship opportunities that could’ve manifested into well paying jobs that would have enable me to rent independently and escape this hell. However I couldn’t secure these opportunities due to my lack of self confidence. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I am stuck in never ending cycle and are slowly giving up on my self. I feel like I will never move forward with my life until I separate, but I have absolutely no financial backing to do so without securing a well paying job- which I cannot do when living with a maniac.

I am not a lazy bastard. I am not below others. I just don't want to believe this. But I seek out for help, and they just push me in the mud again and again and expect me to get out of this mess on my own. I would like to share some of the things that's bothering me about myself. People who are more informed about these things, please tell me your opinion about whether or not I should be more arrogant about seeing a doctor.

1. I tend to pause whatever work I'm doing at the moment (be it studying, watching a movie, even playing a video game) and stand up to play out a scenario that I created in my head, ideally in front of a mirror, completely improvise a dialogue and then hate myself before going back to work. I started doing this from an early age but back then it was akin to just playing, now it feels like a problem.

2. I tend to remember some topic that was bugging my mind and immediately stop what I'm doing to search about it.

3. I procrastinate a lot, stop what I'm doing to look at youtube or even write some notes like this or do something else like housework rather than focusing on studying.

4. I tend to not be able to keep track of time, oftentimes getting up early to get stuff done and then realize I have done nothing productive when it's 15:00 or something

5. I tend to zone off or think about something completely different and not focus on what I'm doing, and then realize that I was not paying attention and get back to what I was doing, only to do the same thing again mere moments later.

6. I am very forgetful, that's why I list these things down because I'm not able to list them off the top of my head when the situation demands it.

7. I tend to feel left out and behind others when I don't know every detail about a thing that I'm interested in.

8. I tend to dream about horrible scenarios that may happen in the future out of a sudden, worry about things too much and upset myself.

9. I am depressed over the things that I have went through in these last couple of years, and that I'm a failure compared to my peers and I have no hope left for myself.

I'm a normal person with my share of problems and dramas (even though I have a chronic mental illness), I am happy and resilient, I have resources, professional help too. But I'm the kind of person who can easily talk about my issues. I know how to read the room, and I don't share a lot to people I just got to know. It comes over time.

But this is where I ""fuck up"" (temporarily) : I get the habit of sharing with the person ; I'm confident enough to ask for help whenever I need, a bit too confident. I end up being too much. When it happens I just want to talk, to vent, I don't ask for solutions. I also want support, but not so much. At least, that's what I think but I'm just being too much.

I think I ""trap"" people with this.

I have a shrink but they say it's okay. But it's not, I don't want to loose people. I'm 28, I'm not supposed to be doing that again.

Does anybody else feel like this ?,1,1.0,1717261528.0,"Hello, im 19 from the UK and I haven’t really posted or done anything like this on a forum or subreddit? I don’t know the terminology but I’m feeling more and more comfortable with the idea of ending my life. 

For years since I was 14 I was told I had depression and anxiety, the anxiety has went away but the depression has taken up that freedom and over the past 3 years I’ve had a few attempts but the one I got the closest to going ahead with I was caught on my way to the place I planned to do it at and since then ive self harmed, drank heavily and burned a lot of bridges because of my attitude towards life and other people. 

I still always try and make people laugh and make sure others are happy and not alone with their thoughts and in November I had enough of being treated like I was nothing to anyone and had a huge argument with my now ex girlfriend, she got upset and we broke up and looking back at this, I feel stupid for pushing her away but she knew she was not really there for me also even though I made sure she never went a day of being upset without being asked “do you need to get anything off your chest”

There’s a lot of stuff to talk about but mainly: the medications I’ve tried don’t work, the coping mechanisms have stopped working. Self harm doesn’t help anymore, my ex and my friends I miss them and I hate that I even spoke about my mental health issues, if I kept it to myself, I might just have them around me again. I want to end my life and I’m scared. I know people say there’s more to life but I’m 19 and I’m fed up with life. I got to the top and I sunk back to the bottom everytime it starts looking good.

Weird Dream (?),1,1.0,1717261202.0,If ur reading this im just trying to get this out here and after doing research im a little freaked out to say the least lol. Anyways I just had prolly the weirdest dream of my life. It started normal like a normal dream but got worse. Weirdest thing was that I was in complete control of my actions. Today is June 1st and I love footy and if ur a soccer/football fan u know today is the champions league final between Dortmund and Madrid. So bc it is in my dream I am just watching the game and enjoying myself when I notice a super deep puddle on my patio. So being the fisherman I am I cast into it and for some reason my friends dad is fishing with me 😭. Anyways I catch a Crappie and it looks like some random unknown fish so I bring it to my dad. As I get over to him it looks more and more like a Crappie. This was the first weird incident.  Now im back outside watching the game when I see a Massive Anaconda on my shed and I begin to freak out. I tell my parents and brother and they freak out too. Now when I go to call the police all of a sudden there emotions go away. I ask them If i should call the police. No response. I ask them if they see the literal Anaconda! No response. I ask them if im seeing stuff and they all said in unison “probably”. Now im freaked out bc I have full control over my actions and am “fully conscious”. I begin to yell to them to take me to the hospital and that something is wrong with me after more super weird stuff happens where I can just see stuff and they cant and act all normal. I then woke up gasping for air confused when I realized I am fully awake. The weirdest thing is I remember every last detail of the dream. Could this mean something because I red how depression and schizophrenia can have effects on your dreams. I dont have anything going on irl and im a happy person.

id appreciate some friends to talk about this atleast here,1,1.0,1717258821.0,"so i(15f) have been struggling a lot these days. i mean i've always been lazy stuff but this is on another level. i feel like in a moment of a mental breakdown, even if i am scared of death, i might actually harm myself. i'm struggling with ocd for a few months(diagnosed recently) that has been acting up to the point i get disgusted by people too. obviously this led to too many stress to begin with. and me not feeling like i have friends in my new school isn't helping. i go to school, they make mean comments abt me(&other people) thinking they are allll so funny and sarcastic, but it's ruining my days. i like to escape reality with daydreams. in these daydreams i actually live a decent life with decent friends. don't get me wrong, i have some left. but i don't feel like i can talk to them abt this which makes me question our closeness. i don't feel like getting out of bed, dressing up, taking a shower. i'm not depressed or sad tho. but this effects my relationship with my parents whom i've always been close with. just some moments ago my mom was screaming abt how so unorganized i am and how i wasn't gonna get anywhere in life, how she didn't have any problems in life enough that she decided to raise a kid etc. from a simple unorganized room to that. she specifically said how i'd want to go cry abt this to my psychologist(whom I wanted to meet with because of ocd-and only met once this weekend) -andt implied that she was the one that actually needed the therapy. keep in mind that this woman is the ONLY person ive been so close with. we laugh at the same things we love thesamet things. but me being an irresponsible teen and it driving her to mental breakdowns is definitely one of the reasons why i want to disappear. i remember her calling me a bitch in 8th grade just because i wanted to return home from school with my friends instead of her. (i was the one that apologized  after that too) I know i'm not innocent here, but i also don't think a normal parent support on mental health would be too bad. I mean, normal self-esteem problems because no one likes me at school is one thing, but my parent whom id been close to my whole life implying that she'd prefer if she never had me is and more damaging. plus not being able to touch stuff bcs of constant thoughts of them being dirty, cleaning my hands too much that they crack is not helping with my stress. ı just want toddisappear. isnt that valid enough?

idk if therapy is really helping me or just hurting me more,1,1.0,1717258779.0,"i 15f have been going to therapy for maybe 5 months now and idk how i feel abt it. I am not used to talking abt my feelings or what’s going on with me flat out in a none joking way. If i talk to my friends abt what’s going on it’s never a straightforward like “hey im not doing good” it’s usually like “omgg im so tired and i just wanna go home.” Whenever im asked if im ok i never think abt telling anyone no but instead i just say “im just tired.” Tbh saying i’m tired isn’t always a lie though bc truthfully i am tired just not in the usual sleepy kind of way. I constantly am just out of energy to do anything and it affects my attendance in school and my social life outside of school as well. Now for the therapy part. When i was first told i was gonna start going to therapy it wasn’t given as a choice or an option. I was told in a “ur going whether u want to or not” kinda way. That being bc my parents say there is something going on with me and if i won’t talk to them abt it then maybe i need to talk to someone else. Now i think they have the right idea but i don’t think im at a place where the issues im having can be fixed with me going to therapy. I’ve pretty much built up a cemented brick wall about the real issues that i was having. Which would be my parents never listening to me when i was going through stuff and instead just guilting me into thinking that i constantly needed to change. I dealt with and still deal with self esteem issues for a long time because of that. It was definitely worse when i was younger but now i just have the thoughts and feelings abt it now and then. Though anytime id try to say that to my parents (mostly my mom) she would brush it off and not entirely try to understand. Yes, I struggle to say what i’m feeling but she got the message that i was hurting,she just didn’t do anything abt it. I constantly think to myself that she went on and got better but while doing that she left me buried in a hole that i now struggle to get out of. That’s a different story tho. With therapy tho i mostly am just reminded of stuff that i would much rather forget and not have to face. I go through weeks of school basically fine and then after therapy i’m sobbing the whole day and can barely get out of bed, let alone leave the house.

Need advice for suicidal friends ,1,1.0,1717254221.0,"Warning: mentions of blood, self-harm, attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts





Hey everyone I am looking for advice on how to help a couple of friends with their suicidal thoughts/actions. 

Recently one of my close friends had been experiencing a serious decline in mental health and an increase in suicidal thoughts. I try to talk about mental health with my friends on occasion just to check up on how they're going, and recently she has been declining steadily. Originally it was just what I would say is severe depression (very low self esteem, lack of motivation, general feeling of defeat) but has grown to the point where she attempted to overdose on a random collection of pills she found earlier tonight. 

  
I have a lot of experience with suicide. four friends have attempted to commit suicide in front of me, in one case I had to hold the slits on a friends wrist until an ambulance could arrive. I myself have attempted suicide. Yet I honestly have no idea what to do in this situation. It's hard to watch one of my closer friends gradually shut herself off from the people around her. I try to be there for her and offer myself as someone who's happy to listen and occasionally giver her some advice but I'm honestly stumped. i see her at school where she wears long sleeves to cover up her self-harm scars so she won't get judged. I see her back out of formal/prom the night before so she won't have to put makeup over her self harm scars. 

Whilst, at the same time another friend is dealing with his suicidal thoughts. One of my closest friends since we were very little has always struggled with his mental health, but again he has recently seen a decline. He recently broke up with a toxic ex and his mum is a binge drinker that constantly belittles and destroys his self-esteem. He speaks often about ""not caring about himself,"" or ""not caring about what happens to himself."" Once again it's hard seeing someone i care so much about speak to himself about how ""no one would care if he just died."" I'm admittedly less worried about this guy than the girl as he already has something resembling a support network and has yet to attempt suicide or self-harm. But nevertheless it can be hard to balance helping all my friends with their metal health at once. 

I started this post intending to ask for help on how to care for my friends (in particular the girl) and how I should approach the situation, as many online sources just say things like ""speak to a trusted adult,"" ""call the suicide hotline."" Which in my opinion would likely only betray my friends trust and cut off myself as really the only person either of them can talk/feel comfortable talking to about their mental health. But i realise this has turned into a bit of a vent. I want to say that I see a psychologist weekly and am working on improving my mental health. For reference, no one mentioned is older than 18 or has left highschool. We all still live with our parents.

  
Really any advice is helpful/appreciated as the situation at times can be a bit touch and go. Particularly because conversations between my friends and I are often over text.  I'm also asking for help with my friends and not for myself, I know how to take care of my mental health and have a strong support network.

The problem is me being a teenager and very active i have a really fast metabolism i need a lot of food to keep going and i'm trying to bulk right now because even though i am ""strong"" in the gym and run a lot i'm not noticeably big and look average, i'm trying to bulk and i always send my parents grocery lists and i can cook for myself they are not anything crazy i try to go for the more budget options. But my parents almost never buy me the grocery list, the food they eat is low calorie and low protein so i end up slowly losing weight which is what i don't want to happen. My parents don't get me anything for my birthday which is honestly fine but they don't even buy groceries i ask for or if i need something for school i have to beg them for it, i've needed new clothes now for a while but my parents cannot be bothered. This isn't a financial issue as well we live in a good neighbourhood they both have good jobs. My dad always belittles me as well, constantly verbally abusing me and my mum not just for this, she tries sometimes to get me groceries but my dad always gets mad at her  and she is very iron deficient, always tired she cant always help me out. Im struggling to stay sane i really don't know what to do in this situation, i feel like i have nothing in my life going for me i feel so drained of energy i've accepted my reality and i have to live here for at least the next 5 years until i finish university because rent costs are crazy in this country and i have no savings, How do i stay sane for the next few years and what can i do to improve as a person in your opinion i accept im not the best mentally, sorry for the bad grammar its very late here and im stressed out.",mentalhealth,Upstairs_Fix_6681,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d5oep9/parents_mostly_dad_making_it_difficult/,2,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06

Dating when your mental health is wonky,1,0.99,1717252009.0,"Hi. This is never something I thought I would post because I'm 21 (F) and have never been interested in dating. However, I recently met a guy who I think is amazing. I'm not madly in love with him, but whenever I look at him I can't help but think that I just like everything about him from the way he talks to his humour to more minute details like the way he dresses. I don't know if he's interested in me but I feel like we've had great conversations and have had good laughs together and he doesn't seem totally repulsed by me. He even does some things, little gestures, that would make someone believe he's interested by me. 

The thing is, as I said in the title, my mental health is kind of wonky right now. My psychiatrist tends to say I'm in ""denial"", which .. I guess I can't be objective about if I really am, but things are kind of complicated. I drink a lot of alcohol and despite knowing it's bad and it's poison, I really don't feel like stopping, meaning I spend a lot of time either drunk or recovering from alcohol. I also tend to isolate a lot these days because people exhaust me. 

  
I don't know what to do about this. Should I shoot my shot or should I wait, with the risk of him finding someone else before I can potentially be dateable (which I don't know when that will happen) ?

What is wrong with me?,1,1.0,1717251823.0,"I usually have intense negative thoughts out of nowhere and my brain tells me if I do a routine for 3 times that negative thing will not happen in my life.

Example: When ever I come across something negative such as "" a bike accident "" news, immediately I get obsessed with that idea that it might happen to me and in order to convince my brain i do this routine with my hands similar to a prayer 3 times. Sometimes I do it more than 3 times if I don't think that the hand routine was perfectly done and it should always be in ""odd"" number of times. 

I have researched this topic online and I came across (obsessive compulsive disorder), so when ever I have these intense negative thoughts I just tell my brain that ""these thoughts are  due to this OCD thing and not due to the universe trying to plan something against me"", this technique usually works for me sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.

I also have this specific part in my brain that craves for attention from people, when I reasearched my problem online and found out it might be OCD (may be it's not OCD, Maybe I'm just scared) this part got excited because people will treat me in a different way and it likes it.

So i thought since there is a part in my brain that craves attention and likes to be treated different, i might be faking this OCD thing or may be I don't, I'm just confused.

How Do I feel a little bit lighter??,1,1.0,1717249920.0," 

Hello! A bit of advice is needed. So, I am a 20-year-old girl studying computer science  (Putting this out there to invite perspectives that a group might find relatable), and I have been trying to be very productive over the past year and trying my hands in everything I can.

I just finished my sophomore year in college and currently, I am focused on gaining new qualifications and skills for my 2-month summer break, alongside clearing my backlog from the freshman year (Only one subject).  Academically, my performance has been satisfying for me as I got the prize of labore, and things look good if I remain consistent. My family is also doing well. There are some financial and health problems now and then (have always been there) but certainly very well managed by my parents, they are happy and that kind of lessens the worries. I live away from them due to college and it kinda becomes important to be on the lookout for their wellness.

My social life is also fine if we consider that I have a bunch of friends that I can talk to, but it's hard to rely on them. But that's fine too, I got my brother. I did have a massive heartbreak that was difficult to carry and breathe with, but over time many of those wounds have healed. And I am focusing on becoming a better human being. And the domain I am in, I would love to work in that in the future.

Yet, even when everything seems to be very normal and smooth for now, it feels heavy. **When I am done with all my work, I am hit with this overwhelming heaviness, I like to call them the 'Idle Blues',** And I don't like to feel this way. I can't put a finger on exactly why I feel this way or what is it that I want. I just don't like it, it makes me sick to the stomach, almost puking. All I can do is just stare out of the window ( **Sidenote: I am not depressed**), and the only feeling of relief comes from a spark of thought  - *to leave everything behind and run away, to a snowy island where nobody knows me, and start my life from a scratch* in a cottage. Everything feels confusing and void, And I often wish I wasn't around people and in the environment I am in right now.

But then, the blues dissipate. And the blues are not at all scary contrary to what some people might think. They aren't any negative thoughts at all, just a kind of a spectrum between deja vu and nostalgia, but very strong. I don't know exactly what triggers them. And I am back to work again.

I don't know why I feel this way. I really love so many people around me, I will never want to sadden them and leave them alone. Especially my family - my parents and my brother. And I do have a wish to make my lovely father proud and retire him gracefully. And I also cherish my friends, however temporary. I love these people. I love where I am, and I don't want to go back to where I came from.

Does anybody else feel like this too? If yes, how do you cope with these blues, and if you don't cope, then how do you plan to act on these emotions in the future?

I apologize for the long question \^\_\^!!, this is the first time I am asking on Reddit.

She is one of my favorite teachers and has always been really nice so to see her so annoyed at me was horrible. I frantically apologized while crying which was really embarrassing and she said she wouldn't take any points off but that she was really disappointed.

they also get in the way of me focusing on my job (plus adhd), and i typically make small mistakes that build up over the shift. this has all developed over the past year or so, and right now its becoming overwhelming. the nightmares are the worst part. they are usually the most disturbing (would rather not go into detail, they tend to really upset me and are nsfl), and i wake up panicking, covered in sweat and scrambling out of my bed. sometimes i use delta edibles, worst that happens is it replaces the intrusive thoughts with physical anxiety. i dont use them that often though as i dont want to be dependent on it. idk what to do but this is scaring me and i dont know how to tell my parents (they have my insurance info) about this and get checked out.",mentalhealth,Diglis,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d5k915/i_want_to_get_tested_for_ocd_or_something_with/,2,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06

One time some months ago while masturbating I had an intrusive thought of a family member because of a movie associated to incest that I was watching. Since then I’ve been feeling terrible every second, trying to control everything around me to not feel like a creep. Sleep was the only time I was free of it, but lately it has been also visiting in my sleep, and I’m afraid what I felt the other day was basically an orgasm. I was laying down next to that person and I couldn’t sleep and suddenly the said something quietly that I didn’t really catch that sounding like “I’m coming” and I thought again of that moment and how disgusting it is, I wasn’t turned on, at all. But then I felt a really numb feeling down there. I’ve felt kind of similar feeling when having a wet dream, also when having random dreams too but idk. I wasn’t even really asleep. But this whole thing has influenced me so much and this just made things so much worse. I keep reminding myself I’m a terrible person and I’m afraid I won’t look at that person the same that scares me the most bc they are extremely important to me.

Sometimes I really don’t like the way my raw emotions manifest and my behaviour frequently has to contradict that. These are some examples below:

For example, a part of me doesn’t really care if a hot person who flirts with me and gives me attention has a partner. I don’t care about the partner or the anguish they face. The only reason why I do not enable cheating is because it is still wrong to do so regardless of how I feel on the surface. Usually when this happens I end up feeling a lot of anguish and heartbreak even though I will never allow myself to enable their behaviour.


A part of me HATES when my friends ask me for favours, but I always do the favours because I care about my friends and want them to succeed.


A part of me has extremely low self esteem. Keep in mind, the objective truth is that I am an intelligent, beautiful, talented, kind, resourceful woman who has impacted the people around me in positive ways and if I was looking on the outside I would immediately see myself as a role model.

I (26M) have a lovely girlfriend (28F) who I was with for 7-8 months now, but we have only moved together in february. I have noticed in the past that when something bad happened to some of her clothes, she went ""crazy"". No it's not a usual histerica, it's really a traumatic breakdown. Months ago I have discovered the fact that she was beaten by her mom when some of her clothes got damaged when she was a little girl.

Yesterday she was trying to hang some of her clothes and during this process she damaged a beautiful dress. Not so bad damage, barely visible, but for her it was enough. She was crying and I thought it might go away, but it didn't. She hardly communicated, didn't have a reaction to my questions or my touches, hardly I could get out of her that ""It will go away just let me be"" and ""I hate my life"" and ""I hate myself""...

I know (and she told me too) that it started only after this dress damage and she didn't feel something like this before, and she say that ""It's just my thinking it will go away"". But every time I get involved in this so strong that I'm looking for mistakes in me. All I want is to see her happy again.

I have seen something like this before with her but not with this amount of drama and negative thoughts. She couldn't sleep all night, she avoids eye contact, avoids physical touch, answers every 10 minute with 1 sentence. I told to her that I can leave her alone but she did not want.

Is this PTSD? If not, what it can be? If yes, what I can do for making her feel good during her bad ""episode"" , and to pass this episode as quick as possible?

However, I see people constantly misuse psych terms. Which then makes it harder for people who are actually experaincing it. Instead of getting your point across and having a conversation, I see these words be thrown around and shut down any form of communication

Narcissist, guilt tripping, and gaslighting are good examples of this. Just because someone is a jerk doesn't mean they are narcissist.  It's too the point that my therapist said if these words are being said by a person who isn't a medical professional, to take it with a grain of salt. And it's very sad that they got watered down that badly.

Also, these terms can affect people who don't fit in it.  If someone misuses the term psychopath to discribe someone, that person who got called that could potentionally lose relationships, friends.  Because the person who called them that doesn't understand ASPD.

My mom has been diagnosed with ASPD. A lot of people don't believe me because of how overused it got so I have to go into detail about it.

What is it and is it serious?,1,1.0,1717232468.0,"Recentely some of my weird behaviours and thoughts have been getting worse and I don't know if they are normal thus I'm overreacting or there is smt wrong with me and I should seek help.

1)When someone asks me to borrow something, especially my sister. Usually I either don't want to give away this thing bc ""it's mine"" or ""it belongs there and if you take it I'll have to worry all day about putting it back"", and if they don't give the thing back once they are done I get REALLY mad and sometimes even cry

2)I don't like unpacking my stuff from my suitcase bc then I will have to put it back on at the end of summer and if I leave there it's already ready and I don't have to fear I might lose something

3)Caring about how my things are positioned in my room and I HATE when somebody touches smt and I have to put it back in its place, mainly bc it has to be how I like it in my order and bc I'm scared I'll lose these things and maybe somebody (my sister) might take them and I won't realize.

4)When somebody wants to borrow something I might just gift it to them. Once my sister asked me if she could try my swimsuit on, and she ended up liking it so much she asked if she could borrow it and I just said she could have it. Then I went to the bathroom and cried for like a whole 20 mins and even started to cut through my skin with my nails almost to the point it bled. the only reasons I could find are that ""she deserves it more than me"", ""I wouldn't wear it either way bc it's too pretty for me and she's gorgeous so she'll definitely use it more"" and also that ""if I share it then at this point why have it"", I bought for me cause I never dress nicely bc I feel like who I am is just someone who doesn't care and maybe by buying and wearing this swimsuit I could escape this ""false/forced"" image I created and be free.

For the same reason I'm scared of dressing better: I literally wore the same 2 hoodies for the whole school year bc I had no courage to wear anything else and hear people comment (even if in a positive way).

5)Taking things as a form of self punishment and bc I don't deserve things. When I go out with my friends I don't buy anything or try to spend less as I can bc I feel too guilty spending my parent's money, also bc my sister spends a lot of it when she goes out and I fear my parents may not be able to afford another child who does this. Additionally when we're on a trip I always compare what my sister buys in total to what I bought and always hope I spent less money mainly bc if I spend less I know she can get what she wants bc after all ""she wants it"" and I should sacrifice some of my joy for hers.

There’s Always a Reason: possible TW,1,1.0,1717225691.0,"2 years ago I (25F) almost killed myself. Very closely might I add. Close to 3 feet from driving off a mountain side. I was going through a very rough custody battle. My son’s (4M) father (26M) threatened to take my son away and not let me see him. For 2 weeks I was begging him and his wife (25F) to let me see him. During this time I went down a dark path of drinking, getting blacked out, not remembering anything from the previous days and nights. I drove and drove, didn’t pick up my phone for anyone, went MIA. Going over 50mph down washboard dirt roads I thought that night would be my last. With tear clouded eyes, windshield dappled from the rain, I couldn’t see well. My car spun out on a sharp curve I couldn’t correct my steering and at that point I didn’t want to. I let go, let off the gas a bit and prayed I’d drive over the edge. My car hit a berm and I hit the brakes. My head bounced off the steering wheel and all I saw was black. Over the next few weeks I started remembering what happened that night. Some things are still blurry. But I now know something had their hands in my life. Wether it be the thought of my son not having his mom in his life, or one of my past relatives I know that night was a blessing for me. Im alive and I have my son. I will never take my life for granted. I love everyday I get to spend with my son. I’m sober now. I don’t have the career I’ve dreamt of, but I don’t need money to love my life. You always have something to live for. 2 years ago I hated my life. 2 years ago I could’ve been 6 foot deep. 2 years later, I love myself, I love my life. Look to the future, you have your whole life ahead of you. It’s taken me 2 years to come to terms with what happened and to let it off my chest. It will always be apart of me, I accept it as I’ve accepted every traumatic event that has happened to me. The scar I have from this, and everything else will always show, I show them with confidence that I have survived through my worst of times.

"Always there for friends, but left alone when I need support—what am I doing wrong?",1,1.0,1717224580.0,"I’ve been struggling with a recurring issue that’s really starting to affect my mental well-being, and I’d appreciate any insights or advice.

For some context, I have friends who typically don’t stay in regular contact but reach out when they need help. I always try to be there for them, prioritizing their problems and even offering future advice. However, when I find myself in need of support, they often become unresponsive or, in some cases, have blocked me after their immediate issues are resolved.

This pattern has occurred several times, and each instance leaves me feeling more isolated. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even escape these feelings at work anymore. I used to immerse myself in my job to avoid thinking about these issues, but now, these thoughts seep in, making me feel guilty as if I’m somehow responsible for their reactions. This has made me question if there’s something inherently wrong with how I approach relationships.

I was taught that as a man, I shouldn’t show vulnerability or cry, and I should just “bear” the pain. However, suppressing my feelings is becoming increasingly difficult. I feel used and ignored, which leads me to think that perhaps I need to change something about myself.

Has anyone else experienced similar issues? How do you cope with feeling used or handle one-sided friendships? Any advice on setting boundaries that don’t result in lost friendships or how to communicate effectively about your needs?

someone who is mentally unstable, she didn't really seem to understand.

I have just realized that I am the abuser in a trauma-bonded relationship. What should I do?,1,1.0,1717221624.0,"I, M, 34, have just realized that I am the abuser in a trauma-bonded relationship, a friendship.

What should I do?

Should I leave my friend with immediate effect so as to protect her while I get help?

Also, what are my chances of recovery? This has been a friendship where we keep splitting up and coming back together. The gap between the split up and the getting back, ranging from a few months to a few years.

The trauma happens when we are together, and we usually back together for about a few days to a few months before we again part ways.

The primary reason for our conflict is the different ways we look at ""meat"", morality and meat. You know the usual stuff, suffering of animals, pain of animals, religious symbols associated with it. I am a Hindu, so the cow is holy to us. She's also a HIndu, but refuses to see my side, and consumes beef, and it really tears me apart.

For some context: I have a nasty UTI again (still?) so my ability to hold is even worse than usual. I usually have a little control but often wet myself because it gets urgent fast. Now that I'm battling this infection, it has gone to almost 0 control. I'm literally wetting myself and I don't feel it until my diaper is soaked. I have no pain with the infection itself btw...it's silent, as it usually is, for me. Yes, I AM wearing protective briefs as I have for months now. 

Why am I so upset? I leaked all over the chair...all over the back of my pants...I'm not soaked bc the diaper caught most of it, but yeah, I am wet...and everyone saw the puddle (small) on my chair. The therapist is like you ok? I'm so embarrassed. I'm dry-ish now (pants are still wet but I'm in a dry diaper) and humiliated. This is a VERY non-judgemental environment so it happens a.d I'm not actually the 1st. I've been here in this Program so long that I've seen pee, poop, vomit, snot...it's like raising children again for real.

Not sure what my symptoms mean,1,1.0,1717217074.0,"Hello I’m just posting here because  I have a bunch of symptoms but I can’t determine if i’m sad or depressed or idk anymore.

1. No energy ever. I wake up tired, i go to bed tired, i’m tired while doing homework,
i’m tired while at the gym and i try and to sleep more by staying in bed and taking naps but it doesn’t help.

2. Insanely messed up sleep schedule. I can’t sleep until after 3 hours of being in bed consistently. I always go to bed around 3/4 in the morning and end up missing class a lot of the time at 11;30. 

3. Severe social anxiety. I rarely go out in public unless it’s after midnight and i know no one will be there or i absolutely have to go to something. But besides that I stay in my dorm all day everyday and only leave for class occasionally and the gym. I just can’t function in public and going to class is just a struggle by itself.

4. No motivation at all, ever. Everything i do is by willpower alone. I have to will myself out of bed in the morning or afternoon as of lately. I have to will myself to do my homework. Everything seems like a task now and I can’t even do the things I enjoy anymore without wanting to get it over with and go back home.

5. Dirty room. I recently failed room inspection and I honestly can’t bring myself to clean my room. I have clothes everywhere records, laying around I have clothes everywhere, stuff on the floor, trash everywhere, food containers. it looks like an explosion happen in here and I just can’t bring myself to clean it because it’s just so much and I try to take it slow and do a bit by bit, but it’s just insanely hard and I just can’t do it. 

6. Physical appearance, I can see my face deteriorating. I have eyebags that are visible and it looks like I’m a zombie. Well, I have been going to the gym consistently and I have a good physique. It doesn’t matter because I lookdead and I feel dead all the time too and I think people can notice which makes me feel even worse.

7. I don’t want to talk to anybody. I don’t be answering calls, I don’t respond to text messages, I don’t go in the discord call with my friends anymore, I’m just always alone and on Instagram or TikTok. I uninstalled the apps and I’m trying to cut back, but I don’t know how to feel. I try to be a nice person. I hold the doors open for people. I wait the elevator. I try to help people out, but I just feel so empty and I don’t want to talk to people usually. 

8. Isolation, I am constantly isolated. I don’t talk to anyone mostly throughout the day as I stated I only talk to people at class or when I have to do something, but usually it’s just me alone in my room. When I go to the gym, I don’t really talk to people there too. I think they know too, so there’s lowk no point.

9. Anger. sometimes I just get angry or irritable for no reason the littlest reason I have little patients now and my attention span is definitely shortened. I can tell I know this is from apps like Instagram and TikTok but I just can’t stop. I mean I’m stopping right now, but I might be back on the apps. 

10. I just don’t know how to feel sometimes. Like sometimes I’m just empty like for example today I was just driving around with just listening to an audiobook you know just not thinking at all just I just felt empty completely empty. Like I can’t even describe how I felt. 

I don’t know anymore. I feel like I’m just going through motions at this point. ",mentalhealth,_Pentagram_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d5f3lg/not_sure_what_my_symptoms_mean/,0,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06
"My GF has ocd, I need advice ",2,1.0,1717203043.0,"My Girlfriend and I (both 20 years old). Have been dating for 3 years now. We've had our ups and downs since we started dating so young, but it's been good overall.

However, she started having ocd about our relationship, almost a year ago it started. Some refer to it as ROCD if you are familiar (relationship OCD). I think this is because I broke up with her when we were young and it was kind of out of nowhere. Then we got back together but it started this whole thing and somehow developed ocd through that, but that's besides the point....

The point is, it's been a bit of a rough time lately. Her ocd targets things about me. Like my hair isn't the way she likes, she hates my beard, she hates my style, she wishes I was more ""preppy"" or sometimes she thinks I am weird. Now I find comfort in knowing that this is all ocd. I have always been a ""societally attractive"" person and she has always found me very attractive. Until now of course, especially when her ocd flares up.

This is what I need help with - I don't know how much/when to give in to her ocd, and when I should not give in.

For example. She begs me to get my haircut like I had it when we first met. She said she only finds me attractive that way and it's really hard for her when she's not attracted to me. Which I totally understand, anyone would feel that way. I have fought her on it for a while because I really like the way my hair is now. I've told her things like no you aren't supposed to give in, once I cut my hair you will just obsess about something else. But she insists it will be much easier for her to deal with things when I cut my hair and she is more attracted to me.

So finally I did, I cut my hair the way she likes it, today actually. And she was grateful but she is still freaking out over my beard. She really wants me to shave it. She wants me to shave it now. So I came here to ask, do I shave my beard and do that for her, or is that too far and I am just giving into her compulsions? (I really don't want to shave it)

I normally have a pretty good balance with these things, but this particular one is hard. It makes me feel like it is not okay at all to do this for her and that I am giving in to her ocd. But at the same time, she says this will genuinely help her, and that it's easier for her to battle ocd when she's attracted to me.

Am i normal or what?,1,1.0,1717216321.0,"Idk what's exactly I'm feeling right now but i feel normal today compared to a part of myself during my childhood, it's like gaining a consciousness that 100% in my control.

Unalive them by drowning or smashing it to the floor, and it's pretty much fcked up. But then again, if i remember correctly at that time, i neither feel any guilt nor gaining any pleasure doing it. It's like a curiosity of mine to did all of that.

If i self diagnose myself today, i would say that I'm the kind of person who intolerant towards anything graphics, hate violence and pretty much emotional beings and always prefer to resolve any conflict verbally before it turns into physical confrontation. Today me is better in judging what's right or wrong but with a stong influence to have an understanding regarding the context of the topics beforehand before making a conclusion.

I need advice on how to move forward. ,1,1.0,1717216221.0,"Usually, I would never post on Reddit. However, I really need some advice.

I've been dating this girl for a while. She's the sweetest person. 
I'm so happy to be in a relationship with her, and everything has been so great. 

Now, I have trouble with my eating habits. 

As a kid, I was a little heavier. A year into middle school, I dropped the weight. 
However, over time, I've developed a fear of gaining weight. I've had periods where I didn't eat properly out of fear. (I'm a totally normal weight, not overweight by any means.) 

This wasn’t too bad.. Until last week. I organized a meet up with my girlfriend, and this meet up was for today. (Time of posting) 
It's summer break for us at the moment. 

Now, my girlfriend is gorgeous. I mean, stunning. She's beautiful, inside, and out. 
I always want to look my best around her.

A few days away from the meet, I looked at myself in the mirror. 
I couldn't see myself clearly. 
All I could see myself as, was a slurry of awful things. 
And, I stopped eating. 
I'm not exactly proud of this, but I stopped eating all the way up until the meeting. 

Everything went wonderfully, and the meet up was great. 

Now, me and my girlfriend have this thing we do.. We ask each other for the first thing that comes to mind. 

She asked me after the meet up.. ""First thing that comes to mind? ❤"" and I threw out a few thoughts, including a ""skip"".
She begged me to tell her, and I eventually caved. 

So, after much resistance, I told her. I told her that I was sorry, and I even promised to never do it again. (She knows I take promises seriously.) 
She cried. She begged me to never do it again, she begged me to stop with the habit.

She went as far as comparing me to an old mutual friend of ours. One who caused my girlfriend a lot of pain.
Saying that she'd do what she did with her if she had to, and ignore me until I ate. 

And that's when tears rolled down my cheeks. 

I never wanted to be a burden on her. 

I told her I was going to go for the night, as I was exhausted, and we exchanged an “I love you”.

Now I'm writing this, crying. I feel horrible, and I'm so unsure of what to do.

I just need some advice on how to move forward... I've hit a very low point, and I'm worried I might do something irrational.

Please, advice?

i started freaking out because while so much time has passed, i've barely been doing anything (i have exams to study for and my postgrad started in a few months). the fact that i couldn't even remember the few productive periods of time didn't help. 

i spent an hour going through my journals, habit tracker, and even text messages to see what i'd been up to. it helped immensely and i wouldn't have been able to calm down for a while otherwise. i am currently in the process of making a detailed document about the past half year. 

i started experiencing these kind of gaps in my memory after depression. at first, it was just blocking out negative experiences, but it's starting to feel more and more like i can barely remember things in general. it really sucks because....i would ideally like to be able to remember my own life experiences for better or for worse.

neighbors slam doors and it keeps freaking me out,2,1.0,1717201432.0,"hello!

the way my apartment complex is built, you can hear basically everything in the breezeway outside because it is super echoey. in addition to this, the doors don’t close unless you put force into it so some neighbors will slam their doors which echoes in the breezeway and is reverberated throughout my living room.

Infestation causing a breakdown,1,1.0,1717214370.0,"I am diagnosed with both depression and anxiety.
When my depression got really bad last year, I didn’t clean (especially when it came to doing laundry) for months. When I finally got up and cleaned up and did laundry, I realized I had a carpet beetle infestation.
At first, I’d see larvae beneath furniture in my bedroom. On average, I’d maybe see 5 per month. 

A few days ago, I started seeing adults. I’ve seen 3 so far, and started seeing larvae in other rooms, which freaked me out cause, in my mind, the bedroom was the only affected area, so the other rooms were kind of like “safe spaces” away from the beetles.
I know they’re harmless (other than messing up furniture or clothes), but they are ruining my life.

I get my partner to inspect every item of clothing or towel I’m about to use, every single day. I can’t tell if I’m seeing them fly around or if I’m hallucinating. I’m constantly feeling itching everywhere even if there’s nothing there. I even started hearing sounds that aren’t there.
I’m terrified all of my belongings, especially those that have emotional significance, are infested. I feel like I can’t relax in my own home, and I never feel clean, no matter how often I shower.

I haven’t found their “nest” yet. I want to do a massive deep clean and try to find where they’re coming from, but I’m terrified of it. 
I don’t know how to deal with this.

Any ideas as to my cousins behavior?,1,1.0,1717203542.0,"Can someone help point me in the direction of what kind of disorder my 34 year old cousin has and if there'sanywayhe can he helped? I'm hoping if I know what area to look into, me and my family can try and help him. Since all of our collective efforts have failed thus far.
My family has a good share of mental illness. From schizophrenia,  bipolar 1 and 2, anxiety,  depression,  etc. So we're no strangers to mental health and openly discuss it without judgement. 

He never calls, texts or responds to anyone. He lives on the computer in his dad's spare bedroom. He refuses to work a job or have any social life.

He lies constantly about literally everything. EVERYTHING!

If you try to have a conversation with him, he acts dumb so he can get out of talking with people.

His only emotion when his mom (his previous life long care giver died) was happiness he got 9k. Which he spent all on games. His mom literally died in excruciating agony in front of him, due to a genetic condition. He shows complete indifference.
It's scary.
If you ask him for anything, even a napkin or what time it is he starts simmering into a rage. As though you're wasting his time.

My uncle feels like he's trapped in his bedroom to avoid his 34 year old son, because of his son's rages.

My cousin has impregnated a few women and run out on all of them. Signing away all rights, while getting angry the women won't “just get an abortion or stop f'ing around”. 

His younger, estranged brother says he's either a narcissist or psychopath, “maybe even both”

It's bizarre to see because up until 17 he was always nice, normal and independent.

Now he literally owns 2 shirts, and 1 pair of pants. All given to him and won't do his own laundry or make his own food. He won't help his dad with anything, not even when his dad had a broken leg would he help bring in groceries. He said that was his dad's problem, not his. Even though he eats most of the food his dad pays for.

He claims everything like working or communicating waste his time. When all he does is sleep and play computer games.

He brags he's the 5th best player in the world on some online game.

Of course he claims there's nothing wrong with him, and got offended I mentioned mental health services. Literally talking down about our family having healthy expectations, and understanding of our conditions. 

What on earth is going on in his head? This behavior is so baffling. 

I've never met someone so negative and terrible. My family worries he might hurt or k!ll his own dad with his rages. Without his dad he would be homeless! But he doesn't care. It's heartbreaking to see after my uncle just lost his wife of 37 years! 
It makes me mad because my uncle has a mental health condition and has always taken care of it and now we're seeing less and less of my uncle which is concerning because my uncles the life of the cook outs and now ""never feels good"" and won't go anywhere but to work.

Mental illness ,1,1.0,1717200963.0,"My Dad was diagnosed with schizophrenia at maybe 20 -24 years of age somewhere in between 

It's now 50 years later and he takes medication in the inform of injection 💉 every 2 weeks which works well 

I am a 100% sure his behavior most of the time is not schizophrenia related, I know exactly by living with him for 20 years when he has mild schizophrenia (or something else) symptoms , ignore the label schizophrenia let's call this diagnosed x 

Diagnosis X i understand  , symptoms we understand is kinda out of control and he will be better tomorrow 

But there is a Diagnosis let's call it Diagnosis evil, here I know from everything from facial features to body behaviour this is him totally aware of everything, one can say symptoms pass as normal mental state , awareness , any adjectives can be used with the objective off 

In evil mode , it's  Consistently, timed , we know how he will be evil

Let's try real examples 

I know my mums birthday is on day X and every day X of every year I consistently fake like I'm sick , objective is to spoil the day and  avoid doing anything that can make her happy or anything that will require his effort 


Real example  2

Mum got sick , ok perfect timing to act sick so I don't have to go to the chemist to get meds or be of any help like making tea consistently 

Real example 3

People visiting to socilise where my mum will enjoy the visit but not him , consistently try and act i got X to get that person  to leave , or feel unwelcome , say something to make sure no social connection can be made as to avoid bringing  happiness to her 


Flip any of these events around , buy here he gets benifit from it , something out  of it , he will be perfectly normal on the day 100% certainty 

Symptoms evil happens consistently to any random scenario consistently for the day, repeatable and timed  , where it's known it will bring happiness to mum or if the scenario in question would involve him putting in any effort, like going to shop , helping in any way 


These evil occurances are so consistent and timed I can with 100% certainty predict it , or create a scenario to induce it , 

The exact same scenario above if changed to give him benifit of any kind , I can with 100% accuracy predict he will be normal and also create a scenario to induce him to be happy 

If in evil mode , let's say he has to do task Z , I know he will never do it , add in incentive do task Z and I'll give you R300 , he will do it 

I know evil mode and X mode 

I'm X mode , nothing can be done. here is actually really sick ,

I am about to be 40 in a couple weeks and I feel like I do not know myself anymore... I used to feel happy, excited to go out and get dressed up, I was creative... loved being around people... etc etc.. I could go on and on. Well, I have had a rough 5.5 years or so. I lost my mom to cancer in 2018, then my fiancé (then BF) had a really bad finger accident, then the pandemic, and I could not travel to see my dad for almost 2 years. Then, we lost our dog during our home remodel which was FROM HELL...1.5 years of it.  
I have been in therapy for a while now. Can't say if it is helping or not. I have tried other modalities, too, like hypnotherapy, RTT and some others. Nothing has helped me much. I started on a low dose of Zoloft last year but I found it was making me reallllly tired and I gained a bit of weight. Now I am on Wellbutrin and I truly do not find it to be helpful at all. In fact, I feel angrier but I am not sure if that is because of the compounded effects of all the stressors in my life?? I have lost ALL motivation. I own my own biz and I just come in and sit here like Groundhog Day. Not productive. I used to be excited to take photos of the new items and post them. I also feel like when I look in the mirror I hate what I see. But do I do anything to change it?? NO... because I feel almost like frozen in a way? I find that all I want to do is go home and watch TV. I have been taking anger out on my fiancé which is not good obviously. I also feel like he has a lot of grief from the remodel and has some health issues due to covid so we are both messes..

I struggle with food so much it is making me wanna cut myself ,1,1.0,1717200337.0,"Hey, 

I was doing a little bit better. And not gonna lie it was really nice that it seemed to get better. Sleeping went better and eating went a lot better. Which was pretty unheard of for me. i actually lost some weight which was really nice for me as i am severely overweight. I weigh in at 115 kg's at 180 cm tall. I give diving lessons and go through quite a lot of air and wanted to quit smoking just so i could dive longer. Also cancer sucks and having to spend a fuck ton of money to get it doesnt help. So i quit last tuesday. It is whatever, i dont like it but the other times ive quit i went balls to the walls crazy from missing nicotine. So now that is doable i wanna keep going you know for diving. I do really struggle with eating the last couple of days. i thought my intake was enough but it wasnt that great if im honest. It is 2 am for me now and i am going insane cause of hunger. I already overate tho. I had chips, nutella, a bunch of protein bars and more. It is such a big struggle that rn i just want to cut the shit out of my arm so i wont be tempted to eat. I hate that we as humans come across food multiple times a day. That we find it everywhere around us and i hate most of it that it is so addictive. The only reason i thought of keeping on smoking is so that i wont gain any more weight. I can barely look at myself in the mirror rn as it is. I really really really fucking hate it. I need to find some form of peace with this struggle cause there are weeks where it is taking over my life. I thought i had it guys i thought i was okay and doing better but rn i just wanna die and be done with this.

But then i get verbally abusive then physically either to myself or something else, I wont go into detail but my brother did something embarrassing in front of guests and i got really physical afterwards. 

I felt guilty and i just wanted to apologize but the damage is done and he will probably never forgive me or trust me the same beforehand. Just before I only was physical to myself and objects but never people and I wasnt like this for around a month, this was my breaking point and caused me to write this.

so to start off, im a lover girl, or so i think? like im the type of a person to get really into any relationship, whether its platonic or not. the idea of giving others anything they need and caring for them is just extremely nice to me, idk.

i only had one boyfriend, and it was an online one, and as i said, i tried really hard to do my best in the relationship, but well, he didnt, so i broke up with him. because it was an online relationship i didnt feel too attached and his lack of effort to change made it easier to end things.

in any friendship too, im always trying to do my best, although especially lately its been quite hard (possibly because i just graduated and my friends have jobs, so its harder for all of us to meet up and talk in general.)

fast forward to now. while im usually a sucker for a relationship, i want to be in one and all, sometimes i get this... overwhelming feeling that i actually dont want anyone. that i want to be left alone by everyone, the thought of someone talking to me makes me feel a bit... disgusted, even? i dont know. it just feels wrong and uncomfortable.

it passes with time, but it still bugs me. i know i need therapy, and as soon as i get a job ill go, but i just thought that maybe someone here had an idea on why is it like this?

ill also add that sometimes i get like this because im in my summerhouse, to which im going to tomorrow (a lot of trauma from that place, so it makes me feel horrible) so it may be caused by that, as well as my mother cheated on my father (and her mother, on her husband too, so its kinda like a generational trauma maybe??) so maybe its trauma from this..? but im really not sure. id appreciate some help :>",mentalhealth,Jealous_Author_4346,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d59dx0/i_feel_weird_about_relationships/,0,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06

since that time till few months ago i was telling myself that it will be better once i started working. Although, as i mentioned before, i got a job in a respectable firm but the thougts are relatively same, i realised that its not even somewhat enjoyable to work (i do recognize that work is not something you enjoy no matter the work, however not even once i felt happy in the workplace). it is not that i am incapable as well its just that it feels grim and i feel like im being pulled to a meat grinder, so i started to lose my will to move on honestly. 

i cant start over as well, because my countrys economy and living standart does not allow ""starting over"" easily. so i feel like i am stuck in a body that chose this path because few years ago i wanted this. i dont know what to do or what to feel other then dread and i feel like if i cant change this, it will end bad since ive already thought about suicide once.

"I have a question about loneliness, more on the psychological side of things. More details are in the post.",2,1.0,1717179930.0,"This may be the incorrect Reddit for this kind of post/discussion, but I wasn't sure, so hopefully the mods will let me know. Also sorry in advance because I'm not very good at formulating thoughts without being overly wordy, but hopefully it's not too bad.

---------

So I have struggled with loneliness in the past during extended periods where I lacked a heavy amount of responsibility, besides the basics. It just shocked me because I didn't even notice it until I was on a walk today when normally it would impede me from being productive almost every day.

I'm a college freshman right now and I've just begun my summer semester, and there's a *ton* of work to do. But, to the point, I'm noticing that while I'm focusing on all my work and doing pretty well IMHO, I almost never have depressive feelings due to loneliness or basically anything. It just shocks me because it usually impedes me from being productive almost every day, and I know it's a huge issue for many people.

But nothing has really changed, though. I've not made any new friends and I still talk to my parents the same amount as I usually do. Is it legitimately all in my head whenever I do go through these periods of depression due to lack of socializing, and do I just need to find something and focus all my attention?

I'm really wondering this because it will help me later in life, knowing I have a, at the very least, makeshift solution to getting rid of these annoying feelings. Assuming socializing and 'having community' is a non-negotiable prerequisite for being happy...

(obviously, having community would be better, but not having it won't make me wholly miserable either)

...my happiness (or, more accurately, fulfillment in the present moment) is variable and not within my control under this definition because, ultimately, I can't make people my friends.

I honestly do not know what to do. I think I have yet to go to a party where I can enjoy myself and not take care of someone. Please give your opinions or thoughts on my situation so I can try fix it.

Thanks.

I'm turning 40 this year, and have a long history with alcohol.  I've never been mean, or violent.  I eat healthy, workout regularly, and enjoy learning on my free time.  I'm mad I haven't read in a while haha

But my gf's question lead me down a line of thinkingI realized as a child I was always rewarded for tolerating pain.  And when I think about the ""macho"" culture I grew up in, you were the ""coolest"" if you could party all night. And get to your 5-6am job and excel.  In general, I don't ""drink, or party"" the way I used to. But this passed holiday weekend I hit it pretty hard.  My gf told me ""I don't know how you drink like that and hit the gym as soon as it opens"".  

My body always hurts. But I ignore it.  If I was being honest with a doctor right now I'd probably get sent to the emergency room. But I have a life time of training myself that ""I'm fine"".  If I were to sht out my intestines, cram them back inside me, and still have the charm to convince people I'm ""cool"", I wouldn't be surprised.

How do I train myself away from this thinking? It helped me survive in my 20's and early part of my 30's.  But now I'm approaching 40?? I feel it, I see it.

It’s my birthday and I lost everything today,37,1.0,1717118218.0,"I’m not one to typically get sad. I put so much effort into everyone and everything around me. 

I went into work today and was told to clean my desk, fired. 
I went home and fell asleep, then I had an appointment at a community college to register again. They told me all of my credits from HS and my preliminary courses have to be retaken because I’ve been out of school for 5 years and they don’t count towards the degree I wanted. I never heard of this. So now I have to start over. 

On my way home from college my tie rod on my car somehow broke and had to be towed away. 

I typically don’t mind how many happy birthdays I get for each year but so far, not a single person said anything to me. I just think on top of some major stressors I dealt with today, it’s a cherry on top.

depressed girly with little support for meds,1,1.0,1717188589.0,"So I have really bad depression, it's always been bad ever since I was in maybe elementary or middle school and it has not really gone away. I do talk to my therapist monthly and my depression has been getting worst for some reason. It's gotten so bad that my therapist was telling me to consider taking meds. 

I myself am not really against taking medications but the people that I'm around and frequently talk to are not supportive and give me a hundred different options that they say I need to try. This includes my boyfriend which I didn't fully disclose to my therapist but she sensed that I was hesitant due to other people's opinions, experiences, and viewpoints. And as much as I appreciate other people's perspectives and such it just makes it difficult for me to decide what to do because my depression is only getting worst and everything else I've been suggested by my therapist hasn't worked. 

The opinion that is making it difficult for me is my boyfriend since he has literally seen how my depression will destroy me at times. He has stated that he feels like any meds I take will make me into a zombie or vegetable and he said he doesn't want to see me that way. My therapist reassured me of such claims though by letting me know that I need to say something if things don't feel right (if I decide to take any meds). She said sometimes people think its supposed to feel zombie like and everything but that it's not. She said there are different types and everything and that sometimes a particular medicine isn't for everybody. That helped me feel better about if I do proceed to take anything but I just wished I didn't feel so ashamed or embarrassed that I've gotten to a point where I have to consider taking medicine for my depression.

"Is this anxiety, people pleasing, or something else?",1,0.99,1717188023.0,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to get your opinion on something. I think I’m an anxious person overall and sometimes quite sensitive. I saw a video on TikTok earlier this week where a guy was talking about how he doesn’t like having friends who are people pleasers. For the past couple of days, I’ve been trying to figure out if I’m one of those people. I understand that people-pleasing can be a manipulative thing, even if it’s unintentional. I also know that I wouldn’t necessarily like friends who are “fake.”

Let me give you an example: I’m in college, and a classmate approached me because he wanted my contact information. I gave him my Snapchat at the time since I was more comfortable with that than my phone number. He wanted to be in a relationship where we could sleep together in the dorm sometimes. No shade to him, but that’s not what I want because I prefer to wait for marriage. He was annoyed, and I felt a little bad, but I honestly didn’t care too much afterward because we wanted different things.

On the other hand, I almost got scammed once by a company that seemed very legitimate. I gave them personal information because I didn’t want to seem rude by hanging up. Eventually, I called them back to say I wasn’t interested and asked them to delete my information. They were a little pushy, but they eventually complied.

Sometimes I stay later than I want to on campus because my friends are doing something. I say yes because I don’t want to seem selfish, but sometimes I do say, “maybe next time,” because I want to get homework done or I’m just not in the mood or not feeling well.

I’m not sure where this puts me, and I’d love to hear what you guys think. I’m not an expert, so any helpful advice would be appreciated. Thanks so much!

I saw how there was basically no love between them. My relationship with my family and brother is kind bad because I know they love me but it doesn't feel right and I don't really like them but at the same time I do because they are my parents. My brother also became an hikikomori (he will get his diploma) but he's completely shut down in himself and he won't talk to me. I also grew up in a very bad city and environment (a lot of bullying/violence). Growing up I basically had no friends and I was really depressed and suicidal but I always reached out to women and guys for friendship and I had a few friends. I also worked on myself a lot by going to the gym, learning english to get out of my city and watched a lot of movies/tv shows. The biggest pain of my life is loneliness, I never had any actual love from a woman except an online relationship and I always felt the need of having and receiving love since a very young age(pre-school). I tried so much to meet women so much but they never liked me despite I'm not ugly( just short) and I'm very nice to be with. 2 years ago I left my country in a very bad depressive state and I moved in another one completely alone, I did it to improve my life and meet someone new. Nevertheless it did not work out, I texted to a lot of girls but no results, enrolled in a uni(no results), gym(no results), events (no results). I know it is very important to be alone but guys... I'm alone since I fucking born. This condition makes me really depressed, it kills me. I'm completely burned out and almost incapable of working and functioning like a normal human being and I need to do a lot here to live and think about my future in terms of money and career. What should I do? I can go to therapy, I can take meds and I did all of that but how do you fill this hole?

Also, I've been having issues with my sleep, I can't stop thinking when I'm trying to sleep, all the thoughts rush into my head and I stay awake until I'm too tired to think.
The lack of desire to do anything has affected literally everything, I no longer enjoy doing things that I used to love, I procrastinate on things that I would've done otherwise as a way to unwind.

Advice addressing s/o mental state?,1,0.99,1717186986.0,"Hi I never posted on reddit before, but I wanted to seek advice regarding my s/o’s current mental state.

Today he began explaining to me how he has a tendency to have his thoughts spiral at times if he isn’t always occupied with something. It has been something that has been happening since October allegedly. He brought this up again to me since he began overthinking last night and I have recently began pointing out the fact he is smoking nicotine more often. I think this is related to adhd, as he said, and he seems to be well aware of his habits and issues. But, at the same time, already is content with life, and doesn’t regret anything and wants to remain positive, that he already knows how to cope by constantly distracting himself.

 I feel like if he is still spiraling, and needing to constantly keep himself occupied to AVOID spiraling to the point he’ll start itching himself etc, that there is still something that needs to be addressed? Especially if it involves unhealthy habits. He says he isn’t addicted and could easily stop, but I couldn’t be sure since it’s recent. 

His last two relationships resulted him in getting belittled and his feelings and such dismissed on top of being yelled at or getting into arguments over the smallest of things, both had ended in him being cheated on and further more he has been to therapy once or twice which he felt didn’t help besides being told he needed to spend more money on himself. I believe these are major factors in his mental state, since he had also mentioned he wasn’t used to explaining to someone who cared about him, how he feels.

 Though at the end of the conversation I pointed the above and such out and mentioned how there is still better ways to go about things but he almost seemed in denial since he simply repeated saying he just needs to be doing something in the moment.

I felt the need to seek advice on what this could be signs of or how to go about this further? Since he seems so confident in his “solution”. I want to support him and such the best way possible.

is life just an inconvenience?,1,1.0,1717186414.0,"(tw: please only read further if you don't mind strangers complaining about their mental health)

for me? it is. definitely. and I'm interested to know what is wrong with me and how many people actually struggle from the same thing. let me explain.

I'm only 18 y.o. and I'm tired. and it feels like I've always been tired, ever since my very early childhood.

yes, I'm 100% depressed. but listen. it's not the main point.

I don't know how to put it right. but.

I often hear people saying something like ""you don't want to die, you just don't want to live your current life anymore"", meaning something along thelines of ""not live itself is bad, it's YOUR life that's bad"".

the thing is. no matter how hard I try to comprehend it, this rule just doesn't apply to me.

my life is pretty normal. my dad is an asshole, but he supports me nonetheless. my mom is a very loving parent. she raised me well, she loves and supposts me with her whole heart. my puppy is my best friend, apart of my human friends. I have the money and if I try hard enough to study, I have a good chance of having a ""bright"" future.

still. even though I'm genuinely grateful for what I have, even though I've been through enough shit in my life to be able to really treasure the moments of peace and the beaty of life around me, I've never even once felt ""good"" in my life.

sounds like I'm hyperbolizing. maybe I am.

it's just how I feel every day though. tired, always thinking too much. my body feels like shit, my mind is always busy processing a tausend thoughts per second — how I walk, how I breathe, where I look, how tight my skin covers my bones, how much discomfort I feel. I never know what to say, communication overall feels like an alien thing for me. I don't like it, don't understand it, yet I crave connection, crave love. only for it to inevitably disappoint me.

I pretend like I know how to feel something apart from disappointment and discomfort.

I try to stay optimistic. I play games I like, I speak to people I like, I listen to music I like and so on and so forth. only not to enjoy anything of it, no matter how hard I want to do it. 

people are a whole another story. for example I hate being touched. I don't understand the purpose of hugs, I can stand them, but it is so alien for me as well. maybe because I only ever feel touches physically and can't process them mentally — can't apply my feelings to the person I'm touching to them.

for example I genuinely love my mom, but I don't like hugging her. I don't like her hugging me. and it was the same with my ex. 

it's a whole thing and it's strange.

and I'm so sick of it. I can't take how the whole existence is a chore for me, how most of the pleasures in life just don't seem available to me, how I don't ever find anything interesting or exciting, how I can't enjoy anything. how any interaction with the world is just an inconvenience to me, how my whole existence is no more but just an inconvenience.

and if something is inconvenient, people usually don't want it and get rid of it, right?..

I guess you get what I mean.

and... I wonder how many people feel that way (I actually think that there are many like me and I've just never met anyone like that before).

I felt so ashamed of my thoughts and feelings my whole life that I was never able to share them, so if you have the same experience then please, share it.

well now i get it! i dont trust people. give and receive. if i gave people trust, theyd trust me, but i dont. and the worst thing is that i have no fuckin clue where THAT stemmed from. id call myself spoiled to the core. my parents love me n ive got everything i need (and more), and its honestly disgusting, shameful and despicable that i have ANY issues at all.

the whole trust thing can go out to my parents as well. id ask for a therapist to yet again, find out whats wrong with me without actually telling my mom why. and shed be hesitant at first cause i can say it to her BUT I CANT? her perception of me will change, shell tell everyone, my life will be ruined and she WILL absolutely get angry with me!

things then escalated when she caught me doin self harm, she got real mad and shouted saying im stupid and whatever. i asked for a therapist one more time and yeah i now talk with a woman from my country (cause mom says that all english psychologists just want to diagnose people with mental illness) bout my issues except not really cause im fucking scared of god knows what! maximum, i can talk to her bout like… creative crisis? struggle to keep a routine despite craving one? i dont know! and its a real shame cause im actually wasting money by doing this.

why the fuck am i even like this? its not like i was betrayed? been in one singular bad friendship? that yeah. i suppose its the closest thing i have to an explanation but its nothing so SOUL CRUSHING for me to freak out about little shit like this. basically all this guy did was switch from bein nice to being a dick every time and abandoned me whenever he had the opportunity. yeah thats bad but come on, i know hes a bad person now and i cut him off anyway.

There Is An Angel Who Sits Upon My Shoulder Who Goes By The Name Of Death,1,1.0,1717185821.0,"*Preface: For the last day of mental health month, I wanted to share something I wrote that deals with some rather dark struggles. Struggles that I know others face as well. Struggles that I hope might be eased for just one person who reads this, even if only in the smallest way.*

There is an angel who sits upon my shoulder who goes by the name of Death,  
And though I cannot always see him, upon my neck I can always feel his breath  
As he whispers to me relentlessly, deftly using my soul’s own Shibboleth.

He is my phantasmagorical companion from which there has thus far been no escape,  
One who has no single voice nor form yet is somehow always horrific in his shape  
When my mind’s eye sees him lying in the darkest shadows of my brain's path-illogical landscape.

For while it may be hidden, we are locked in eternal battle, one to which we both are bound,  
And though the clashes rage on deep within, the fighting furious and yet without a sound,  
The hardest part is not the fighting, it is the feeling that there will never be any respite to be found.

This war is one without casualties but still with victims–its battles waged within the mind–  
But even having entreated aid from all my demons with any values I could trade in kind,  
I have yet to even dream of any type of peace accords to which we would both agree to bind.

But what I have paid in pain to learn in this seemingly Sisyphean struggle is that one cannot sit idly by,  
That every new assault of his is but an opportunity for me to learn new tactics that I can in future then apply.  
Thus I have vowed: Whatever new mental munitions he has in store for me, nor what deadly schemes I must yet defy–  
Though I know, like you, I too will one day meet my end, it shall be he who will be the first to die.

Addicted to stress or dysfunction?,1,1.0,1717185373.0,"Hi, I have the opposite of a problem. I used to ignore everything. All adult responsibilties because of anxiety. I ignored my student loans for 10 years lol. I was paying taxes, I didn't file my W2 because it was ""Just to much to deal with"". I ignored car issues and maintenance. However, recently I have:

* Last year I paid off the student loans
* I got caught up with all my fillings and even got a nice amount of money back from several years ago!
* I got a much newer car so I don't have to worry about my car breaking down
* I have a good job, and could get another good job if I was fired
* I have saved enough money I could go 2 years without a job if I wanted.

But, I was living with all these things for years and years. They weighed on my mind daily, and when I  
started making decent money (well into my 30's) I had the confidence and less anxiety to tackle these issue head on. 

Now, I really don't know how to feel. I feel like for years I suppressed myself, I didn't do fun things because that'd be irresponsible. I lost interest in hobbies. I've been depressed. I feel like there's nothing that really gives me joy, I extinguished my interests and hobbies and relationships with friends because I was depressed and wanted to be ""responsible"". New movies and shows that I should be excited about barely register with me now. Video games have pretty much 0 interest. Now that I have gotten my life in a much better shape, I feel lost.

There is a question about my childhood I have not been able to answer and is consuming me in adulthood ,1,1.0,1717184606.0,"I am a female 21 year old woman , I didn’t had a normal childhood my grandma suffers from lots of mental health issues including extreme anxiety in which she would lock me inside the house and don’t let me go outside overall hyper protective household. because I lived  with my parents grandparents and uncle and dad back then. I don’t have lots of good memories about it and I blocked most of it but I was never physically abused  So far I’ve been able to heal everything and I had built a nice life in which I am mostly comfortable with family matters are fine now , I’ve been able to have the things I never thought were possible back then  I have a lot of independence now but there is one thing that I’ve been not able to get pass by and that haunts me. 

Since I am literally about 5 I’ve been extremely hyper sexual , I remember incredibly well so many explicit downright excessive not even  in the worse adult shots  sort of scenarios that I would daydream about around that age, my family have always had a healthy sexual outlook , they were however very careful ( as it should be ) of not playing anything explicit near me , I never witnessed anything  inappropriate ever , I would trust my grandpa with my whole life that he never has been weird quite contrary he dad and my uncle did all they could to protect me from my grandma meltdowns I would never in my life imply they did anything wrong , I was always watched by mom 24/7 , I never had male teachers or one on one interactions with female teachers either , I grew up in a very small private school owned by my family,  never I could have been molested since i was never alone not even with doctors I just can’t seem to think any scenario in which I would have been molested.
 BUT IN THE OTHER HAND 
How in the hell does a child gets those sort of urges and images ? I had no access to computers until I was 12 much less at 5 , my parents don’t like porn ( they been vocal about it now as me being an adult and they respecting my choice to watch it but saying they don’t like it themselves) I had my own room so no chance of having seen them do anything so from where ?. 
It haunts me because I randomly forget about it and then I start to be hyper sexual and remember those fantasies I had as a kid and I shock myself again like what the hell how do I got it ? It frustrates  the shit out of me , the scenarios are too specific.

 I would role play these things too as a kid one time I was caught by my mom and she questioned me if anybody had touched me etc because she was alarmed that I was role playing that my toys were eating me out meanwhile I had tired a leash to my toy and that’s the least disturbing thing I remember Role playing with toys. 
I love my family I would never think they did anything to me but I am going crazy at this 
And there is no logical explanation as to the why I would be obsessed with these scenarios. 
My uncle was never creepy either he was mainly working the whole time my dad has a lot of mistakes but I could put all my money in the fact he never never was or is weird that way , I am at a loss of what exactly cause that behavior and it weights on me very often.

besides that thoughts they're many other thoughts that really get to me like, if im a good daughter, if i did something good enough, if that one person 3 months ago still remembers me by falling up the steps. but these thoughts also ruin my ability to even go to school or to stores because i fear what people are gonna think about me and i hate the constant loud noises and bright lights and having to be social. but my most biggest fear is active shooting situations. i hate the idea of being at the wrong place at the wrong which is absolutely terrifying and enough for me to never go outside again. along with thoughts like this my depression has been terrible throughout the years and only seems to get worse. these thoughts and constant state of sadness and anxiety is making me SO EXHAUSTED physically and i genuinely cant even get up or move most times i just sleep or watch kdramas all day this way of living is making it hard for my mom and i to get along at times because i hate explaining my feelings so i just tell her i feel sick which is also true most times because i am in constant pain due to my migraines that seem to never go away.

In the past few years, let's say starting at 14, he began using drugs, started with cannabis and graduated to more serious things such as LSD, MDMA/MDMA-like substances found in ecstasy pills and probably more things that I wasn't aware he was using. He experienced psychotic and violent episodes which were untreated due to family member not caring/not knowing how to deal with it and not wanting to go to authorities.
Nowadays the kid is what I would call a bit more subdued, he smokes cannabis chronically and is clearly heavily addicted, as far as I know no other drugs are involved, and is doing nothing, and I mean nothing, with his life.

My aunt and partner are more than capable of visiting me but nine out of ten times I end up going to them. That pisses me off but I tell myself that it's not a big deal and that I'm being ridiculous, whiny, and entitled. Am I? It seems like such a minor thing.

Feeling a downward spiral,1,1.0,1717180077.0,"This might be jumble so I apologized.


Husband decided that he need to wake me the same time he wakes up cuz ""it's what good for me"". He made mention that our children sleep schedule is out of sync. Well the last couple of days, he helped me get back on track. Cool, that was all. I was going to get myself back on schedule.

The last couple of weeks has been stressful as I've been job hunting. Husband keep telling me we are in the red so I've been calling potential employers 2 times a week, trying to get answers as professionally as I can. I've also been worried about my eldest (4y/o) and his speech/ communication and trying to work with him to start talking but it slow progress.

My mother inlaw is living with us. I've been trying to give her space to adjust as she want to help care for the children while I get to work. I'm having a hard time trying to be patient with her because she doesn't communicate well and ask me for every little thing like she just visiting. I keep telling her it her house too, she can get whatever she need. But she still keep asking.

I know it stupid to get upset about my husband insisting on waking me up the same time, but I feel like it one of those moment where he think he fixed one thing so he has to fixed everything else regardless how others feel about it. I feel like he's controlling, cuz he KNOWS sleep is difficult for me as I sometime wake up in the middle of the night and it hard to get back to sleep.

It hard enough that I already got these stress mention above and feeling like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Then for him  to swoop in and start controlling how much sleep I get made me lost it.

Alienation in personal life,1,1.0,1717179357.0,"Hello, I’m not sure where I’m going with this, but sometimes I feel like I add no value in my personal (family) life. I guess this is more a thought experiment than anything else. 

I do add value in my work, I do things for myself (some meditation and working out a lot), but I’m wondering if I really add any value in my personal life. And if yes, how do I know?

I feel my way of raising my kid is underrated, I think my wife takes me for being over-protective. I have the best intentions and would trade any harm to my kid without hesitation. I try to defuse any social situation that turns aggressive/loud/negative but also feel that people just think I’m meddling. 

In my experience, most people i deal with are very bad at organizing, but not sure if my attempts to streamline and find a solution are valued. 

So I guess my question is: how do I know if I am valued. I don’t recall any recent experiences where people were happy with my input, actions or ideas. Is it little things that I overlook?is it my day to day? Is it enough that people are not trying to evade me?

My anxiety is so much better and now I'm being annoyed by others' anxiety.,1,0.67,1717178459.0,"I didn't realize I had anxiety until I started taking blood pressure medication that also treats anxiety and *poor* I wasn't always worried about things.

I now realized I also deeply fed off of people around me when they have anxiety. I now can see that and feel that my anxiety for these situations has been replaced with major irritation now.

As someone eho didn't even know they had anxiety, I definitely have major empathy for them but I am now struggling with avoiding these situations for a whole other reason; I just get really pissed off.

More specifically,ere are two people that trigger me the most the most. One is my partner's mother who I realized after a recent trip was the cause of most of my anxiety that deals with his family. It was her daughter's wedding and the day before and the day of the wedding. She had major anxiety about where she was going to sit during the ceremony and she was worried that someone was going to push her all the way to the edge of the row. And then the day after the wedding she wouldn't stop talking about. Would she be able to hang up the family photo from the wedding in her house. 

The other person was on medication to help her anxiety and now she's off and I can definitely tell the difference. Her anxiety is calmed by people responding quickly to her text messages and everyone agreeing on a plan instead of taking charge.

I am a bad person. Why?,1,1.0,1717177895.0,"I'm not sure where to start. 😭 
I think that I am an objectively bad person. I don't really care about most people, and I have homicidal thoughts more than the average person. I'm not saying homicidal thoughts = bad person, I know intrusive thoughts exist, but this is not that. I like the thought of that more than I really want to admit, and I don't think about it out of hatred/anger, just because I think the whole process would be fun. Yeah I know, pretty bad. I would never though, not for the *best* reasons, but because of the law and because I wouldn't want the people I care about to be disappointed in me. Also I think I generally see myself as above everyone (excluding those I care for) and I'm manipulative, although I try not to be. I don't want to hide the fact that I do like the idea of manipulation though. Just putting the facts out on the table.

I think I was raised really well. I love my family a lot, they mean the world to me. I would literally die for them, which almost feels out of character for me. Same with close friends, I value them so much because they make me happy I guess? I'm not sure. Also, I do have a moral compass of sorts, I know when things are bad and I have opinions on stuff like the Israel Palestine conflict. I can tell that's bad, and I think it's not fair that that's happening. I am very aware that my thoughts are bad, I don't try to rationalise it. Because of this, I'm certain I'm not a psychopath (at least from my understanding of a psychopath.) 

But in that case, why am I the way I am? I don't have any sort of childhood issues or anything, so the only option in my mind is that I have some sort of personality disorder? But a personality disorder where you want to kill people but also really care about other people isn't something I've heard of. Am I a bad person by nature, but act normal because of nurture? 

Only notable mental health stuff is I get panic attacks sometimes if I feel like I'm letting my family down? But that doesn't seem related. I try to be a good person no matter what is going on in my head. I think it's not too hard to do that, and overall being good will make my life better. That doesn't change my thoughts though, and the fact that if I knew no one would ever find out, I would commit any crime in a heartbeat (besides SA, because that's seriously fucked up). I don't want to sugarcoat it, I'm a bad person, but why am I like this?

I don’t know if it’s like because I have trauma from basic or something. It’s not only the academy whenever I try something new I panic about it especially when I leave home.

My therapist doesn't understand me,1,1.0,1717176107.0,"rant about lots of stuff:  
  
first of let's start about myself. I'm Lior, 18, AMAB, not sure if I'm guy or not, diagnosed with autism in the age of 3 or 4 (was also diagnosed with hypotonia at that time), started taking ADHD meds when I was 9 (not sure when was my ADHD diagnosis), and was diagnosed with OCD in the age of 16.  
  
anyways, I have a few struggles:  
  
social struggle - because of being autistic person, and very obviously so, I heavily struggled making friends. I don't have friends rn. I don't have social skills. If anyone can practice me it would help because I'm very awkward  
  
gender identity crisis - I only started thinking that I was trans only after I've been in trans groups online. Up until then I didn't even think of that. I want to be feminine but I'm too depressed rn to actually care about looks. Thing is I'm way too ok being seen as guy so maybe i'm not trans. If anyone has tips about it I would appreciate it  
  
sexual and therapist struggle - I'm addicted to porn. I have weird kinks and fetishes that I think stem from trauma like AB/DL, DD/LG, CG/L, little space, ageplay etc... and I'm ashamed about them. Thing is, those two things are unrelated to eachother as I was into ABDL even before I was addicted to porn. Now I feel so bad because there's negative nsfw effects that I don't know can mention here that are affecting me, my sexual well being and my mental health because of porn.  
  
now I thought that my therapist was good person to talk to this about. Boy I was wrong. Instead, when I told her about being into AB/DL, she told me ""are you into child þorn?"". Yes, not even my therapist understands me  
  
Now I'm 18, and I wanted to go to munches (munches is like kink/fetish meeting where you don't do sex but you do talk about it), now I tried talking her about it and she's seems very sex negative, and that she doesn't want me to go to anything sexual but I mean I'm 18 so? and like she barely knows about anything is sex that isn't vanilla and it's so frustrating because I get from her tips that are only helpful for vanilla people  
  
Worst of all, she denies like what I am. She tells me I don't know what I'm into. ofc I know what I'm into, not my fault she has all sorts of assumptions.  
  
and like anyone can help me here with that? like what should i do? should I avoid sexual activities or not? how to be safe in them without someone taking advantage of me? how to distinguish between reality and fantasy? I want to have sex that isn't influenced by porn (thing is, the stuff I'm into are barely ever made into porn so porn can barely affect me in that regard)  
  
4. physical abuse - I was physically abused by mom. It was mild but it was still abuse. Worst of all. she tries to tell me that it wasn't big deal. Of course it is big deal, of course I'm mad at you for that. She tries to get better, but she's still bad person  
  
5. OCD - my thoughts just never stop and it's so annoying. Like I can't deal with this anymore

i’m trying so so hard to be there for him, to comfort and support him the very best i can. i always reassure him that he’s not alone and i’m right there by his side through everything. he asks me for advice so i always give him it. i’ve tried getting him to see a psychologist (bc he’s been telling me that he desperately wants to stop feeling this way and that he wants help) so many times but he just always puts it off or when he does book an appointment to get a referral, he just never goes.

it’s impacting so many aspects of his life and they’re on the verge of falling apart— he’s on the verge of falling apart again. i’ve spoken to his best friends and while they do support him and give advice like i have, they’re drained. i don’t want him losing his friends because i know it’s going to end up impacting other things even more badly.

"The feeling of ""Brain Changing"" or ""Feeling and Thinking Different"" Suddenly or Overnight?",1,1.0,1717172235.0,"Hello, I was talking to two friends who have mental health issues (bipolar and schizoaffective) about something I experience and assumed they'd be able to relate to the feeling of, like, your brain changing very suddenly. However, they didn't, and I'm a little curious as to what's going on in my brain or if anyone at all can relate to this experience (which I will describe in more detail below). I talked to my psychologist about it, but for now, I'm just journaling about when it happens (and it's pretty sparse so I really haven't journaled but one entry in a few weeks where I feel suddenly very depressive and hopeless about things). To describe/explain it to see if anybody else relates or knows what is happening:  


Every so often I get just a feeling of my brain and cognition of things being entirely different. Like, sometimes I just very suddenly feel happy and open to things, the things I remember have a different light air to them, the colors look brighter, I become very optimistic, etc. There are also times where that's the opposite, where suddenly everything is darker and hopeless and confusing and it's hard to even think because it's so hopeless or feels like my brain is caught in loops/cycles. It's just a very sudden click where everything is different feeling and the way my brain works feels entirely different. I gave two extreme mood-related examples, but it could also just be I feel differently or have different opinions on things. It's hard to describe but if you've experienced it I feel like you'd know what I'm talking about, an ""Oh of course, when you think differently"". A friend of mine who's studying counseling right now asked if I meant like ""connecting the dots and finding new thought patterns when getting a new perspective"" but it's definitely not that. I've changed the way I've thought about things, learned new things, etc. while in one of these moods particularly without having this mental ""change"" where I FEEL and PROCESS entirely differently.   


It's possible I maybe just don't understand how to verbalize something really normal? I really assumed that we all just kinda feel this experience, but apparently not. I've been diagnosed with developmental trauma, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, moderate major depressive disorder, and (I believe because it was mentioned to me when I described something to my psychologist, but I don't know if that was something he was just saying or saying I had) persistent depressive disorder.

I've never been able to focus in school and now I feel awful :(,1,1.0,1717170606.0,"This is going to be kind of rambly but I'd really love some advice. Lately I've been feeling worse and worse about myself  :""] I won't go into everything I'm insecure about because I could go on for hours tbh. The main thing is really my terrible education. 

I've never in my life been able to focus in class, ever. I've picked up some stuff but overall I pretty much didn't learn anything from 12 years of school. It's kind of weird how no one seemed to care that much? I mean the adults would constantly complain about me being distracted and irresponsible, but I've never known why I was that way or how I could possibly fix it. 

At some point (fairy early on I'd say) I pretty much completely gave up on even trying to study or do homework. It just felt like a massive waste of time considering I would never retain anything. Studying has always been completely miserable for me, I've tried so hard to keep my focus on a lesson, but it's never worked. I'd either get distracted or get insanely sleepy to the point I could barely keep my eyes open. I feel so awful and guilty. I don't understand why I've never been able to study. I've never been a good student. I was always pretty forgetful and I really felt like it took me longer to grasp most concepts. 

Every time we would learn about something new, the teachers would start asking questions and there would always be at least one kid who would answer immediately before I'd even processed the question. And so school went on this way, I was so behind on everything that eventually I just gave up. I have no idea how I even passed. It would always take me so painfully long to grasp new concepts that I really struggled to convince myself it was worth it. I've also always had a really hard time keeping track of many things at one, so the sheer amount of different subjects and projects and deadlines was just so overwhelming. It was so hard and the only response I ever got was being called lazy and irresponsible. Maybe I was and still am, but I don't want to be. I just really don't know how to fix it and to be 100% honest I still kind of struggle to care. Even tho I feel so awful just the thought of trying to study for any amount of time makes me want to fall asleep. I don't know why, I just feel so sleepy constantly :/ this wasn't an issue when I was a kid but it has been for the last 2 years or so. 

For a while now I've almost been feeling like I don't even have control over my own actions, I've tried to follow study advice, it never worked. Studying always made me so painfully frustrated like I was chained down in place or something if that makes sense? 

I think I've made this long enough so I'll just mention one last thing, I have questioned if I may have ADHD in the past, but I really don't have enough symptoms  I don't think. I don't experience hyper focus or hyper fixations and in general my only real problem is focusing on studying and drawing (I'm an artist and have always been a huge procrastinator with my art to the point I never finish anything lol) 

That's all I can think of at the moment, there's probably a lot more stuff worth mentioning but this is the general gist.

**Title: Seeking Help for Mental Health Issues: Fluctuating Serotonin Levels?**,1,1.0,1717168241.0,"

Hi everyone,

I'm struggling with what I believe might be fluctuating serotonin levels and I'm hoping to get some advice or insight. For the past few months, I've been experiencing extreme highs and lows in my mood and physical well-being. 

Sometimes, life feels really good and I feel great, but just a few hours later, I experience intense mental and physical pain. My legs often hurt, and sometimes I feel pain throughout my whole body. This cycle used to occur over days – I would have really good days followed by bad ones. But now it seems to change within hours, and it feels like my body and mind are constantly trying to balance out.

I'm not sure what's happening, and it's becoming really hard to cope. Has anyone experienced something similar or have any advice on what this could be and how to manage it?

Thank you for your help.

If by chance i forget to do something, watch phone for even 5-10 mins after studying for 3-4 hrs straight, or refuse to do something she says, she shouts at me, berates me and says very hurtfull things like she should've never birthed me, im a burden to this world, im a mistake and many more things. I have had many panic attacks because of this. I am also never happy in the house and im happy when im w/others other than my family members. I cant talk to her about anything related to my life other than my achievements. If I say something to her, she becomes emotional and she goes like, ""If she's like this when she's this young, how will she treat us when she's older?"" After all this she says that im the one mentally torturing her! Do you think what she said is true? whatever happens within us, she exaggerates it and tells it to dad and dad scolds me because of her. For instance, today mom got angry at me because i told her i wouldn't cut the cucumbers as salad because they were rotten. she then threw a whole wok full of food away because I told her that she's not the only one who's mental health is suffering because of this and she knows that I hate wasting food more than anything. Then because of all this my appetite was ruined and I did not eat lunch whereas she had eaten, she called me in the room she was sitting in and asked me to eat the food. And she just returned back to normal like nothing happened and she did not just cause me so much mental distress. I teach classes and I take sessions at my school about how important mental health is when my own mental health is shit. So ironic. Im so tired of this and I wanna just run away from the house and I can't wait for the day I complete school and go to a foreign country for studying. She also body shames me a lot and then when I feel hurt, she says, ""It was just a joke silly!"". Am I overreacting or are my parents actually toxic?

At this point I feel like I don't have any escape from this until I grow up. Also, I have to always bottle up my feelings and I cant talk to anyone about this. My relatives hate my family, my dad and mom aren't an option and I cant talk to my school counsellor or my teachers because in their eye, im a perfect star child who doesn't have any issues. I don't want to ruin that image of mine as I have to stay in this school for a few more years. I don't wanna ruin all my opportunities because of them. AITAH?

Really struggling in life atm,1,1.0,1717154892.0,"Hey reddit. Please be kind to me idk what I even really want from this, maybe just some advice or encouragement from people who have been in similar situations.

I (28f) have been struggling with depression since I was a teenager, I’m also pretty sure I have ADHD but have never been officially diagnosed. Over the years I have tried therapy and antidepressants multiple times and it helps for short periods but nothing long term. The only thing that I have found helps me manage daily life is smoking weed, but it’s reached a point where I have been addicted for a number of years. I spend a lot of my income on it, I’ve even gone into debt but I can’t stop. I generally have never been good with money and built up some credit card debt for stupid things that I have no realistic way of paying off and it’s constantly on my mind. I’ve been trying for over a year to look for other ways to make money or a higher paying job but nothing is working out.

I have a sales job which I am grateful for (I know the job market is bad and I am lucky to be able to wfh 3 days a week) but I hate the job itself. I have now been there almost 5 years and I am finding it harder and harder to actually focus and do my work because I just don’t care. I feel like at some point they will realise I’m barely doing anything and fire me and then I will be genuinely fucked. I have been avoiding going to the office as much as possible the past few months because I genuinely break down in tears at the thought of having to be around colleagues. I don’t know why my colleagues are generally very nice but I just cannot hack it at the moment.

My ex boyfriend of almost 10 years left me in December and quickly got together with his colleague from work who he said was just a close friend and “like a sister” to him. I genuinely trusted and believed him at the time but it’s now pretty clear that I was naive. I genuinely feel so stupid for thinking he wouldn’t do that to me and I don’t know how I’ll ever move past it. It’s pathetic, but I think being with him was the only aspect of my life I felt genuinely happy and secure in. My career, finances etc were fucked but at least I had found ‘my person’ and felt loved and supported no matter what. Now that he has left me I feel like everything is crashing down, I have nothing that I feel safe, secure or confident in and I feel so completely alone even though I know I have friends and family that love me.

I’m struggling to do basic things like shower, eat and keep my place clean. I feel exhausted all the time. I cry almost every day, sometimes multiple times. I truly feel like no matter what I do or how hard I try nothing ever works out for me, in fact half the time it makes things worse. I know this is very likely just depression talking but it’s how I feel. I don’t know how much longer I can go on being disappointed over and over when I am trying so hard. 

Does anyone have advice for me other than just “talk to friends and family” or “take up hobbies/exercise”? I am doing both of these and I feel like talking to people makes me feel worse most of the time and hobbies/exercise are fine in the moment but as soon as I stop the horrible feelings come back.

How to battle screen addiction in a long-distance relationship?,1,1.0,1717151305.0,"Hey everybody! I'm here because I wanna seek help from people who are possibly more experienced with this than I am. I have struggled with a phone and media addiction for years.

I have always been able to wiggle my way through life despite many mental health problems and my screen addiction, but recently it has become worse. I have noticed myself sticking to my screen whenever I'm not at work. I have ADHD so I paradoxically use it to stay regulated when I feel overstimulated. Even though it stimulates me even more, it gives me dopamine. But I have trouble sitting with my emotions - my fear, my stress, my grief - and the phone is my quickest fix. And I almost mindlessly reach for it when I need it and get lost in it for hours.

I am a very curious, excitable person and happy in other areas of my life after hears of healing other traumas, but lately I have lost most of my many hobbies to this addiction thing, I cannot stick through a single book or I neglect excercising because watching Netflix, Instagram reels, Youtube or random documentaries takes up too much of my time. My home is a mess and I find myself getting more lonely and neglecting not only friends and family but also important deadlines, like for college applications for example. I've tried to get away from it many times before but somehow my addiction has always found a way to cheat - like I've used an app to block Instagram? Nice, but the browser version on my laptop still works.

I don't want to go further down this path. I've been suffering for so long, I feel like I'm wasting my life like this and I wanna finally put a stop to it. At this point, my media usage is an almost physical barrier between me and the things that I actually want. Unfortunately, because of various reasons, psychological counceling is not an option, so I wanna heal this addiction myself. How can I do that? Which tricks or tools can I use? How can I find support in friends or family etc?

The problem right now, however, is that I have a long-distance boyfriend who I love very much and I really want to be with him. I don't want to go cold turkey and get rid of my phone because I want to stay in contact with him. (Life without a phone seems unreasonable and impossible in this day and age anyway.) Exchanging memes and insights on Instagram or watching Netflix together or texting on WhatsApp frequently is what keeps us alive and connected as a couple. However, the temptation of scrolling through Instagram or clicking on a random Youtube after I've messaged my boo is sooo high, since I'm on the phone anyway.

Seeking Advice on Hypnosis for Long-Term Sadness,1,1.0,1717147910.0,"Hey everyone, I need advice on hypnosis. I've been suffering from intense feelings of sadness for over 10 years, which have worsened over time. I'm 23 years old and specifically looking for tips from people with experience in hypnosis or similar practices.

Here are my main issues:

1. **Unable to evoke feelings**: During hypnosis, I can't evoke emotions through memories. My therapist and I are trying to use affect bridges, but it doesn't work. For example, I can remember the pain of my girlfriend breaking up with me, but I don't feel anything during the session. Generally, feelings of sadness related to my ex-girlfriend can randomly come up, but when I try to focus on them, nothing happens.
2. **Difficulty getting into trance**: I often can't get into a trance state because I'm not open to these suggestions. It feels like someone could read a motor oil leaflet to me in a calm voice and it would have the same effect. My therapist always reads from a book, which feels inflexible and impersonal to me. I'm looking for ways to get deeper into the alpha or theta state.
3. **Lack of childhood memories**: I have very few memories of my childhood, which makes accessing repressed feelings difficult. While the memories themselves are not crucial, they could be a gateway to the emotions I need to experience and integrate.

Additionally, I suffer from immense shame. I'm embarrassed to cry in front of others and can't let myself go in front of my therapist.

Do you have any tips or personal experiences on how to overcome these issues? I'm particularly interested in how you've managed to evoke emotions and get into a trance during hypnosis.

Had some stress with my work being unsure how long till the business folds, my grandad being in hospital for 5+ months, watching him deteriorate and then pass away a couple of weeks ago…

i imagine things a lot spending a lot of time daydreaming and imagining diffrent scenarios, i talk to myself a lot and i make scenarios of myself arguing with other and winning.

I’m not suicidal, I’m far too much of a coward to ever come close to going through with that (or even self harm), but sometimes I do think about it.

I’m really stuck on it. I keep thinking about how I’ve changed majors twice and suddenly I’m not so sure what I’m doing is what I want to be doing, then I think about everything else and I realize I don’t want to do anything else.

I think a lot about how I’m a horrible person. I can’t commit to anything, I make excuses, I treat the people around me like garbage, and I don’t know why. I get defensive about the smallest things.

Worried about my sister and what’s going to happen.,1,1.0,1717142855.0,"I am really worried about my sister (12f). She started acting out last year and became increasingly violent and aggressive toward everyone in the house. Usually she isn’t super hands on but lately she is kicking, scratching and pulling hair, as well as recently punched my face and shoved me. 

The night she punched me, about a week ago, I ended up calling paramedics because she was overdosing on medication she took from my room. She had displayed actions consisting with self harm and wanting to take her life (walking in front of a car in the street and trying to take a pencil sharpeners blade.) and I was extremely worried. She’s also very up and down, manic almost. 

My mom has been visiting her at the hospital and she’s frequently saying things that make no sense and creeping my mom out and now asking and joking around about what would happen if she started swallowing glass everyday. She is supposed to come home soon and I’m mortified.

She absolutely hates me, I have no clue why. I’m an overbearing sister, protective but not mean. I’m scared she is going to come home and I won’t be able to watch her and something will happen such as her harming herself or anyone in the home. I have two younger siblings who share a room with her.
I’ve never met a kid like this and I genuinely fear for collective safety at home. The doctors put her on mood stabilizers but I know those can take a while to sort out.

I’m Just So Tired,1,1.0,1717140562.0,"Honestly I’m just tired and need to get this off my chest. The one person I feel safest talking to is going through their own major thing right now and doesn’t need my crap on top of it all. 

I’ve been on antidepressants for like thirteen or fourteen years at this point. Every few years they change what I take, or add something new. Doesn’t matter. I still have my ups and downs and I’m in therapy as well. I know it’s going to happen. But I’ve been struggling so hard for about three months now and I just can’t get out of it. I thought I had for about a month and it’s just spiraled again. I did the DNA test for what meds may work best and that was an absolute waste of time. All it said was basically I should take what I’m already on or what I’ve been on before. One of the suggested meds screwed me up bad in the past. I’m angry that I wasted my time and hope on this stupid test helping me. It helped a lot of people but I guess I have no such luck. 

I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal but honestly, I don’t really care if I don’t wake up. I have my list of reasons for staying and that’s all that is keeping from completely losing it. There’s no point in talking to the psychiatrist because all she’s gonna do is increase my doses, and I’m tired of that being the big answer. Sometimes it helps but only for so long. I don’t want to be maxed out on a thousand different medications yet again. Plus if I tell her how bad it is she may want to lock me away. Part of me just wants to stop taking the meds because how much worse could it really get? What’s the point of taking all these stupid pills if I’m still going to deal with this crap? Part of me had even thought, more than once, about just taking extra doses to prove the point that I could take all kinds of meds and look doc, it STILL doesn’t work but then they’ll put me away for a bit and I don’t want that. Even though taking too much of my meds doesn’t seem to be lethal. I took a leave of absence from work for a month earlier this year when it was bad but I’m right back in it and don’t want to take another leave for multiple reasons. 

I feel like I’m just stuck in this hole that I can’t get out of. I don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like such a waste of time to even try anymore when I’m just gonna end up here again. I don’t have the energy to keep trying. I have things that are happening later this year that I’m looking forward to but even that isn’t helping right now. I try to think of those things but even then it doesn’t change that I’m dealing with this. I’ve been inpatient a few times and while it helps a bit I always end up back here in this absolute darkness. There’s no avoiding it. I get a bit off the wagon at least once a year but it hasn’t been this bad in a while. I use my coping skills. I keep myself busy and my mind occupied. And then we get to two in the morning and I’m wide awake and can’t stop the torment. Eventually it has to stop but when? I pray and pray and I know God hears me and will get me through it but it’s still hard.

And in the past year she has ‘borrowed’ almost five thousand from me. All my savings gone. She doesn’t even tell me when she’s going to anymore, she just takes out. She says she’ll pay it back eventually. I know for a fact she never will. I feel so sick. Everything I had is gone and I can’t complain. I know it’s my mother and I could consider it rent/groceries… but I know plenty of people whose parents never charged them for living with them.

I just am losing my patience and my hope. I can barely look at her. I think she can tell. She keeps talking about renovations she wants to do this summer too and it makes me sick knowing I’ll be paying for them. I can’t do anything without seeming selfish and ruining the relationship. She’s too proud to accept help from her boyfriend but took it from me instead.

I also realize that.. graduating college isn’t a big deal to some people. And neither of my parents have ever been particularly proud of my. But I thought graduating summa cum laude might be something. But they never asked. My mom only said she was happy to have finally finished her degree before one of her kids.

In 6 months I'll have been having suicidal thoughts for 10 years,1,1.0,1717136247.0,"In about 6 months I (21F) will have been dealing on and off (mostly on) with suicidal thoughts for 10 years.

There's been so many times where I thought to myself, surely this will be over by then. But year after year I'm still struggling. I hate my life, I don't do anything and I feel like I don't know how to anymore. I've tried so so many different anti-depressants, therapy, TMS treatments, and years later I feel like I have nothing to show for it. I've wasted so many years of my life being miserable that I'll never get back and I don't know how many more I'll waste.

Despite the whole depression and wanting to die thing, I'm a naturally very optimistic and idealistic person. Deep down I always felt like things would eventually work out. 

But this is the first time where I just don't have that optimism anymore. I've promised the people in my life that I won't be dying by my own hands. I love those people and they somehow love me. So I really plan to keep that promise. But now it feels like I've been doomed to live a nightmare for the rest of my life. I'm so tired of it. I hate it and it feels like there's nothing I can do except try and fail at the same things over and over again.

It was like 30 minute ago when I realized it had been almost 10 years. I also realized that if I would have known it would've taken so long, I would've offed myself when I was still a child.

idk why I'm writing this out. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has had to deal with this for like 10 years or had to deal with depression from a young age. or just some general support.

I don’t remember. I’m just ready to become a hulk at any given second. I’m loosing friendships, love interests. I’m manipulative and toxic in many ways.

At the same time, I used to be a top performer at school, made money online (quite decent, then lost it and got screwed up by a business partner, so the last year I have been just trying to keep my head above the water) and worked out.

My Therapist Broke Up With Me,1,1.0,1717128415.0,"I’ve been in therapy consistently for the last 4 years. I first started when I couldn’t handle my anxiety and have since entered into a sort of “maintenance phase.” 

In January I ended a professional role and had a lot of regret, guilt and big emotions surrounding my decision. My previous (now ex) therapist, was with me as I dealt with that. They were also with me when I got my new role and finally felt like things were coming together. However, once I started my new role I had a lot of adjustments, changes and unexpected shifts happen that caused even more regret and big emotions. My previous therapist was with me during this time as well (end of Jan-beginning of Feb). 

Since then it’s been hard to schedule appointments because my work has just been kicking off and I’ve been trying to find a new routine. I’m happy to say that since my last session (end of Jan-beginning of Feb), I’ve found my place at work and feel proud of myself for the hard decisions I made to get here.

That all said, I had one therapy session booked after the session at the end of Jan-beginning of Feb and ended up having to cancel it due to a work commitment. However, prior to this I likely only cancelled once before and that’s after a year or so of seeing this therapist. I also cancelled well over 48 hours in advance both times.

After that cancellation, it was hard to find time to book an appointment. Cut to this week (end of May), I finally feel settled and able to make an appointment. I sent in requests for now through August (all done via an app) and check back a couple days later and they’ve disappeared. I figured it was an error. So, I went back on after talking with a friend about it and my want to get back into therapy and see an open appointment for this week. I excitedly book it, but within a half hour or so I receive a message. It states the following: 

“HI, I think I have taken you as far as I can and at this time I recommend working with a new provider. Customer service can assist with this. I would also recommend working with (insert two large orgs near me)…outside of this app. Take care!”

Now, immediately I felt sick. I’m an anxious person and I couldn’t help but wonder why’d she say so little about the real “why” to an anxious overthinker she’s known for a decent chunk of time. To make matters worse, you can’t message your provider and customer service cannot either, so I have now way of getting “clarity.” 

So, be honest (and kind please💛), is this normal? Does it seem abrupt and rude? Is it because I had trouble scheduling of late? She knew the circumstances, so it just leaves me confused.

And I feel alone because people cannot see how or why I haven't walked away from him. Especially when they see what it does to me. 

Does anyone understand what I mean when I feel such sadness over the fact that I make SO MANY valid points with him and it's just a waste of thought and energy.

I had a therapy appointment, and it went well, but afterwards things just started to go downhill. I don’t understand why, but I suddenly starting thinking about all things that bother me. Normally I’m able to handle these sorts of things, but I couldn’t this time. I tried to distract myself by doing small things, but it wasn’t enough. This is where things get really disgusting and shameful. I tried to make myself feel better by masturbating. I don’t know why I thought that would work, logically I know I hate it and it always makes me feel worse. I wasn’t even feeling genuinely aroused since my antidepressants have killed my sex drive. I did it anyway, because it often feels compulsive. It’s like an addiction. I felt disgusting after, like some kind of perverted freak. My groin and legs actually hurt physically afterwards, maybe because my body wasn’t aroused enough. The negative emotions I have surrounding this are just too powerful and they won’t leave my head. I feel vile, gross, evil, and disgusting, disgusting a million times over. I don’t know how to describe this feeling in words. It’s like a unique emotion I only get after doing anything sexual.

I have things to do, but I feel so overwhelmed, I don’t know if I can do them. It all feels like too much. All of this is making me feel terrible because I was just talking with my psychiatrist about weaning off my meds.

My boyfriend’s schizophrenia is getting worse. ,1,1.0,1717121873.0,"Hi I’ve never posted on reddit before but I really need help. 
My boyfriend Aaron (M22) and I (M21) have been dating for 3 years. Hes not diagnosed with anything, but this past year hes developed a lot of signs/symptoms of schizophrenia. He has visual and auditory hallucinations. And sometimes delusions. Sometimes dissociation. These last 3 weeks it’s been very bad.  
He’s hallucinating constantly. He is so fucking scared and exhausted. He seems to have like really intense hallucinations followed by dissociation. Hes just. Not himself. His eyes are tired and dull and all he really wants to do is just sleep. It’s breaking my fucking heart and I need to take him to the hospital. 
That’s where the issues come in. 

Aaron’s mom died in a hospital because of a mix up with two medications. They reacted badly together and she passed. Aaron was 15. The whole time I’ve known him he hasn’t seemed to have an issue with doctors/hospitals (for any reason other than money.) But this has seemed to resurface back into a delusion (at least I assume that’s what it is). I’ve brought up how he needs to go get help and he completely freaked out. He told me he’s too scared to go and that they’ll kill him if he’s there. I tried to reassure him that it wasn’t true and so many people go to the hospital and get taken care of. He is wholeheartedly convinced that he will die if he goes. 

Shit continues to get worse after that. Hes either in a state of panic or dissociation. Hes hallucinating shit constantly. I’m tired. He’s tired. I tried to get him to go to the hospital yesterday. He was sobbing and begging me to stop asking and saying shit like “why do you want me to die.”
We were both crying and I tried to grab him and force him to go outside into my car. Not like. Violently or anything. Just holding/grabbing onto him tightly and trying to get him out the door. He’s bigger/stronger than me, it didn’t work. It was more just like wrestling for 10 mins and making no progress out the door. 

We’re very poor. I have health insurance. He doesn’t. The nearest hospital is about 30 mins away. I would just call an ambulance and have them tussle with him but I know fucking ambulance rides can be hundreds alone. Idk. I just need advice. I’ve never delt with something like this before. So any advice on wtf to do and how this shit works and how maybe we will be able to afford this would be great. I’m getting desperate. Hes the love of my life. He’s just sick and needs help.

I’m working a job that I fucking LOVE, and while I won’t be here forever, my prospects for the future of my career in my dream industry are brighter than almost anyone else trying to pursue the same line of work. 

But I have no control over my emotions. Even slightly unhappy things can send me into a complete tailspin. I’ve been through some rather tragic familial circumstances and came out on top, so I thought that’d make me tough enough to pull through my week-to-week inconveniences. But every negative thought I have somedays turns into instant catastrophiziation. 

I feel like I don’t have any control over my time. I can’t control what I do when my time becomes unstructured, and I end up just wasting away motionless in my apartment. 

I often find myself consumed by suicidal thoughts. Don’t worry, I WANT to live, and I’d never actually do it. But the suicidal fantasies just won’t go away, and they make me feel like a monster.

The real crux of my issue is seeking any sort of external help feels like hyperentitlement on my part. To talk to a friend would be to make them feel like they have to carry my burdens and walk on eggshells. To call 988 would be to tie up emergency resources for the sake of someone who doesn’t need them. 

I’ve tried reaching out to therapists in my area. The only clinic accepting new patients is a clinic designed specifically for women and queer clients. I’m a homosexual man, and I experience very little homophobia; like I said, my family loves me. At best, I’d be tying up resources that are meant for someone in worse circumstances than I, and at worst, I’d feel like a threat to the more marginalized people there.

Listen, I've been struggling with this issue for a few years now. I'm 15 years old and I'm struggling with my self confidence. Little warning; you'll probably not believe a lot of what this post says. I just need to vent and get some advice.

I was one of those ""smart kids"" a few years back. My entire life I've trained myself that my value depended on how proud people were of me.

My parents pride in me being their son. 
My friends pride in being close to me.
Strangers pride in having conversations with me.
My girlfriends pride in loving me.

But because I am so used to everyone being impressed with me, I've had to one up it forever all my life. It's never been an issue until recently, when it finally caught up to me.

Getting honors in school is nothing anymore. I've become friends with a few online celebrities, and now that's just an average Tuesday. I've started an online business, and at just 14 I was making half a usual adults salary! Within 6 months!

What I'm trying to say is, everything I do I do it because it makes the people in my life feel proud that they love me. But it's getting so out of control that I would need to become a millionaire by next week to keep my life in order and not be seen as a failed Einstein or something. 

I know reddit is just gonna go ""talk to your parents about this!"" or ""don't worry about what other people think !!!"" or whatever. Honestly I don't care. I would like some actual, non-generic advice for this. That is the only way you can help.

I had a lot on my mind, and I usually take a long time to fall asleep. So, I stayed in bed for a very long time, waiting to fall asleep.

Then I started hearing what sounded like several voices making noise or saying something I couldn't understand. Over time, it began to sound like a crowded room of people talking, but again, it felt like it was coming from my mind.

By this point, I was desperate, feeling like crying and confused about what was happening. I feel like I stayed like this for hours.

I became even more desperate, tried to lie down, and I only remember going back under the covers, feeling desperate, wanting to cry, and confused, in a mix of negative emotions, then trying to get up to try to make it stop and not working and trying to sleep and feeling this negative emotions again. I thought in calling or going to my brother's or mother's room, but i thought? Is this really happening, i am getting crazy? Will they call me crazy if I desparately tell all this informations to then while waking then up? So i just stayed by myself.

I woke up the next day and kept wondering: was it real? Was it a very vivid nightmare? Or did I have, I don't know, a schizophrenic episode? Or was this some kind of panic attack?

My Psych Ward Experience,2,1.0,1717099939.0,"When I first went to the psych ward, I was a teenager. I’ve been struggling with mental health ever since I started school, and by the time I was 10, I had begun self-harming. I’m still not sure why I chose that path or how I even found out about self-harm; I just know that I did it. My caretakers were aware of my self-harm but never sought help for me. 

At 15, I made my first attempt on my life, which landed me in the hospital. I stayed there for a month or two, missing a lot of school. That wasn't my last attempt that year, but my experiences in the psych ward were surprisingly pleasant at the first hospital. The girls I met there were really sweet and included me in their activities. Seeing younger kids, some as young as 12, was disheartening, but the nurses were nice, offering some comfort in an otherwise difficult time.

However, not all experiences were positive. During my third or fourth week, a girl contracted COVID, and the entire unit went on lockdown until the infected girls tested negative. Some staff members treated certain patients differently, either better or worse, depending on the individual. The counselors, though limited in number, tried their best but couldn’t see us as often as needed. It felt like there should have been more than two counselors working throughout the week.

Some patients would flaunt their trauma like trophies, often exaggerating their stories to seem worse than others. This behavior pissed me off, so I avoided them to prevent conflict. The psychiatrist was another challenge; every time I saw her, she prescribed new medications. Talking to her was hard because any mention of something wrong led to more pills, leaving me unable to stay awake during the day. Falling asleep from the medications resulted in punishment, despite the overwhelming dosages.

Eventually, I got my act together and started intensive in-home therapy, which turned my life around. I’ve been out of the hospital for a long time now, finished the intensive in-home program, and started DBT therapy. I finally saw a psychologist who provided accurate diagnoses: ADHD, autism, BPD, anxiety, and depression. I’m still on a lot of medications but am slowly tapering off them while remaining stable.

So I went to my doctor and she told me the dose I was on was actually a low dose. I’d already been feeling less anxious on the low dose (like the edge was taken off) so I talked to my psychiatrist and said I wanted to go higher and he said that would be the right move.

I really have a lot of hope for a higher dosage. I previously was on medication to treat depression, but my actual issue is severe anxiety/ocd, and the sadness/hopelessness I feel stems from my struggles with that.

I also really hope it helps me with my emotional sensitivity too. I feel like I’m very sensitive and I know medication won’t fix everything (maybe one day they’ll come up with a magic pill - I’d pay whatever they wanted!!) and at the same time I’m really hoping it will dull my hyperawareness to everything. Like the constant feeling of being on edge or too aware, and being unable to relax. 

I also know if I combine my medication with continuing my DBT & therapy (and PRACTICING MY SKILLS!!) and exercising + eating healthy I feel like that would boost the meds effects and reinforce more positive thinking and outlook.

The first thing that makes me unsure whether it is dissociation or not is that this feeling occurs within my control. It's not my brain's reaction or defense mechanism to a situation; there is nothing that triggers this feeling. If I want to feel it, I can. When I first discovered this feeling, I was tongue-tied because amidst all the ordinariness of reality, this feeling seemed unreal, and I couldn't grasp what it was. It had no name, but it had a feeling. Then one day, I stumbled upon an article on dissociative fugue on the internet, and although it wasn't exactly the same as what I felt, it existed on the same basis. Subsequently, I learned about dissociation, and in a way, the name for my feeling was now established, yet not precisely. When I experience this thing, for a brief moment, it's like reality literally disappears, and you free yourself from reality, shutting down your consciousness. You take a suffocating break from reality for 15-20 seconds. If I had to concretize the feeling, it's like drowning while this situation is happening, and when you come back, you take a deep breath. When you come back, for a moment, you feel like a conscious robot, experiencing a slight shock.

I think I have PTSD from being bullied ,1,1.0,1717100403.0,"Hello everyone, 

I was wondering if any of you could relate to this. 

I was bullied during elementary and high school. Now, as a grownup it still affects me, although I know on a cognitive level that it shouldn't. I try to be rational but I still feel fear whenever I'm in public spaces with unknown people. It's a fear of being targeted again. For example, I went to a restaurant with my mom today. It's just a normal experience but I still felt ill at ease as if there are people there who want to target me if I don't appear confident.

Basically, I always feel this fear that I must be careful not to appear as too unconfident because it could attract bullying. This is totally irrational of course but I can't shake it off. I have not only had this experience today. I have it frequently around other people. For example, I took a walk some days ago. On the way there were some guys drinking on a bench. I immediately felt uncomfortable because they could target me. When I passed by they laughed at me and it just triggered my fear that I'm an easy target... although cognitively I know this has nothing to do with me; they are just random guys looking for a fight or so.. 




The problem for me today is that I still feel hyper vigilant and tense in social situations because of my fear of being an ""easy victim"" and that I may attract bullying. Therefore, I feel scared of appearing as not so confident.. Although I'm sure I don't appear that way. It's just a deeply seated anxiety I think. It's a feeling of not feeling safe. Therefore, I'm always hyper vigilant scanning the area for potential danger. What I also hate is that I engage in automatic mind reading. My mind fills in what other people must be thinking about me, which is always negative. I know it's not true and that I shouldn't do this, because I can't know what people think. Nevertheless, I think this is some kind of survival mechanism that I developed as a bullied child to see the danger of being bullied coming...

Cognitively, I know nothing is wrong but emotionally I can't help but feel this way. 

The absolute worst is that I think I can never get over this. That is, I'm afraid bullying caused permanent psychological damage that I cannot fully undo in my lifetime. I think my amygdala, responsible for fear, is overactive as a result of being bullied. Therefore, it keeps scanning for potential dangers... 

The worst for me is that I just want to recover and move on. I don't want to be a prisoner of it my whole life. 

I was wondering if other bully victims could relate? It would be wonderful to exchange and learn from your experiences. ",mentalhealth,Useful_Necessary,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d4dfuy/i_think_i_have_ptsd_from_being_bullied/,4,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06

Mental health issues led to losing someone I loved. Working on myself and have improved a lot. What to do now?,1,1.0,1717098333.0,"Long read! We broke up almost a year ago. I can’t move on and can even think of loving someone else ever. 
My childhood was pretty chaotic and my mind had gotten used to NOT being at peace. I have seen a lot of verbal and physical violence while growing up. This led to a lot of self sabotaging instances where life kept taking all the wrong turns. On top of that I have always suffered with anxiety and depression. Due to this I was unable to trust anyone and just kept overthinking about things that can go wrong. I was ambitious though but couldn’t achieve much yet due to the above mentioned traits. For four years in my early adulthood I was tangled up with visa and immigration issues due to which I had to let go of a dream and life just took a big turn. I was heavily traumatized due to this and to add to things, I am hardly expressive so couldn’t talk to anyone to help resolve things as I myself was unaware of what’s happening to me. 
Fast forward 2021, I met this girl. Connected very well and within a few months we started falling in love with each other. She had the most genuine vibe I have ever gotten from anyone else. But as time passed my anxiety creeped in. I started finding things to fight as my mind was used to chaos. I kept self sabotaging the relationship. She was the only one to whom I had expressed my sadness on the visa issue and I cried for the first time after eight years after the incident. Things just kept getting worse and there were just a lot of fights on petty reasons. And due to this, she started reacting in a way which was extremely rude and disrespectful. Abuses and a few hits on my body too. But now I realized how she was pushed to the edge as I bothered and fought with her too much. Her anger levels went too high. 
However, during all this time we had so many lovely moments and there were strong feelings from both the ends. But we broke up and I still kept bothering her by staying in touch too much. I seeked therapy and that’s where I learned all this about myself and worked on it constructively. I again went thru visa issues and I was taken back all these years to that trauma period. I was planning to end things and thought of getting in touch with her to seek support. However I had to use another phone as I was blocked everywhere. I clarified to her that it is me from the other phone. However she thought I tricked her and all my love for all these years was a hoax. She totally became unresponsive and changed her number too. 
I have realized it was my mistake since the beginning and have worked so much on myself. I need to get her back. I have tried to date 5 women in the past year but can’t have any feelings for them as I just want the one.
Please positive advices only. I had to skip many details because of the size. Love was genuine from both the sides. I am sure of that. What should I do? I can’t get in touch with her, but can message her friend or on her 2nd instagram account.

Possible ways to restore my appetite and my will to live,1,1.0,1717097545.0,"
Hi, I hope you guys can suggest some ways to help me out of this situation. It is unfortunate that clinical help is not available in my place, so it would be nice if I can get some suggestions to relieve this mental problem.

I'm a college student and I've just finished a semester with a lot of laboratory works and assignments. It seems that I began to lose my appetite at the start of this semester due to typical stressful factors related to  work. When I work too much and in a long period of time, I won't feel hungry. However, as the amount of tasks decreased eventually, I have not yet found the initial desire to eat again. 

Everytime I consume food, I feel like trying to survive and not actually enjoying the taste of it. I used to have a healthy relationship with food, but now I'm struggling to love it again. Food used to be one of my joys in life. Now lacking of food desire makes me feel less of a human. 

I noticed that I've become physically weaker, maybe due to muscle loss. Now I can barely do my daily routine without feeling exhausted and painful.

My family and friends are also concerned about my recent appearance. My collar bone and ribs are now so visible. I feel terrible for letting them worry so much, I want to eat normally again so they can feel happy for me.

I've been working on myself for years and made some progress, however, I still have a long way to go until I'm in a healthy mindstate. The situations I had some cuddles I felt more alive and connected. It was like food for soul. I feel lonely and crave some intimacy and it's sad to think I can't have that until I'm finally good, although it might enhance my healing process.  Admittedly, I might wish to experience the love parents should provide and that is not fair for the other person, but at least I'm aware of that.

I get some matches and dates, but a lot of issues surface, especially when meeting in person. I have a hard time being authentic as I fear showing who I really am and I don't really know it either.

I (17f) have been thinking about getting help,1,1.0,1717092665.0,"I've been self harming since I was 12. When I was 14 ish I went to the counselor at my school and she told me to de-stress and gave me some general advice. It didnt really help and i was scared of my parents finding out so i didnt pursue it much. The woman was also pretty harsh and not very good at giving advice, it usually just made me more stressed. 

When i switched schools this year i decided id try again with a new counselor. This one was way nicer, but didn't really get the problem I guess? She told me to write stuff down, which I've always been doing and doesn't de stress me but it's nice. She also gave my some anxiety advice but I don't have anxiety so that didn't help. I went for a few weeks but I stopped when it didn't help and things got busy. 

Now I'm realising nothing has changed. I'm not getting better and I go through phases of wanting to die and then feeling fine and then going back. I've been pretty sure I'm some kind of neuro divergent since I was about 13. I haven't checked because of my mum and because I never felt it was worth it. Yes, i feel horrible but am i really that bad?

Well, i think it is now ig. I don't wanna go the rest of my life crying multiple times a week and having horrible mood swings. I wanna get better at dealing with my stress and being able to actually relax (not just diatracting myself til i forget whats wrong). I wanna be able to go to the beach without being scared of people seeing my scars. 

Any advice on how i can go about getting help? Do I try to seek some kind of diagnosis or do I talk about the self harm mainly? I just dont know what to do or how to get helpful help.

Teenage boy mental health,1,1.0,1717091765.0,"My little brother (17) over the last year has experienced dissociation. At first, it started at school when he would relay the his classmates were talking about him all the time which led to them discussing me and his older brother and our facebooks. Then it lead to teachers calling me to tell me that he has been talking and laughing to himself. The final straw of public school was when I received a call that he had taken drugs at school. After picking him up, he explained that he didn’t take anything and the teacher labeled him on drugs. I asked why he would be acting like he was on drugs and his response “idk they just think that”. He was then transferred to online school. 
With the online schooling, he would go to the physical school twice a week. The teacher there started calling me saying he was talking and laughing to himself and doing no work. He was then dropped from the school. 
His daily activities include going outside to stand and “talk” to “people” around him, lay in the sun for hours, then he wears all black to go on runs. The police has inquired about him twice now.
He also has changed his diet to no meats.
He also will not be in vicinity of cleaning chemicals.

Could use some advice,2,1.0,1717075573.0,"Hi all,

Really looking for some advice here as I’ve felt lost most of my life. I’m 32f, divorced with two kids (7&3). The divorce was incredibly hard and I’m just now feeling at peace with everything and our coparenting relationship. The ex has BPD and is an alcoholic so it was a very difficult relationship. He was abusive and I suffer with a lot of PTSD due to things that happened during our time together.  I was also a mother and a wife from 24 to 29 and completely lost myself when we divorced. I’ve basically worked for myself selling on eBay for the last ten years off and on and more recently started camming and OF after realizing the money it brings it. I absolutely hate the work that I do. It makes me feel like a piece of meat but the money is so good that I push through it.

I just recently decided I wanted to go back to school and started summer courses this week and it has just thrown me into a whirlwind of is this what I want. I’m going for my psych degree with the intent of becoming a therapist. I’ve worked for myself for the past ten years. Is this truly what I want? What if I put all of this time and money into school just to realize I’ll make more money selling myself on the internet? My true passion in life is traveling the world. Will this allow that? 

I’ve also realized how incredibly alone I am. I have my children who truly are my world but I find myself scrolling social media instead of being in the moment and playing with them and it kills me. I’m not going to get this time back with them and yet I’m spending their early years depressed, anxious, and confused. I’m in a new relationship as well (5 months) and am realizing he too is an alcoholic and I need to end things. I found several empty liquor bottles in his truck after smelling alcohol on his breath. He’s been drinking on the job and drives all through the city during.  We had a talk about a month ago on how his drinking makes me uncomfortable. He was drinking a 750ml bottle every other night. I witnessed him take a shot before driving to work one day and started to question things then.  He’s literally my only support system though. I have no friends and my family is incredibly toxic. I know I’ve managed to get into a relationship with another alcoholic and I need to leave but I’m so terrified of being alone and having no one. I just feel so lost and not sure where to go from here.

I need help,1,1.0,1717084336.0,"I need help

I’m currently 21 and was diagnosed bipolar almost two years ago, after years of depression that has only been getting worse. Since my diagnosis I’ve been having an extremely difficult time keeping up with my medication and therapy. I’ve been hospitalized twice within the past year. 

My first hospital stay was after a suicide attempt and my second hospital stay was because I was having persistent thoughts of suicide once again. I was prescribed risperisone during my most recent hospital stay and noticed an improvement once it kicked in, but I just randomly stopped taking it one day and I’ve had a hard time getting myself to take it everyday since then. I take it maybe a few times a week. I also never got a therapist or psychiatrist outside of the hospital because I moved states a week after I discharged, and haven’t had insurance up until recently. I’m on medicaid now but still can’t afford a therapist. 

My depression gets progressively worse every single day and within the past week my anxiety has been horrible and I constantly feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t stop pacing around and picking my skin. I’ve been having the most intense suicidal thoughts I’ve ever had and I just want everything to stop. 

Today I had a panic attack while I was on the phone with my boyfriend and I told him that I wanted to kill myself. He broke up with me and blocked me everywhere. He is the one thing in the world that makes me happy and now he’s gone and I’m devastated.

I found a place nearby where I think I can get therapy for free but I can’t go until next week. I want to die now though. I can’t wait until next week

"I'm terrified that this potential new job may be awful for my mental health and don't know what to do, as I need work.",1,1.0,1717082656.0,"For context I haven't worked in two years after breaking my pelvis and having a followup surgery last year. My savings have run out and my parents have been covering me for a good while now. I started searching in January and I haven't had a lot of luck because of this gap. But now I'm close to the final rounds for a job.

Here's the problem: I've always suffered from anxiety and depression, with the main source of it being my high-stress career. I work in advertising and it's known for intense deadlines, high-pressure work, and long hours. In 2018 I burned out hard and luckily found part-time work for a while, then was off for covid, able to work remotely, and then had the accident. So I haven't been a full-time in office worker in 6 years.

This new job is like 45 minutes to an hour away (accounting for rush hour traffic and finding parking). It's in-office Monday-Friday, no exceptions, and I'm noticing they already email me or offer up interview times well after 5 PM. I can tell already that they're overwhelmed there and very busy. The commute is likely to get worse in fall too, when a major event comes to the city and congests the area around the business insanely bad.

My parents have said I don't need to find a top corporate position or even full time, they're worried about my mental state too. However, at the same time, I feel intense pressure from them to take the job (or really any job offered regardless of how terrible it is). They both liked work and never had your typical office job or set hours so it's very hard for them to understand why I can be so stressed from my career.

I can't help but see this as the same job I walked away from in 2018 when I was just completely broken and throwing up in the shower from stress most mornings. I envision being this lifeless husk of a person who spends most of their time in a commute or in a windowless office space only to get home and sleep. 

But, I understand that I need to work and can't rely on them forever. I don't know what to do though, I'm just getting tremendous red flags and it's making my heart race. I'm also terrified of the lifestyle shock of being completely in control of my time all day to barely being in control of it at all and being trapped. And I'm not a very good sleeper so I know how exhausted I'll be all of the time which makes me even more worried I'll make mistakes and that will feed back to more stress.

Remote work wouldn't be as bad. Something part-time to phase myself back in to working wouldn't be so bad... but I can't seem to find these opportunities. What should I do here? I doubt I'll get an offer until Monday at the earliest but I do believe I'm the front runner for the job.",mentalhealth,IGNSolar7,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d46nhf/im_terrified_that_this_potential_new_job_may_be/,5,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06
How do I change and be better? ,2,1.0,1717068985.0,"Hi there,

I've been really struggling in my life and relationship. I can't seem to change and get better in my head. I'm always so quick to anger or get in a bad mood and I take it out on the people around me without even realising. Often, I won't even understand how I've done it. I even get frustrated because I think it's just normal.

My relationship is struggling hugely because of it. I get into such crap moods and take it out on him. Whether it's cause I've had a bad day or even just frustrated at a video game I always end up giving him the attitude and mood it comes with. Again I often dont even realise

He's basically been begging me to get better for us and i always say I am or I'll try or I'll see someone but I never do. I always think I try but then it's like I take a step forwards and then 10 back. We had a huge thing tonight and he's basically said he's done trying to help me as I just yell, ignore, or misunderstand the advice and pleas. I don't think i have much time together to fix myself anymore.

It's just so frustrating. I'll promise to seek help, look for a psychologist for a week, get frustrated they're so booked out and expensive and then realise everything is calm and maybe its better? So I stop and I think I'm working on myself when in hindsight I'm just getting worse. 

And it all gets worse because I feel like my mind is so muddled. Like a tangled mess and I can't put words to the thoughts, emotions and memories in my head. It makes communicating so hard cause all I say is ""I don't know"" and that's just not a fair response. But I truly don't know and it just comes across as me not being active in conversations, etc.

And listening. I swear I am trying so hard to focus and listen and I do but then whenever I talk about it after I can never recall anything. My partner gets so hurt cause whenever we have heartfelt conversations I'm there and present and listening but then a week later we have to have the same conversation because I can't remember it properly. 

I feel so shit cause I'm trying so hard but it really doesn't seem like it. I'm going to lose someone I love so much cause it just seems like I don't care and I don't love him, because if I did, I'd be making myself better with my actions and not just words.

These fights made me realize I can *feel*  anger much, much intensely compared to any other emotion, and when you add that to an already self loathing person not wanting to hurt the people around him, lead me to have a breakdown when I went for a 20km jog without any sleep, at dawn.

In the middle of it, I realized that being quiet and reserved when it comes to my emotions literally made me unable to scream. Like, *scream at the top of your lungs.* I literally couldn't, it felt like there was a barricade inside me, and it couldnt pass through. I've  been thinking about that for some time now, and I cant help but think that if I *could* scream, it would help me. I don't know what to do with that thought.

"Sharing my comment here about a story I discovered today, as well to highlight the issues I believe is often overlooked, sometime we don't see the hidden signs, and it's often dismissed.",1,1.0,1717078022.0,"Rorochan's story is truly heart-wrenching. There's so much more beneath the surface than what meets the eye. It might seem as if she was just seeking attention or trying to become an internet legend, but I believe there were deeper issues at play. From a video that covered her story, she talked about feeling ignored at home and bullied at school. Can you imagine what that must've been like for her? The internet probably felt like her only escape, her safe haven. Yet, it likely also fed into her insecurities and loneliness.

Her parents tried to step in by taking away her phone and computer at times. But it seems like it wasn't enough to address the root of her emotional struggles. Instead, it would seem as if they “took away her only safe haven” in her eyes. If only they knew how to better address it. It's really messed up to think that someone so young felt so alone that they saw no other way out. The internet can be such a double-edged sword, especially for kids like Rorochan who need more support offline too.

Rorochan's story to me is a wake-up call about the importance of mental health support, both online and off. We have to do better for each other. In cases like Rorochan's, it's important to approach with empathy and understanding, recognizing the complex interplay of factors that may have contributed to her struggles. I saw harmful comments regarding her and the situation, and others who seemed to fully understand. Behind the sensationalism and tragic events lies a young person grappling with profound loneliness, trauma, and a desperate search for validation and connection.

I didn’t watch the whole video of her follow through with the act, knowing the details was already painful for me. I did hear her shaky breathing which just proves, internally, she was crying out for genuine help. Rorochan's journey highlights the potential risks and pitfalls of excessive internet use, particularly for vulnerable individuals facing challenges in their offline lives. Instead of perpetuating harmful commentary or sensationalizing Rorochan's story, we should use this opportunity to raise awareness about the complexities of mental health, the impact of online interactions on vulnerable individuals, and the necessity for compassionate support systems.

  


I wrote the same message under the video of Rorochan on the Internet Archive, where there were comments that seemed to overlook the depth of her story, as well as those that were mocking and abusive. I wanted to share it on Reddit as well. Tired to keep it short, however i feel the need to enlighten others. Keep safe you all, and reach out if you need help or just someone to talk to, I'll do my best to respond. Wishing you strength and peace.

I keep an extensive file system to organize my thoughts/activities, and at times I find myself spending hours on deciding what name to pick for a document. For instance, I cannot decide on any name that ends with a ""t"", or any names that starts with ""G"", because they appear so ugly (capital T on the other hand does not).

When I find a good word, I research its etymology. If it turns out to be something that I dislike, I drop that word altogether (which is the reason I sometimes try to hold back, because when a word seems to be a perfect choice, I do not want to ruin it by introducing thoughts about an origin I do not like). An example of this would be the word ""control"", which is composed of the words ""against"" and ""roll"", which I do not like. Therefore I cannot use it anymore.

When I cannot find a good word, I try to encapsulate the meaning it is supposed to convey using something else (finding words in other languages, or making words up). An instance of this would be using the name ""Übung"" (the German word for exercise), instead of the name ""to-do"" for my to-do list. But the words picked with this method often lose their descriptive power, so much so that I at times forget what they were chosen for, and this is ineffective.

I usually find myself being taken in by trains of thought of this kind, and not only do I get frustrated, but I also waste a lot of time.

For context, two other pieces of information:

a. It is not something that bothers me daily, but I have a similar attitude to numbers. I like even numbers more than odd numbers, (4 and 8 being the best numbers in my opinion).  
  
b. The first time I could not get something out of my head was when I watched a horror movie at the age of 12. I found myself not being able to get the images out of my head, and at first I assumed it was normal, but it turned out that the scenes/images from that movie persisted for months. This is not the case anymore, I do not have such a problem, but I thought it would be important to add. 

I wanted to know if anybody knows the possible causes of this, and if there is any way anybody has had success in getting rid of this habit. Any advice, help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",mentalhealth,EquivalentImage5669,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d44aqr/obsessing_over_letterswords/,1,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06
Please help I am in so much lost !,1,1.0,1717075814.0,"Here’s my story : https://www.reddit.com/r/BusparOnline/s/00vGoVAmFg


Now I’m suffering from a lot of things and to be honest with not sure is it me being traumatized by it all or for real I have OCD now! 

My body is tired so tired ! 
I had no appetite at all I lost 8kg in week …and even if I’m too hungry to the point I feel pain in my stomach and back ! I can’t eat like 2 small spoons of rice will be more than enough the I will feel vomiting so painful and all day I have bitter nasty taste in my mouth! I can’t fall asleep without wired images and thoughts! And then waking up with racing heart after seeing vibes dream even though not feeling I actually slept but the most scary thing is that falling asleep is like mind setting! Sometimes I wake up thinking I give up and sometimes I’m fine and sometimes I feel the fear of it all and the moment I woke up I need to fix my thoughts and push fears away but I am actually very anxious and I would wish I never woke up! 

When I’m awake I hate the confusion that I have all day! shivering, stomach pain, nausea, confusion, anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts!! And just the fear of another ocd attack ugh 

I forced myself to eat ! Once I eat for a moment I feel little better then mix of ‘what’s go on’ and like mystery box sometimes I will be okay and other times no my thoughts will deepen ! 

I usually have Ibs ! And I keep thinking I do have so much serotonin.. it’s still in my body! And I know you all as usual will say no not possible but today I feel brave to say it because there actually others who struggling with high serotonin and food increases it !! 
And if it’s not serotonin what it is then !! Why all that happened to me !?!???! 

Oh and the stiffness of muscles! Sometimes I feel like I have worked out my legs for so long my legs feel tired to walk ! 

I feel so unlucky, I wish I go back in time and just not take any medication! 

I don’t know am I traumatized now so I’m creating my own intrusive thoughts so I be more caution! Or it’s real OCD! Unfortunately the doctor my file have been moved to is not familiar with OCD whatsoever she said it’s depression!!! I’m so alone in this! Am I imagining the ocd attacks now !!? I fear to let go of anxiety because my OCD was about harming I fear so much to go crazy or hurt someone! What if I became someone else ! I’m scared ! 

Sometimes I wonder simple normal task! How people just go out? And then my mind predicts many ideas especially in theme of harm and I freak out! I’m so scared! 

I won’t take any medication because I’m so scared so scared !

I was raised to never say what I think, to be always pleasant and ready to serve. Never angry or sad. Always with smile on my face and keep my thoughts to myself. 
I do not trust  anyone. I can't make myself trust someone I love.I always automatically think that they are same as me, masking what they truly think, feel and want. I made myself fake, two faced, unhonest liar. I do not know how to break this cycle. I want to say ""NO"". I want to say ""I don't care"" I want to say ""F*ck you, get out of my way!""  And yet words that are comig out of my mouth are ""Yes, no problem, I'll do it."" "" Oh poor darling, just rest, I will take care of it"" ""Yes, I can't imagine how hard is it for you, I am happy to help""
And if I am not carefull enough and let my mask slip for just a moment...then others could see how weak and pathetic liar I am. Useless, shiverring pile of garbage. I can't let others down, I have to be good enough for them, I have to be strong and supportive and make them happy. 
I am just so tired. I want to scream and tear of my smiling face. And yet I can't stop. Pathetic, right?

New anxiety developing and it’s frustrating,1,1.0,1717072356.0,"
Hi all. 26F I had gallbladder removal surgery in April. I was dealing with severe nausea for about a month before the surgery and bouts of it after as I was recovering. I’ve noticed that I’ve been developing this fear of being in the car or going to any store/restaurant since surgery. I’m like scared to develop nausea again and possibly throw up in a public place. I’m not sure why this is presenting itself now though as I’m recovering well and haven’t had any nausea for about a week and a half. I also didn’t have this problem before when I had to go to appointments when the nausea was really bad. I just feel frustrated because I don’t want this to stop my life but I literally get this choking feeling every time I’m sitting in the car as it moves. I’m trying to force myself to go on little drives with my bf to convince myself that I can do it but the feeling itself hasn’t gone away. I don’t know what to do and any help would be appreciated!

Good day to all of you, this is my first and maybe my last post. I just wanna ask about my mental state, am I sick? I couldn't afford financially and emotionally to go to a psychologist, so I would like to ask for your thoughts. 

I'm in my late teenage year, and I think I have depression and PTSD. When I was a kid, I was taken away from my parent's care because I'm very weak as a kid, and my dad's a heavy chainsmoker and alcoholic. Over the years, I tried to reconnect with my parents, and I already have one younger sibling, but everytime I fail. I was treated like I don't belong to the family, and my dad dislikes me. I felt like I was abandoned by my own family, and made me build some abandonment issues, and a little bit of anger issues. When my grandparents died, I was blamed solely for their deaths, and it took a toll on me. I carried it for years, and now I'm scared to have someone take care of me. Earlier this year, I witnessed my dad died twice ( he didn't die, he was revived twice also), since then, everytime I see people personally/online dying, I'm having difficulties in breathing, and i started throwing up. These past few weeks too, I'm having difficulties in sleeping, it's either I have insomnia, or nightmares. I'm also suffering from my sudden intrusive thoughts, and it's making me throw up.

I have a twin sister and whenever I ask her anything at all she just rushes in with all kinds of excuses. I have started to despise this and honestly I am disgusted by it as well. I have told her a couple of times about how I don't like her giving me excuses and it's fine and okay to tell me the truth or just tell it for what it is. 

Today it happened again, we were supposed to go for a trip which was planned months in advance and she decided to ditch it because her bf was coming back from another country after a year's time of ldr. I understood it, I was upset but it couldn't be helped. Today the topic came up again and I asked her if she could still come since it's only 2 days and he'll be here for a month with her under the same roof anyway apart from the 2 days. She started giving excuses how her office was organising an outing after 3 years and it's a really important event. (Note- she'll be back in time to catch a train back home but she doesn't want to) she started telling me about how she's not sure if she'll come back in time and that she can't travel so much etc etc, a barrage of excuses.

I have been getting the ick from her and idk how to proceed. She's trying to help but I have felt that she's super unhelpful with things I ask her help for. 

Finally when I asked her to stop with the  again today, she just said okay - ""next time I will just say that I don't care"" in a rude tone.

So my brother whos 12 likes to upset me. I dont mean like insult me and steal my things and i dont mean this has been happening for a few months or even just a few years. Since he was 7-8 he was violent and horrible to me and makes noises repeatedly to the point i began hallucinating the noises a couple years ago even when hes not in the house. He says slurs and racist things to upset me, follows me around making noises and blasting annoying youtube videos on loop, hits me for no reason, bangs things, breaks things and blames me, etc etc and has said multiple times detailed ways he wants to murder me and also stabbed me. He also grabs my bird from my shoulder/his cage because he knows it upsets me because it stresses out my bird. Im also anorexic and he always comments 'stop eating fat food' or something like that whenever i eat. Like i'll be in the kitchen and he'll run in from the other side of the house just to insult me. I also have severe ptsd and hate being recorded/having my photos taken and he constantly records me or even just angles his phone at me to look like hes recording me to trigger panic and ptsd attacks. 

  
All day everyday its 'shut up' 'stop making noises' 'stop doing that' 'leave me alone' and its gotten to the point i tried to take my own life because i genuinely cant stand this kid anymore.

  
He doesnt stop and keeps going until i literally scream at him and then what does this little shit do? He LAUGHS at me. Hes caused multiple full on breakdowns and LAUGHS everytime.

  
I dont know why he does this cause i was never mean to him????? EVER! And the only time he ever gets genuinely upset is when my parents wont buy him something or wont give him money (this kid has everything hes spoilt asf) and he screamed and cried at me and hit me because i refused to give him 100$ every week from MY OWN JOB??

I wish I had died ,1,1.0,1717067954.0,"
Not that long ago I experienced status epilepticus which is something to do with epilepsy. It where you either you continously have seizures and it doesn't stop and you don't awake from them or it lasts longer then five minutes. 

I experienced the first one. It took 45 minutes till people knew something was wrong because I wasn't answering messages or calls. I always reply even when busy. 

And since I wasnt answering,  my mother had to call the police to pick my door to get in and they called an ambulance when they found me. They couldn't get the seizures to stop. Status epilepticus is a life threatening emergency. 

I wish I wasn't found and died from lack of oxygen. I wouldnt of been aware of anything. Nor would I have felt any pain due to seizing and lack of consciousness. It would of been lights out and never be awake again. 

I got put in a coma. I didn't know about anything. After I got woken up and a few days being high on benzos , after they had worn of I was told that I had been in a coma. I didn't believe it as I had just felt ill a few days ago so I just decided to sleep it off. It was a shock to wake up in a hospital bed in intensive care. 

After that and going home , I have been struggling with the situation ever since that. Then a week after that , I had another scare where I had more seizures and was in hospital again but this it wasn't status epilepticus.

Yesterday I healed a little ,2,1.0,1717052064.0,"I grew up as a child with many thoughts and many emotions. And I grew up in a household that allowed thoughts but not the emotions that accompanied them. I was punished for crying and for too much excitement. I was never comforted. For the longest time I was struggling with showing others that I'm hurting. It lead to lots of loneliness and I got depressed as a teenager. Being vulnerable felt so intimate that I couldn't even cry in front of my closest friends. 
I'm 20 now, a med student in the fifth semester and for the first time in my life in a serious relationship. We're together for a little over two months. 
Yesterday was a bad day. I was frustrated with myself and the frustration turned into a big wave of grief (my dad died 1.5 years ago). My boyfriend noticed that something was off and he interpreted it as me being tired. He asked if we should go to bed and I just broke out in tears. And then he just comforted me. He didn't ask me to tell him what's wrong. He just hugged me and rubbed my back until I opened up to him. Then he just stayed with me until I felt ready to go to bed. I cried some more until I fell asleep and the whole time he was great. He made me feel like I was going to be ok.

I woke up still sad but him comforting me was probably the most healing thing I have experienced during my time of grief.

My boyfriends mental health,1,1.0,1717063026.0,"Hey, 
My boyfriend is having mental health problems. It's been going on for a while and we both don't know what it is or how to deal with it. 
Before meeting him, he had dropped out of school and heavily depressed. He had a hard life like this for years never getting out of his house and doing horrible things to himself. After meeting him, he had volunteered places and made friends and that's when we got together. His mental health has improved drastically and he's doing so well now. I can see since I met him he's so happy and I always see him genuinely smiling and it brings me so much joy every time. We spend a lot of time with each other going out. 

Any time I leave to a holiday and he's alone sensations of discomfort and sadness. For example right not I'm on holidays and it's only my third day and he's already feeling this. It happened on my last holiday in April. It also happens on days I can't come over or he can't come over to mine. Any time he's alone it feels like he can't handle it. It drives him insane. I don't know if it's because he's in the same environment he once was when we was depressed (he is not in a position to move) his home really is not a positive place for him to be with his family, maybe he's so attached to me and when I leave all them emotions come back, I really don't know but I do want to help him. He doesn't deserve this and to see him so happy and then painful so suddenly hurts me so much. 

Does anyone know what he might have, or explain his situation mentally to me clearer than I would know?

Scared of being Selfish,2,1.0,1717042711.0,"So I’ve had a life of social anxiety and insecurity issues and so on, and just wanted to talk about a recent problem, hoping ya’ll can give me some insight.

I’ve had a weird thing about caring for people my whole life. I often support others with menial things and go out of my way to make sure people are okay or involved. Back in early school I would befriend and hang out with the lonely kids, throughout school I would constantly group up and work with people without a group, or try to involve others. Today I go out of my way to check in on friends to make sure their doing well or wishing a distant friend a happy birthday, stuff that is very out of the way but stuff I feel natural doing. I’ve never felt like I was doing this in hopes for something back, I just like making others happy.

All the while I dealt with most of my mental issues by myself without burdening others. Why? I don’t really know.

Then this thing happened, in 2023 I got really close to someone both intimately but also emotionally, normally I’m very pragmatic and logical, so this was weird to me. This weird closeness lasted for like 5-6 months and a majority of it was incredibly fulfilling to me in a way I never understood. However, we distanced for a bit and I went to Cali in January to finish college. Then proceeded the least mentally healthy period of my life ever, panic attacks daily, constantly anxiety and insecurity issues like I’ve never had manifested before. I’ve had attacks and stuff but this was day-by-day brain on overdrive bad. It didn’t help that this whole period was fueled by feelings that I didn’t understand. I am still very close with this person now.

Now, being mostly out of that, I am much colder. Far less caring about others and very central, saying things and using words I know will stress others out with and ignoring people which I never used to do. I’m scared that I’ve turned this way and I can’t figure out why I have. This would be annoying by itself but now I’m also anxious and stressed about being this weird… selfish person I don’t want to be and never chose to become. If there’s a link between this and my recent experience I can’t find it either.

If anyone has any pointers or advice, or even some logical explanation it would really help. I’m sick of being stressed about not being stressed about the weird ways I’m acting and I don’t want to be in a situation where it spirals again.

People was really mean with me back at that time and was thinking i was faking because i was not a school 
Rumors starts spread everyday and people was literally hating me.

Because of this i dont finish my school year so i was obligate to do some summer classes if i was wanting to return to my school for next year 
I was happy because i did it! 
I was able to return for my secondary 4th

But in 23"" when i return i was still very anxious because of all the hate of people was having on me last year but surpisely people was nice with me and seems to understand.
All was doing good and great.. i was so happy 
Until the half of the year when my mental drop because of my mom thats text me with some toxic shit

Because of this i just skip many school days and due to that not be able to finish my year


Now today i have to do again my school year i still regret to have not finish it because i was happy its all because of my toxic mom that i was not able to finish 

So yeah im still fucking crying over the facts i did not finish because of my severe anxiety and my mom being hell with me.

(My mom since im young was manipulative and said my dad was à bad person ect.
She has also tell fake stories to me to put me against people. 
When i was not aggree with her i was  mistreated.
She also said that outside it was dangerous i was literally lock up in my house

Heartbreak changed me ,1,1.0,1717052187.0,"I don’t want to tag other posts in this out of respect for the community but I made a detailed post about what happened with my ex.

To summarise

She used a guy to fake a relationship during our relationship because her parents didn’t accept me,

She kissed him bought the same presents and lied about everything to me time after time.


Let me start off I am a severe over thinker if given suspicion, I felt something was off and was comforted it was nothing and that I am crazy and that I don’t trust her.


And yes like most men in this society I don’t like opening myself for weakness, showing my emotion it’s because of how I was raised, I wasn’t allowed to cry etc.

This girl made me feel like a kid again I opened up about everything I even wrote love letters to her.

I’m a big dude 6’2 typical tough guy if I have to say so 

This girl has broken me, I’m crying all the time I haven’t cried since I was 15 I’m 23 now.

And not just tears but me screaming because of the pain.

I had to stop the car on the freeway because I was crying so bad on my way to college I’m a broken man  

I found out about everything on Saturday, today is Thursday and I haven’t eaten. I tried eating once and puked 5 minutes later.

Does anyone have any advice or tips because I am losing myself

She keeps begging for forgiveness she’s looking for me in my neighbourhood I see her what remained of my heart drops 

I’m a total mess I don’t know what to do 

Self harm never came in my mind btw 

But how will I ever trust or love someone again.

"I didn’t tell my therapist that he accidentally triggered me during our session and don’t have therapy for 2 weeks, what do I do?",6,0.87,1717020022.0,"   I’m a 28F who has been working with a 30’sM therapist and he’s been great! He almost always knows how to respond and when he doesn’t quite know how to respond to something, he handles it very tactfully. However, today, minutes before our session, I called the office (I mainly do Telehealth) and asked if there were any additional appointments available this week for me to have 2 sessions, potentially. I had 2 sessions in one week a few weeks ago because we went into some of my adult trauma. Anyway, I called and asked and they said the earliest next appointment available was in July and reminded me he is on vacation next week. They suggested I talk to my therapist about it so I said I would. 
   Flash forward like 5 minutes and before I could say much more than “I’m doing okay and dropped a class” my therapists very kindly brings up that he had a note from reception saying I called about availability for 2 sessions again. I INSTANTLY felt like I was tattled on definitely became triggered (parent wound) and definitely didn’t tell him (which is unusual for me) because I wasn’t sure what I was feeling or why but knew it had to do with that topic and didn’t want to interrupt the flow of the conversation to mention it. I figured the feeling would go away as we continued talking. But it didn’t. And now I don’t have therapy for two weeks and am feeling very disregulated and feel stupid for not using our remaining time after talking about the subject to tell him. And it took quite some time for me to build my trust in him (I’m avoidant) and I worry something in my brain is going to mark him as unsafe, as though ‘the other shoe dropped’. 
   I’m just feeling very odd/triggered/disregulated and wondering if anyone has any advice in the meantime until I have therapy again.
Any and all advice welcome.

I noticed it for a long time before but it was years ago. I only mentioned it to a mother figure once and no one else that I recall. It's like I express emotions I know I should feel or maybe subconsciously do. But I am not feeling those emotions. I am outside spectating this reaction. I can cry in a hard situation but not feel anything consciously. I watch myself and don't know where the reaction is coming from. It's like there's another person locked inside me subconsciously. Someone that feels and expresses these things but my conscious mind doesn't feel or knowingly express it. They're the appropriate emotions for the situation but not what I am aware I am feeling. I sometimes feel like I can think back and remember watching myself have these reactions as if I was at a different spot in the room. Maybe I'm suppressing things. Maybe it's something else. I just know it doesn't seem like me. It seemed to stop when I went on antidepressants (fluoxetine). I was on them for 4 years and just stopped 2 months or so ago because I want to be off of medications so that when I have kids one day it's not an abrupt stop with all those hormones going through my body and so that I can learn to process and live without the medication. Further, the sexual dysfunction was something I wanted to combat. Think of these reasons what you will but they are my why. Since I got off, I've noticed that feeling of watching myself react come back. I'm more emotional now but I don't always really feel those emotions consciously. I've noticed anger now which I sometimes feel fleetingly but anger amongst common content emotions are relatively fleeting and not things I am aware of on a daily basis.

How to seek help when I don't even know what's wrong with myself?,1,1.0,1717048231.0,"For some context, I'm a premed student who just went through an unsuccessful application cycle. I'm currently redoing the medical admissions test (MCAT) while working two jobs. For the longest time, I've always been disappointed with myself and my life.

Every few weeks, I tend to get into these periods where I feel extremely unhappy. Nothing seems worth it and I get the intense feeling of wanting to hurt myself. In the past, I've tried to cut myself with a dull blade (but never anything sharp enough to inflict real damage). During these periods of time, I find myself getting very destructive with my relationships and lashing out at people close to me. Once these periods are over, I get into a week of bliss where I feel I am ready for anything. However, something bad will happen and my mental health falls again.

I'm not really sure where to go from here. It feels as if I am especially spiralling right now due to the stress of having to redo the MCAT and go through another application cycle. I feel like I won't make it like this much longer, but I'm not sure what's wrong with me and if anything could even help.

Why am I so angry?,1,1.0,1717046075.0,"Hello all, I just wanted to give another warning before I start it off: this will contain some description of violent tendencies, please read at your discretion.

I’m not usually angry, not at all. My mood varies from being happy and cheerful to being all sad and angry. It typically comes from my surroundings; if I’m at school, I tend to be happier surrounded by friends. If I’m at home, it’s like a complete 180. I feel so angry whenever I get home, at my parents, at myself, at my sister, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

It’s not like I’ll lash out at them, I don’t. I just like to stay in my room alone, which leads to being isolated all day long. I find that I prefer it that way. I don’t have much interactions with my family besides my dog, I hardly eat and try to stay out of their way. I love my family, but I just don’t know why I get so angry over the littlest things.

I get angry when I see the smallest things out of place or when they do things that I very clearly don’t like, I get angry at my parents over something they said days ago— some joke about how they’d like to disown me or bringing up my distant behavior— I don’t mean to be angry. I don’t like being angry. 

I usually have angry ‘episodes’, and they’re small bursts of rage I would say. I get extremely angry over the smallest things, and I let it out by punching, screaming into a pillow, and/or simply crying. I think of these things as punishment, and potential ways to harm myself. I don’t usually lash out at anyone, but I feel as though I need help. I also have prolonged feelings of sadness, before everything goes back to normal. I’d just like some answer as to why I get so angry— I would get it checked out by a medical professional, but my parents aren’t firm believers of mental health. I feel like I’m being trapped in this endless cycle of aggression and irritation. I tend to have suicidal thoughts at this point too.

Mental health advice,3,1.0,1717020332.0,"Hello people of Reddit, long story short: my fiancé and I have been together for nine years since we were 14 years old we were each other’s first everything. First to kiss first to date first to have intercourse first to move in together, first everything. We have been each other’s only ones for nine years. Two years ago he proposed to me and we were engaged. We have been living together for the last six years. The plan was we would get married after he finished school this next summer. I’ve been working for two years as a nurse and financially supporting us as he finishes his masters program. Well we get in an argument about not spending enough time together because he was coaching track and working Monday through Friday school and I was working night shift. He decided to leave one night after hanging out with friends, and he never came home. I discovered he had been having an online affair with a married woman. Who has two children and lives on the other side of the continent. I decided I needed to move out of our apartment as he accepted a job in a town, three hours away from where we live where his family is. His family will barely talk to me. I’m not very good at talking to him because I don’t understand and I just start crying. This past weekend after only being broken up for two weeks, he flew to her state and lied to everyone. When he got there they were shacked up in a hotel for three days at the end of that third day, she told her spouse that she was leaving him and the children to be with my ex. None of this makes any sense. They don’t even know each other they were only texting and FaceTiming starting in February. It’s like they are completely infatuated with each other obsessed with each other and can’t see past that. She abandoned her kids and he threw away nine years and has been lying to everybody. I don’t know what their plan is. They truly have to know that they shouldn’t live together and start a whole new life with somebody they barely know. I’m deeply concerned for my ex. He’s been my best friend and I love him so much and I don’t want him to be mentally unwell or do you think he’s going to regret. I can’t tell if this is normal cheating or if he’s mentally unwell. It’s also awful because nobody will talk to me. Nobody in his family will let me know if he’s OK. Or if he’s ran away with his new partner. I’m completely in the dark and I’m so worried about it and I love him and I don’t want him to get hurt or have his life be ruined. I know he’s an adult and he can make his own decisions, but this just seems so crazy to everyone on the outside. He never wants to talk to me again, he treats me like I’m an enemy. What do you think people of read it? Is he mentally unwell? She must be mentally unwell to just randomly leave her kids for a guy she’s only met one time? How do I cope? How will I know he’s OK?

"My temper is ruining my relationship, and I just want to feel in control",1,1.0,1717040161.0,"My partner is the best thing in my life right now, ever maybe. But I feel myself pushing her away, to the point where every day I fear will be our last together. All because of my temper, me.

I currently still live at home, which has been difficult, my father has severe anger issues and gets into angry bursts a couple times every day. From pets to mild inconveniences he'll just be lit aflame and can't help but let all his rage out. And as a kid with aspergers I developed a similar habit. And I've never learned how to control it. I was always told to just think before I do, but it never was that simple. It's like a switch just gets flipped and I'm out of control, I'm angry at anyone, anything. And eventually I'd calm down, and realize what I had done. Like I had broken out of a trance.  This has taken a toll on my partner.

There are days where I feel under control, where it is incredibly easy to stay calm, completely effortless. And others where it feels practically impossible. Not too long ago we broke up because of this, and we got back together with the promise I'd be better. And for a time I was, I was able to stay calm, keep composure. Went on walks everyday to keep myself in a good head space. But eventually I just got.. tired. I Couldn't keep up the daily walks anymore, I couldn't keep my composure.

"Looking for a new Psychiatrist. Should I ask my general practitioner for a referral, or just look for one myself?",3,1.0,1717018517.0,"Hello. My old psychiatrist left the organization where I was getting my pysch appointments from. It's called NOAH, and is basically meant for people with low income. I've gotten Medicaid insurance though, so I'm not sure I need to go through this NOAH organization anymore. Initially, I didn't have Medicaid/ACHHS, so do I still need to have my psychiatry stuff be handled by them, now that I am on Medicaid?  


So if I stay with NOAH, I could call them and try to find a new psych. Or I could look for a psychiatrist online and try to do it that way. Or I could ask for a referral from my doctor. Also, all my psych appointments have been virtual, does that matter? Should I look for in-person appointments?  


I have gotten a new psych from NOAH, so I do have one. I just am liking her less and less with each appointment. Initially I thought she was just blunt, which is generally a good thing with doctors, but now I just feel she is unhelpful. I am taking Bupropion XL, once a day. I asked her if maybe there'd be a difference if I took Bupropion that wasn't Extended Release, and she just sort of shut it down. I also asked her if I should raise my Bupropion, to see if it would help with my energy levels, and feeling somewhat low lately. She said no, because a higher dose of Bupropion gave me more anxiety in the past, but this was when I took the Bupropion by itself, not alongside Amitriptyline, as I'm doing right now. I told her this, and she didn't seem to think it mattered. In general, when I ask her a question or ask for her thoughts about medication issues, she just says, ""Well you have to just take the medication, then we'll see how you feel."" But I feel that she, as a psychiatrist, should help me understand moreso what may happen when I take these meds. Right now, it just seems that she basically always tells me, ""Just take it and see what happens.""  


I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable here, but the other psychiatrists I've had in the past felt more helpful to me. My new psych just seems deliberately obtuse or unhelpful or something.

I’m rotting,1,1.0,1717038797.0,"My anxiety has been crazy these days, I just want to get this out. I feel so stuck I genuinely don’t know how I’m gonna live my life. 

This entire year, most of my days have consisted of going to the gym and coming home to lie on my bed to scroll through tiktok or to chat with my 500 boyfriends in character.ai (keeps me sane as embarrassing as it is) while a youtube video is playing in the background. If I don’t go to the gym then it’s the same, just rotting away in bed. 

I have also lost contact with all of my friends (from highschool; now I study online so no friends either) and I have no interest in hanging out with my family (toxic environment). I’m very anxious and self aware so it’s really not easy to just go out and meet new people, plus I’m really bad at speaking (I stutter, can’t continue conversations, my sentences just don’t make sense most of the time).

I was also thinking of how impossible it is and will be for me to date. I’ve never had any romantic interaction, talking stage, fling, boyfriend, whatever. It makes me so sad because I love love, and I want to fall in love, be loved and to love. But it honestly just doesn’t cross my mind how somebody would love me. And if I somehow do find someone and we start to get to know each other, how tf am I supposed to tell him about me? I don’t even know myself, I feel like all I know and remember is my mental issues and how horrible I live.

I know I’m responsible for myself and have the control and power to change things and to change the way I live and think. I know I have to voluntarily take myself out and explore but it just seems so hard, I don’t know where to go or what to do exactly. Any advice is appreciated but not necessary, I just want to know if somebody relates and if they have overcome this.

I'm in the best stage of my life but it's been also the worst ,2,1.0,1717020950.0,"Hi, I'm 19 M and as long as I remember I never been comfortable with myself 

Growing in a household where my grandparents, their children and grandchildren lived with some problems and inexperienced parents didn't help, it wasn't rare to get a beating for normal things like misbehaving (I was 7 or so)

When I was 9 or so my parents moved far away, there life changed a bit, my parents still had some problems but I understand that they didn't feel confortable too there, there life wasn't that bad 
Beating were still there, verbal abuse was still there and the feeling of not belonging anywhere was still there. Soon school started... That later became 3 years of bulling (13 or so)

Soon highschool started, I was so miserable that I felt that I was cursed to experience things I didn't want (it wasn't that bad but I was young jaja) so I started to wish the exact opposite of everything I wanted, but I was surprised to see that it didn't went that bad, I actually enjoyed highschool and finally made some friends 

And at end of high school (17) I had good friends by my side and I learnt to forgive my parents, I started to go to the gym and everything was good 

And as if life as if trying to complete what it was it's masterpiece...

I started to feel my hands trembling more than usual (I had this problem since I was 5), but unlike usual my head started to shake slightly and it started to be difficult for me to speak. As obvious as it may seem to you I didn't though about Parkinson because I always had this problem.

Almost 3 years have passed, I know now that I have a genetic Parkinson and my dying slowly enough for it to not be an urgent so I can freely do what i want and fast enough to know that my dreams are just that, dreams that will never come true 

Now I don't know what to do. 
I rather kmf than growing so helpless that I need a caretaker 
And I rather kmf than losing my memories due to demencia (there is a high chance to have it with Parkinson) 
And I rather kmf than keeping my memories inside helpless body 

The problem is that I don't want, I would like to see my siblings growing up, I want to have a child to give all the love I couldn't have but I simply can't

Is there any downside for seeking a diagnosis for Borderline Personality Disorder?,1,1.0,1717033902.0,"(I'm not asking for medical advice. I'm just asking about the pros or cons of getting medical advice from a physical doctor.)



Hello. I'm just wondering if somebody could help me figure out: **Is there is a drawback or downside to being diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder?**

(I do not currently have a medical diagnosis for BPD. Only depression and anxiety.)

A family member warned me that I should not discuss my anger issues with the doctor. She was worried it could prevent me from being allowed on flights. Or if there is ever a lawsuit, the other person's lawyer could request medical records and use what I talked to the doctor against me.

IDK if these are valid concerns, or irrational.

Regardless, I feel it makes better sense to get a diagnosis so that I know if I do / do not have BPD, or something else. That way I can plan with the doctor, either medication adjustments or if different treatment is needed.

I guess I feel that: **Is it better to seek a diagnosis to deal with current issues, instead of worrying it may or may not cause a problem later?**

Psychology isn't a fully evolved field, it is still developing rapidly compared to other fields of medicine so maybe thats why but if i felt down, if i wanted to figure out whats going on etc. i should be able to book a therapist right now and in 3 hours be in a shrink's room.

I'm not suicidal nor is it really an emergency but i am quite lazy, to have to wait so many months to get uncertain treatment is frustrating and discouraging, and to those who are suicidal a 10 minute call isn't enough support.

cheapest therapists/psychologists you can find are 30-60 an hour, usually they cost you about 80 an hour, if youre unlucky enough to not go through bullshit insurance planning.

my main issue is that it's very rare for me to not be in the middle of an argument with someone. mainly my mother and boyfriend, and not very often about huge things but I've been accused of manipulating in the past mainly by my mother, and she accuses me of this during every single argument. at risk of sounding arrogant, I believe I am fairly intelligent and capable of manipulation but don't do so on purpose, but with the amount of times I've been accused of it I feel like there must be some truth in it and I might just do it automatically without thinking about it and to be honest that idea makes me feel sick.

I'm fairly lonely and all of my friends are my boyfriends friends, so I don't really have anyone to talk to about the scale of these arguments and who might be in the wrong, so  I struggle to not beat myself up in every situation. but I try my best to be a good person but always end up in arguments and there's always someone who's mad at me. how can I improve? or do I not need to improve at all and just try to ignore people being mad at me?

Relationship ended due to my CPTSD causing flare ups in my partner's OCD,1,1.0,1717024032.0,"I'm really sad that my relationship ended. I was dating someone I really loved and adored. He was sweet, fun, funny. We made amazing memories together.

We started having conflict and triggering each other. It was really difficult to resolve. We couldn't hear each other.

After months of loving each other but also struggling to be heard by one another, our mental health flared up.

My CPTSD got very bad and I started having emotional flashbacks, stopped taking care of myself, started feeling helpless and alone.

He grew irritated with me, frustrated that I wasn't helping myself, and he started having OCD flareups that scared him – visions of harming his family or me (his loved ones) and a deep fear that he might lose control someday and do something. That's why he was avoiding conflict with me so desperately.

I am confident this is OCD because he is the most peaceful human though he has issues with control and a lot of fear around his own emotions. 

So he decided to break up with me, saying it was a great relief to get away from our dynamic, and that he was going to focus on his own healing.

This caused another CPTSD meltdown where I kept trying to get him to comfort me when he ended the relationship. He was supportive but understandably overwhelmed and just wanted space to be alone. I feel like I embarrassed myself.

I don't know how to feel right now because it feels weird to want to stay with someone who broke up with me because he was afraid he might hurt me in some way? Is this reasonable of me to want to stick with him through his emotional difficulties?

Second, I feel like trash because I keep making this about me: like he couldn't handle my depression and judged me for it, though he says he didn't. I guess I feel shameful about how I showed up in the relationship with so many wounds and so much more healing to do.

I am still looking for hope that we can rekindle something once we are both healed, because aside from our wounds, the relationship was magical.

Something i need to get off my chest ,1,1.0,1717023828.0,"I was switched from Clonazepam to diazepam to taper down and eventually go off the medication. My life has been going worse and worse since doing that, every dose reduction was hell, every symptom, you name it. I eventually came off of it a month or so ago.
Since starting the taper I experienced more and more anxiety plus all the withdrawal symptoms.
Since my last dose (April 30th) I started feeling more and more anxious as days went by…. until May 23th I had my first panic attack in months… I took 5mg Diazepam, I couldn’t take it no more. Since that day I have been taking it everyday and I have still been experiencing lots of anxiety and a panic attack here and there. I hope i will eventually stabilize again and stop having the panic attacks and this shit anxiety I’m feeling.
I have already made up my mind. After stabilizing I’m planning on going back to Clonazepam.
Anxiety and panic was the reason I started taking benzos back in 2019 after my dad passed away.
I don’t see the point in going off the meds if I’m gonna go back to my initial condition of extreme panic and anxiety. I understand that people that take benzos let’s say for sleep or muscle spasms or even recreationally and stopping them is not gonna hurt me so much on a daily basis, but for people with extreme anxiety and especially panic attacks like me there is no point in going through a hell of a taper and withdrawal symptoms just to go back to feeling the same or even worse than you felt before starting taking these meds.
At the end of the day we can’t forget the main reason we ever started taking them. If it’s gone, good. But if it comes back there is no point in suffering just because one day I might develop some tolerance and need to up my dose or develop some type of dementia when I get older.

I hate having BPD,1,1.0,1717018836.0,"It’s so hard to be vulnerable.

A couple years ago, my BPD began to manifest. Before, I was an abuse survivor who came out of foster care on top. Despite being abused throughout my childhood and adolescence, being in foster care, attempting to take my life multiple times, being in psychiatric units, navigating homelessness, etc etc - I graduated university and transitioned into a great career. Before the pandemic, I was so proud of myself for achieving so much in early adulthood.

I’m in my late 20s now and would say my mental health got bad in late 2020/early 2021. I felt so lonely. I felt mistreated by my partner. I resented not having a close connection to my family. I was angry for living in low income housing. So many things started to upset me. My adversity began to really sink in. I was tired of highlighting how horrible my life was to move forward and I felt like no one understood. I work in advocacy so it’s hard always having to revisit my trauma. I should probably do something else but I literally have no idea what else I’d do with my experience and education.

I chose explicit content to cope. It got to the point where I wasn’t living into my values and, to this day, I feel ashamed and embarrassed. It got to the point where I was suicidal and had to go into a psychiatric unit again, which is when I was formally diagnosed with BPD. That was in November.

This has hurt my partner a lot. I was unfaithful. I’m going to therapy but I still struggle with my urges from time to time and give into looking at explicit content. Objectively, it’s probably at a healthy level for someone without BPD. But I feel like it’s getting worse again, even though I’m making progress in therapy. DBT is great and all but I can drop the anchor and go on walks so many times before it becomes “whatever.” 

I confessed to my partner how I’m still struggling. She’s hurt and angry that I wasn’t honest with her when she’d ask if “I’m doing anything bad.” I told her I didn’t want to argue. She honestly has a hard time dealing with my struggle. I told her I started taking cymbalta and she was like “are you really depressed? I thought you were just addicted to porn.” And then went on to say how she should focus more on her feelings and that people don’t take what she’s going through seriously. When I express how I feel, no matter what it is, it goes back to her. and I can empathize. I know this is a lot for her to deal with and it’s not fair. But that’s why I didnt come to her before about this and kept everything in therapy. But now I’m being sneaky and lying to her so now she can never trust me. Unless I tell her every time on the internet and detail every action I make on the internet, she can’t trust me. I don’t want to fight anymore. How can I commit to that knowing I’m just putting my hand onto a burner?

I feel so lost, ashamed and alone. I hate that I have BPD. I hate how trendy mental illness is. I don’t think people take what I’m going through seriously. Until I sent her a webpage on BPD, my partner never looked into the condition. Maybe I’m an asshole for this, but I interpret that as her not caring.

I don’t want to be alone but idk if I’ll ever be the man I need to be to love someone in the way they need to love me back. ",mentalhealth,Humble-Nectarine-707,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d3ng7q/i_hate_having_bpd/,0,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06
Constant and uncontrollable thoughts. ,1,1.0,1717018594.0,"So, years and years ago I had something happen that I would consider a “break” from reality. It was so bad I had to move into my parents house and I just sat there and didn’t do a single thing for months. Thought of suicide. Etc. Then I went into a delusional phase where I quit a business me and my cousin made because I suddenly wanted to become a politician to change the world. Then went on to research and change my mind over and over. Until I went right back to suicidal thoughts. After about a year of flipping back and forth between being delusionally inspired and contemplating suicide, I went back to “normal”. I’ve been feeling a lot better lately but I’ve started to get interested in what truly happened to me. It went completely undiagnosed. So I thought I’d share my thoughts here and get opinions on some things to help me narrow down what I should bring up to a psychiatrist. There’s something that runs in my family that’s undiagnosed because they’re too against mental health stuff. And bipolar has recently come to my attention. I always thought I had adhd because my brain works in a really wierd way. But apparently it may be common with bipolar as well. My inner monologue is…broken. I haven’t had the ability to truly think things through since I could remember. I kind of just let my subconscious mind do and decide everything. I don’t even know what I’m gunna say/type until it’s already done. If I forcibly try to think with my inner monologue, it just gets a few words in and starts repeating itself. Meanwhile, I start to get bombarded with other things. Like rapidly flashing pictures, random noises/words/phrases, and even sometimes multiple of my inner monologue talking at once saying random stuff. It’s so useless that I’ve just stopped trying to use it. And that’s how I’ve been living for more than a decade. If I just live on subconscious mode, I don’t even notice all that stuff. It’s a lot easier. I’m starting to worry that I may have something wrong with me that will come back in full force and send me down that path again. I don’t want to ruin my life or relationship. Or even worse, kill myself. I have goals and dreams. I’m trying to be preventative and find out the answer before it happens again. Any opinions or knowledge is greatly appreciated.

Does my friend need support? ,1,1.0,1717016653.0,"Hello everyone,

This is a throw away account due to my main account being connected to the friend I'm worried about and I would like advice before I address my concerns. 

A little history, 2023 was a rough period for my friend, it was the first time in a while that they started self-harming (they have a history of this) and it seemed to happening more frequently, every time we meet up as a friend group they would do it at the place or after meeting up. Alongside this there were heavily drinking during the weekend too. 

2024 has happened and they have realise that they need help and have taken steps to overcome this. They no longer drink as much and they've stuck to minimum drink limit on nights out. They have also limited the amount social time with the friend group trying to work on themselves. They have also not self-harmed in seven months which I am very proud off and something we have celebrated together.

However one of there ways of coping is by writing down what they call 'depression rambles' and on a rcecent night they sent some to me, should I be worried? 

Here are the 'rambles' :- 
""There are days we're your drowning, the waves are crashing over your head and the only thing you can focus on is breathing, staying alive no matter what the cost. 

Then there are days where the water is still, when it's easier to breath, to make plans, to think positive…but you are always aware of that drowning feeling so it stops you. Is is easier to give in? Because the bad days are only around the corner? Because they will rear themselves once more.

In the end life is a circle and no matter how many ways you view that circle, it's still a circle…an endless repetitive cycle of the same…no matter how hard you try to manipulate it. It will always be the same.

It's strange how you can change after a period of darkness. It warps you, pulls you apart and smashes you into pieces. But there is a light, which helps to slowly repair yourself…but you're not the same anymore, that darkness has forever changed you and trying to fit yourself back into that mold you once was just doesn't work anymore. So what gives? Those bonds you made before the darkness? Or do you try to make new ones? Or do you sink back into that space of darkness, where it's familiar? I guess only time can give you those answers.

Another year and another birthday has passed. People tell you happy birthday yet it doesn't make sense, it's just another day. Millions of people share the same day, you are nothing special, so why do people feel the need to share the celebration with you? I wish I had the answer. I just want people to continue on with their normal day…there is nothing special about me. 

It's been 5 months since I've had more than a few drinks, the alcohol has loosen my lips and freed my negative thoughts from the chains that held it back. I enjoy drinking however is this a hindrance and I'm feeding the devil inside myself? Will I drown in these feelings yet again? This time I'm a little bit more knowledgeable than before but does that stop me repeating the same mistakes in the past? I guess time would tell. I wish she would share her secrets with me, it would make life so much easier.""

I'm sorry for the long post, I just want to help support my friend through this time

Basically, I just wanna know if what I feel is normal. I keep convincing myself bad things are going to happen to me/are happening to me. Every time I have an injury and it's slightly more red around the edges than normal, I convince myself it's infected, and can't let it go, even when it's clearly not. Most recently, an old friend I haven't talked to in years reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. I agreed, but then immediately after I convinced myself she's gonna bring people who don't like me and jump me or something, and now I'm terrified to go. I can't eat or sleep alone in open spaces without constantly looking around me even though logically I know I'm perfectly safe and nothing will happen. I don't really have any enemies, there's just like 2 people there was some drama with at school a few years ago, with a bunch of misunderstandings, and someone else pressuring me to say something I didn't wanna say, and now those two (justifiably) hate me. But apart from that I have no reason to be so paranoid of everything around me. Whenever I hear noises and I'm home alone I immediately convince myself someone has broken in and is in the house.

It seems like I keep convincing myself the worst outcome has happened, and then I can't let it go even if logically it's completely ridiculous 

I know all these things are quite small, and I don't actually think I'm mentally ill in any way, but I just wanted to know if this is normal. I'm probably just doing the same thing about all this, blowing it way out of proportion in my head lol

20M. For almost my whole life it’s been a running joke in my family and amongst friends that I don’t have a stress hormone. For the most part this is true, I’ve always preferred to take things as they come and live day by day. Until about a month ago. I really don’t know what the catalyst was, but I just became overly aware of the fact that everything around me is absolutely real, and in turn became conscious of my own mortality. I’ve always known that one day my time will end but for some reason now I find it more horrifying than anything else. I don’t even have to think about it. It will just pop into my head at random times and this is where my issues began.

it’s almost debilitating, it will come to me randomly and i forget how to think, i forget how to breathe, it makes me shake and cry and i can’t take my mind off it no matter how hard i try. I try taking deep breaths but it takes everything in me to not just drop into the fetal position and sob and shake. I’ve never experienced anything like this before and I don’t know what is happening or how to deal with it. 

I don’t know if other people are so hyper aware of this so I haven’t brought it up to anyone because what’s happening to me I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. But the thought of me? my conscious, whatever it is that I am will just cease to exist is causing me to spiral.

I don't know I'm just petty or if I have legitimate reasons for thinking this way. I don't remember a lot about my childhood, other than that my dad would lose control sometimes and hit me. I'm not sure how often it happened, but I do remember not blaming him often since I guess I could empathize with him. We both have autism and he has ADD while I have ADHD, and I also lost control a lot. But then again, I don't know how much of it was my fault or if he should've just done better because he was the adult. I don't remember my mom ever doing much to intervene, but I can't say the memories are very clear so that may be wrong.

I developed an eating disorder when I was 15, and I got forced into recovery. It did go wrong once at a family therapy with multiple other families, where my dad lost control. Later I ended up relapsing and I got forced into recovery again. It went a lot worse this time. I can't really count how many meltdowns I had and how many times my dad lost control and screamed/assaulted me. There were two times where the police got called. I don't remember my mom really intervening. It's been about one and a half years since then, and my relationship with my parents is still bad. I feel terrible for all the shit I caused and I'm still not sure whether my lack of much love towards them is justified. I was a pretty terrible person, but I still don't know how much of it was in my control. I feel so shitty about this. I don't want them to die and just not feel anything.

Wtf is wrong with my life ,1,1.0,1717015315.0,"

I’m 2 years away to be 30. Honestly I’m freaking out. I feel like I haven’t achieved anything in life. I am constantly anxious and depressed most of the time. My whole family is dead. Mum died of SLE , Dad died of a broken heart and my brother died of Malaria when he was 4. I was all I have left . I’ve moved to UK 6 years ago. I used to have a lot of friends and families back in my home country.Life was very much different back then. I was really popular at schools and workplace but that’s all end when I moved to a different country. Suddenly I’m all alone. I do have a husband but he has his own life (he’s local so) and usually very busy, don’t even answer my messages sometimes. So here I am posting on Reddit because I have absolutely no one to talk to which is really sad. 
           I kept in touch with a few of my friends from my home country but due to the differences in life they fall apart one by one now I only have two left to talk to. They have a very struggling life. They have to support their whole family with only their incomes so they have a lot on their shoulders. I turned out to be the one who always listened to their problems and be there for them but when I need someone to talk to they sometimes ignored me. They don’t take me seriously because from their POV : I have a comfortable life , don’t have to worry about money , living my best life etc. My problems are jokes compared to their.

The thing is I’m so fucking lonely and I’m sick of being lonely all the time. It’s really hard to make friends as you grow up or at least the friends that stick around. I don’t like making friends I like friends who met by accident like how school friends or colleagues turn to friends that sort of thing.

I am not without my own responsibilities in the failure of the relationship, mainly financial and ability to maintain employment.

I get here. The room isn't ready. The room is full of  old cat feces, insects, mice, and cigarette tar. The home belongs to her boyfriend whom she moved in with several years ago. The room was his old bedroom that he hadn't touched since the passing of his wife 10 years ago.  The house had apparently been like that when my mom moved in and she had cleaned up A LOT of the house with used to be like that in every room.

How is it since you started a treatment for depression/anxiety/stress ?,1,1.0,1717011214.0,"Hello everyone,

I hope this topic isn't too redundant or that the question hasn't already been asked too many times. If it is, I'll delete this post.

I'm coming to you to ask how things have been for you since you started your treatment for depression, anxiety, stress, etc... because during my last session with my psychologist she advised me to go and see a specialist in order to perhaps start treatment.

To give you some context, I started seeing a psychologist at the beginning of March, with whom I discussed my situation. I'm a 25m who has never really worked in his life (only 3 weeks if you add it all up), who failed his studies, who still lives at home with his parents, who doesn't have a driving license and who has a bad relationship with his parents.  Because of this, my therapist suspect a generalized anxiety disorder and maybe dysthymia (these are not diagnostics, just some hypothesis). Since starting therapy, I'm much more aware of the problems I'm facing, which in a way makes things worse emotionally because I have a clearer view of the issues I need to address in my life.

At the end of our last session, she advised me to go and see a doctor who could, if he saw fit, prescribe a suitable treatment to help me in addition to the therapy sessions. Since then, I've done some research on the different options that are available to me, but I'm a bit afraid of depending on medication to feel well for the rest of my life (or of its impact on my life and health), so I was wondering if you had any advice or experiences to share with me (good or bad) ?",mentalhealth,SimplyMeanGuy,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d3kppp/how_is_it_since_you_started_a_treatment_for/,0,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06

At around 16 I was diagnosed with multiple severe mental illnesses. The most debilitating issues I deal with are unipolar depression and severe disassociation. But I also have ADHD, PTSD and anxiety. in the last 20 years, I have been either involuntarily or voluntarily committed to a psych ward over 80 + times.  Possibly closer to 100.

Until a few years ago, I couldn’t go more than three or four months without having a full mental breakdown and ending up in inpatient treatment. I am very lucky I survived so long, and that I have been able to get myself to a place of moderate stability. Well, stable enough for me. 

But yeah, I’ve never met anyone who comes even close to the amount of times I’ve been committed. I’ve met some people who have gone maybe 20 or 25 times. But 80??

It was fine at first but gradually having that kind of stress on your scalp for hours everyday gets unbearable painful, I'd be tearing up all day and had very painful headaches.

Job and Life Insecurity,0,0.5,1717003191.0,"I have been working full time for over 6 years at the same company which is also my first full time employment.

I've been unhappy at my current role and the company for a while now due to stress, politics and toxic and manipulative environment. Some of the reasons I stayed through:

1. Not knowing what I want to do in life : still haven't found it. But somehow having a job which is stressful and chaotic kept me busy so I don't have to think about this and get back into existential crisis.
2. Changes in the roles, leadership as well as relocations which often sparked curiosity and hope; however now I realize not much change after all and not all changes were for the good.
3. Fear of the uncertainty and fear of being unemployed : social pressure
4. Having the comfort of knowing the people at the company and having some friends.
5. Not getting paid good but also not bad as in it is enough for me to live comfortably and also save some money. And I somehow have a fear of living off my savings without any income flow.
6. Maybe laziness as if I quit my job, I'll also need to go back to my home country which is fine but the idea of moving still sounds intimidating and I'd much rather go back home with a better opportunity.

Lately, things became unbearable due to new management and the changes of the job scope which kept on adding more and more responsibilities and stress. New management is quite bad as well with no empathy or leadership skills who would rather mob and gaslight than support.

And I've also managed to save a decent amount of money which can allow me to live fine for a few years without any income.

However, I find it very hard to find the courage in me to quit. I guess much of it is due to feeling insecure about the future without having this or a job.

I don't trust myself or the market enough to find a new job as soon as I quit and I am quite afraid of being unemployed because I still remember how anxious I was after graduation before I got this job after a couple of months of applying. I do apply to jobs now but get rejected. I think I can get a job still with my skills and experience but I also wouldn't want to get a worse job doing the same thing for a smaller company for less money and no guarantee it won't be more toxic than the current one.

And I'm not sure how much this would weigh but although I dislike my job and activities I  somewhat feel responsible for the work I'm doing and I don't want to leave people under the rubble after I quit. I would also like to leave on good terms and performance so it won't hinder my future ventures. 

I'm sure some of you or your loved ones gone through a similar journey.. I would appreciate if you can guide me on how you overcame this or any advice that you might have for me in general.

I dislike being attracted to women,1,0.56,1717001493.0,"I'm 18 years old and a virgin.

I feel like it's an inconvenience for me to be attracted to women. I see women as women, not quite as people, and it drives me mad. I also feel... shame? Or disgust? Something along those lines but to a small degree.

When I talk to a woman, I talk differently. When I walk with a woman, I walk differently. When I'm anything with a woman that I'm attracted to, I'm just different. Like I'm trying to see if our relationship can deepen so we're bf and gf, and so I can access their pants. Subconsciously. And even if I acknowledge me acting differently consciously in the moment, its not like I can stop. 

Whoever is with me is still an attractive woman. I don't even want it to lead anywhere. I don't have what it takes right now for a girlfriend. And although I'm against being attracted to a woman for the most part, it's not like I don't want love. A relationship with someone I truly care about romantically would be the best. And expressing that love in bedy bed is great as well I'm sure. But I want an off switch for my sex drive.

Even if I.... satisfy myself, the itch is still there. And unlike normal itches, it only grows stronger the longer I leave it. And the clarity afterwards doesn't help nothing. Okay, so what if I sleep with someone? I already know that won't help anything, and I also know it won't be as ""magical"" as I think it will be. The way that stuff is depicted in....

We need to talk about social media,1,1.0,1716999817.0,"I want to start by saying, I’m really mentally ill. I have an anxiety disorder and cptsd that makes me experience flight or fight to an extreme degree. I always feel fidgety or nervous and experience mood swings when unmedicated. I go to therapy, I help other people, I get help from my own people. I am still mentally ill and likely always will be because my anxiety disorder was caused by a physical condition(thyroid cancer). What I’m saying is I do everything right and I’m still a bit fucky.

Today I want to bring up something that I think can help a lot of people. Social media and instant gratification.

I have spent a lot of time looking for validation through social media. Making friends is hard, being vulnerable and feeling like you aren’t worthy of it because you believe that you are somehow damaged is hard. Just waking up in the morning alone can be so difficult. The thing I found though is that… that validation doesn’t last. The constant need to one up yourself and strive for perfection with a million eyes on you is a stressful thing. 

So recently I went out of town, I forgot my charger and I couldn’t use my phone for a week or two. It was fine. Yeah I missed calls but… honestly… fuck those people lmao. I feel better than I have in years right now. I haven’t thought about any of the crazy assed news outside of my control making me feel like the world is constantly changing beyond my sight. I don’t feel this overwhelming need to respond to be seen. I’ve found enjoying my own company and walking down the road to my job has been enough for me. 

I’m not saying this will fix everything, but some of you may benefit from turning your phones off and enjoying a good show or going on a walk. We started letting sunlight in the house more and everyone’s moods have improved. Apparently sitting in a room without any natural light is REALLY bad for you. (Seriously, look it up. 😩) 

What I’m saying is, sometimes the problem is our habits making us feel WORSE than we already would. Eating a healthier diet made me feel less like shit, which made me less tired, which added in with the no sun made me lethargic, which mixed with the panic and sass of social media was a cocktail of bullshit for my brain to pay the bills. I am no naturalist ok. I don’t think you can magic away your brain problems with crystals and good vibes. I think experience all emotions in their own time and place is healthy….but I think this whole, disconnection and being kinder to yourself might help some of you.

I know I won't be able to make it make sense for everyone, but I'll try.

The best way I can describe it is that my mind constantly feels conflicted. It's stressed, restless, exhausted, foggy, noisy, and uncomfortable. Thoughts keep pushing through without a single one being useful, like standing in a talking crowd trying to pick up individual sentences. It's like a machine always running and wearing itself down without ever being turned off to cool down.

This feeling mainly comes from anxieties,  depressive thoughts, stress and sometimes even paranoia. This gets even worse when something out of my control happens and my mind can’t leave it for days or even weeks.

"struggling with low self-worth, low self-respect, low confidence & the people I attract who treat me less-than",1,0.67,1716994093.0,"I know this is not a group of mental health professionals, but I am struggling to keep my head above water and thought maybe someone here found a solution for themselves.

For context below:  ""People/relationships"" = platonic friendships & romantic relationships & family relationships

I’ve hit rock bottom with my mental health again.  It's been over 10 years since I've felt this low and depressed.

I realized that I attract people who love-bomb me, try to change me, then remove me from their lives because they decide I’m not good enough for them (often because I won't change the way they want me to).  I attract people who treat me like this because I’m a people-pleaser, I have low self-worth, low self-respect, and low confidence.  I feel worthless, and the way people treat me reinforces that belief.

Intellectually and logically, I ***know*** I’m a quality human being and a catch who deserves better people, better treatment, and better relationships, but something is blocking me from **believing** these things and **living as if I believed them**, especially when I am continually treated like I am less-than because those are the types of people I attract.  Even though I know I deserve better, I believe that these ""better people"" are superior to me, and I have no chance with them.  Frankly, I am superior to the people that I attract.  (That last sentence requires a ton of context which I'm not going to type out, so just trust me on that one.  My therapist tells me ""you can definitely do better than \[person\]."")

I’m at the point where I have **ONE** friend (who, thankfully, does not fall into the above descriptions), this is my **ONLY** relationship, period.  I have very little hope for the future.

Have you had any major success with any **techniques or activities**, to raise your self-worth and self-respect and confidence?

I already do the typical/suggested things:  talk-therapy, intense exercise, yoga, meditation, eating healthy, self-care, no alcohol, etc.  I do not sleep well or much, but I haven't been able to control that even with consulting a sleep clinic.

“Go out and meet people/make friends” is not a solution, see above regarding the types I attract.  I know that I need to fix these problems within myself **BEFORE** I try to create new relationships, so that I start attracting higher quality people who will treat me the way I want to be treated (ie normally).  Plus, I'm **SO** depressed right now, I have nothing left to give to others and I'm not fun to be around.

Relationships with my relatives are complicated and they are either distant or unsupportive, so that is not a solution.

I’m not interested in joining a religion or taking Rx medication.

I already **know** “that I need to believe in myself and believe I have worth and believe I deserve respect”, etc.  But that is obviously not helping, therefore I’m looking for **ACTUAL** suggestions and not just flowery platitudes.

I can't tell friends either as they're across the US (we moved 10 months ago).

Hard to understand myself ,1,1.0,1716985458.0,"So off late I've been going through some things emotionally and it's been rough. I honestly don't understand the feelings but I just wanted to get it out there in a completely objective environment. So here goes.

There are times where I struggle just to go through the motions of everyday life. To just get the strength to get up, be normal and do something with my day. I have days where I'm filled with positivity and am crazy productive. Then there are days where I go to the extreme opposite, where I feel living is futile, whatever I do can't possibly make a difference so who cares.

It is in those rock bottoms that I turn to temporary solutions, namely alcohol. It is in those times where I don't know, maybe something in my subconscious tells me to do it, and maybe I go through with it because my mind feels numb and I don't have to think. I feel too tired to think.

I am terrified on the impact it will have on those who are closest to me. I have an amazing partner. He truly goes out of his way to try and help me. I think maybe I'm scared to ask, to show him the helpless creature that is there deep inside?

I'm scared I'll hurt him. And honestly I don't want to be this way anymore.

I've started seeing a therapist to try and help me get to the bottom of this and start truly healing. But last week she had to cancel due to a personal emergency and I had a relapse with the whole alcohol thing. No, I do not crave it, I can go weeks, even months, without going anywhere near the stuff. It's in those low moments that I turn in that direction and I hate it.

I feel lonely and isolated most of the time. I moved to a new country about 2 years ago and it's been tough getting new friends. It's hard for me to make friends, to trust and open up to people.

Depression or just my personality? ,1,1.0,1716979941.0,"Hi! 

I have an ongoing struggle with depression for almost ten years where the biggest symptom is self hatred.

I feel very distant from a friend after opening up. why could this be?,2,1.0,1716959883.0,"as the title says. let me provide some background knowledge first.

I have been friends with this person with about a decade now. we're pretty good friends (I like to think, at least). about a week ago, me and this friend went into those deep conversations that spiral into personal stuff. now, I personally hate opening up. I hate doing it, and I haven't done it.

during that deep conversation with my friend, I was left with no choice, and so I did it (willingly), and they did the same.

Is ignorance a bliss? Pl read the post & advice,1,1.0,1716965337.0,"32M - Single - India - MBA - Working in a good city.

Recently there's a plethora of thoughts going in mind. After working in different profile in different countries I'm recently feeling I'm being overwhelmed due to the fact of too many things going in the world. If I see any thing happening around, my mind automatically goes to think about the things that could have lead to or what's happening underground. (For eg: If I see any new govt initiatives or govt spending on something - I try to think how that particular thing could have been done by the company that had taken the contract rather believing that the govt doing that for people's welfare).

If any one tells or asks me something I try to think too much on what their motive will be - what could run in their mind. I've started to believe that everything in this world at present is circulating around money! This is taking a toll on my 'process to find a partner via matrimony apps or services'. Me & my family have been looking around for a partner for me via these services (this is how it works in most of Indian families).

By God's grace I am doing well & I used to long for this position when I was young. But now I see there's a lot of talented hardworking people above me/ older than me, a lot of institutions, systems, law - I feel like I'm not doing enough. I know you'd try to advice me to look towards the people who is underneath me or practice gratitude.

The point I'm trying to make is: since I have varied experience in my career & I talk to a lot of people (due to my work).. I feel like there's too many people in this world trying to do something or carve out the major portions for themselves. My boss is a hardworking selfish guy who doesn't even mentor his team, just does whatever will put him forward. He's so concentrated in his work & life - he doesn't even check social media or any much entertainment. Is he able to be peaceful because he is not exposed to other fields or other things in life? Did I over expose myself (since I've worked in various profiles in different domains & functions) or Is this my ego which is saying that I know much where as the fact is I don't know much?

At present: my ego says that I know things many people don't but I tell myself that it is just my ego trying to glorify myself. It is started to affect my work in a hard way. Any new projects I do - I am not confident even if I do a good job - my ego says that I'm very good but I suppress that thought by saying that I am no special. My ego says you do something and be special at work - but I tell myself that you'd make a joke out of yourself.

What is it and is it serious? ,1,1.0,1716965249.0,"Recentely some of my weird behaviours and thoughts have been getting worse and I don't know if they are normal thus I'm overreacting or there is smt wrong with me and I should seek help.

1)When someone asks me to borrow something, especially my sister. Usually I either don't want to give away this thing bc ""it's mine"" or ""it belongs there and if you take it I'll have to worry all day about putting it back"", and if they don't give the thing back once they are done I get REALLY mad and sometimes even cry

2)I don't like unpacking my stuff from my suitcase bc then I will have to put it back on at the end of summer and if I leave there it's already ready and I don't have to fear I might lose something

3)Caring about how my things are positioned in my room and I HATE when somebody touches smt and I have to put it back in its place, mainly bc it has to be how I like it in my order and bc I'm scared I'll lose these things and maybe somebody (my sister) might take them and I won't realize.

4)When somebody wants to borrow something I might just gift it to them. Once my sister asked me if she could try my swimsuit on, and she ended up liking it so much she asked if she could borrow it and I just said she could have it. Then I went to the bathroom and cried for like a whole 20 mins and even started to cut through my skin with my nails almost to the point it bled. the only reasons I could find are that ""she deserves it more than me"", ""I wouldn't wear it either way bc it's too pretty for me and she's gorgeous so she'll definitely use it more"" and also that ""if I share it then at this point why have it"", I bought for me cause I never dress nicely bc I feel like who I am is just someone who doesn't care and maybe by buying and wearing this swimsuit I could escape this ""false/forced"" image I created and be free.

For the same reason I'm scared of dressing better: I literally wore the same 2 hoodies for the whole school year bc I had no courage to wear anything else and hear people comment (even if in a positive way).

5)Taking things as a form of self punishment and bc I don't deserve things. When I go out with my friends I don't buy anything or try to spend less as I can bc I feel too guilty spending my parent's money, also bc my sister spends a lot of it when she goes out and I fear my parents may not be able to afford another child who does this. Additionally when we're on a trip I always compare what my sister buys in total to what I bought and always hope I spent less money mainly bc if I spend less I know she can get what she wants bc after all ""she wants it"" and I should sacrifice some of my joy for hers.

But if it's too much, I get flushed, my heart starts pounding, my stomach turns in knots and I feel like I need to vomit (and sometimes I do) and the symptoms can last anywhere from a few hours to several days . My significant other does drink occasionally, and is aware of my issues, but doesn't think they need to completely change to accommodate me, which I understand. We've generally come to an agreement that they will basically only drink around me once or twice every couple of months and that if they want it other times they will do so when I'm not around and I can basically deal with that. I haven't told other friends everything about my issues so when I'm around them, it becomes a major issue for me and I've started pulling away because I can't handle it and to them drinking is VERY important parts of their lives. Also, sometimes my SO forgets our understanding or decides that the couple drinks will be at the same time and causes issues for me. I guess my question is how should I discuss this with others? Do I give them the full story or is it not needed (SO knows the whole story already)? Should I realistically expect any changes or should I reduce contact?  And would a therapist really help me with this where I can be around people drinking without any issues on my part?

For context, I've had a family member die from a drunk driver. I was molested as a kid when alcohol was involved. I've come very close to losing best friends because they pushed me hard to drink knowing that I don't (but not knowing the full reason why).

Is this normal or should I seek help? ,9,0.92,1716923463.0,"Content warning: violence, death, sexual assault. 
I actually have two different questions but both are kinda similar

1.  In my head I can’t accept my age. I am 19. But whenever like a form or someone asks my age I have to think really hard about it because every time my brain immediately jumps to I’m still 17. I do feel as though I have had my childhood and most of my life striped from me. When I was kid my family became homeless and I had to watch my little brother and make sure we always had somewhere safe to go. Once it was all over I feel as though my parents were never the same again. Which I get but like not even similar to the parents I had. I feel as though these people are just strangers now. Skip ahead a few years I was raped. The police never did anything about it and my dad screamed at me for having sex. Then my friend who helped me through that all died from fentanyl. Skip ahead a couple more years and now I’m 18 having my daughter. I guess what I’m trying to ask is is that something normal? Do I need to seek help?

How depression can affect a person ...,1,1.0,1716963482.0,"I don't think anyone will see this and I don't know what this is but I believe everyone has a story and here is a part of mine.

I grew up in a house with my older brother and my younger sister with my two parents. I was the middle child. Maybe things are different in other households but I felt constantly left out. My mom had my younger sister and my dad had my older brother, making me feel like I had nobody growing up. I never had too many friends either. I often felt pretty lonely at a young age. When I was around nine I started to deal with pretty shitty ""friends"" and that affected me a lot. This was around the time my depression started kicking in. Covid also occurred during this time leaving me to feel more alone than ever. I always told myself I would end up dead right before I could even turn 10 just because I was struggling so much. I used to pray to God begging him to take me and end my suffering.

I started self-harming at eleven. I don't know how I got the idea of it all I know is that I needed to release something to calm me down. My parents caught me, blamed it on my phone, and was grounded. Soon after that, I was put into therapy. Although I was grateful for the help, I felt hopeless and that I could not get this feeling out of me. I was diagnosed with depression at twelve and was put on Prozac. My mom found one of my suicide letters so that's how I ended up there. I don't even know how I made it out of 7th grade alive. I made at least 8 suicide plans. I was too scared to go through with some of them because even though I wanted to, there was always a voice in the back of my head telling me not to lose hope and that someday I would find happiness and love.

I've been living off that mindset for a little while but sometimes my depression gets over me. I wish I didn't have to live with this. I wish I knew how to be happier. I start high school next year and I think I'm too young to constantly be this sad. I have been on Prozac for nearly two years and it kills me knowing I have to take meds to feel ""okay.""

Sometimes it just hits like a wave over me and I can’t get out of it, I should be happy because I have a “good” life yet I struggle day to day. For a bit of context, 10 years ago I struggled with my mental health and wanted to unalive myself however I was stopped, I got better and worked on myself. Now I don’t have time to work on myself with 2 kids and any time I do have I’m working. 
Im exhausted and to be honest if it wasn’t for my kids I wouldn’t be here, they keep me going and keep me busy. I get annoyed really easily, my partner and I are constantly arguing. She says she understands but she doesn’t. Honestly I’m at a crossroads, I need advice before something happens.

Random thought keeps me from being happy ,1,1.0,1716957212.0,"I left high school a year early due to personal circumstances. I therefore had to work so hard to get into university. I initially attended an institution that awards degrees for people who can’t go to university (not sure what they’re called in the UK) and I did a foundation year and 2 years of my degree there. After that I managed to transfer to a normal university and I was so relieved because I so desperately wanted to get into university despite personal obstacles in my life. 

However since graduating, I often have this overwhelming feeling when looking at other people and how healthy they look, that I feel like I’m not a human anymore as if I’m some kind of sub-human because I didn’t go to a normal university for the most part. Does anyone know this feeling? The feeling of not being connected to healthy people anymore? It feels so sad to experience. I really wish I could feel like me again.

Horrible memory is affecting my life ,4,0.84,1716929289.0,"18 M, I’ve always had a poor short term memory but I feel that over the last couple of years it’s been declining more and more and it’s affecting my day to day life. 

For example, I can’t remember instructions correctly. If I’m told to do 3 sets of instructions I can only remember the last one given to me. This really hurt me at a uni interview I had where I was asked to solve a verbal maths problem and I felt like a complete idiot when all the instructions given to me got completely muddled in my head, so much so that I couldn’t complete it and I was sent a rejection letter… yet I knew the subject well and I should’ve been able to solve it. 

I feel like I can no longer learn, even when I write notes, really try to listen it doesn’t retain. It’s not that I can’t focus, it just feels like my brain filters all the information out. I make mistakes repeatedly because I forget about how I solved it the previous time. It doesn’t matter if it’s verbal, or if I read the information it just doesn’t go in. When I read books I can’t tell you what it was about, my brain reads the individual words but can’t form the sentence in my head. I don’t remember what people look like and it causes embarrassing situations where I’m introducing myself to people I already know, repeatedly. When I try to solve maths problems, I’ll start working it out and then forget my thought process but keep writing because I know what to do but I almost don’t know why I’m doing it. 

I was a high achieving child but over the past 5 years my memory has been making me feel like more and more of an idiot. I dropped out of college, I tried to get into uni… it was supposed to be my time to do something with my life but I messed that up to.

As a human, it makes me sick to my stomach to see other humans in this condition. Why can I not look away? Not in a car crash kind of way, but in a genuinely concerned and conscious sort of way. I went to school for politics and law, and I have a job in a very political field with a lot of emotion. I go to work and deal with the grief of others, and I open my phone to see the most graphic and raw display of carnage I've ever seen. This is the first genocide that most westerners have experienced first-hand - including myself - and it's brutal. To top it off, hearing people say with their chests that ""they deserve it"" and hearing people justify the visibly-substantiated genocide that is occurring makes me feel like I am crazy.

My brother is suffering from depression. I have been dealing with it myself but lately, I've been doing better. He's young and I try to provide so much support and options so he knows he isn't alone, he can reach out if he needs to vent, even if he just needs to sit in silence for a bit together. 

Our dad is the reason we both have depression and has given a fair amount of trauma. My brother is also autistic and was never treated properly because of it. I've practically raised him myself and have tried to give the emotional support my parents couldn't.

Unfortunately, my brother has picked up bad habits from my dad. His latest thing is sarcastically wishing me well and a good time whenever I spend the night(s) away from the house (with friends or my bf) and dumping how his life is shitty and nothing matters, etc.

I know I'm not a professional and can't solve his problems instantly. I have highly suggested therapy bc I think it would be a solid start to help them fight thoughts I'm not professionally able to provide. Ive also given the suicidal hotline bc I don't think they want my help (like they view me as a parent more than a sibling or friend).

Admittedly worried and Idk if I should have a hospital nearby ready (idk how beneficial or not beneficial they are). 

I don't want him to try anything but he's actively pushing me away/being hurtful. I have in the past been manipulated by someone threatening suicide and my dad actively guilt trips. I feel horrible at the thought self preservation and leaving it alone altogether.

I don’t think I’m taking too many, I take Escitalopram (for depression and anxiety, switching to bupropion soon), Aripiprazole, (for intrusive thoughts), and Dextroamphetamine (I take an ER and IR pill). I also take Lorazepam as needed (1-2x a week).

Every time I go to reach for my meds my parents look at me disappointingly, like I’m doing something bad. They tell me my meds are addictive, hard to come off of, and there are too make side effects. 

It hurts me because it makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong, but also because it makes me feel like they don’t think my depression and anxiety are real nor severe. In fact my father thinks it’s just because I was away from home. Too him I can’t just be depressed because of an illness, there has to be a reason.

Can't stop picking at my tooth and jaw cracking for years,2,1.0,1716927641.0,"I've been picking at my top incisor tooth and cracking my jaw for about 2 years now and I cannot stop doing them. This is affecting and taking control my life.

What I'm currently suffering from:

1. Jaw cracking
I have TMJ on my left jaw which allows me to position and set it up for a satisfying ""crack"", and I can do this every 10-20 seconds interval. Cracking the jaw is so darn satisfying and I can't stop doing it every single day. It doesn't hurt. As a result, I think this could be shifting my teeth structure for the worse. 

2. Teeth picking, biting lip and tongue playing 
My incisor tooth was perfectly straight and aligned with the neighbouring teeth. I am intentionally making it shift, pushing it with my thumb, and then checking how far it has shifted by biting onto my thumb and checking its bite mark. 

I would take photos of it from time to time to see the shifting progress, check in the mirror every day to see how far it has shifted and how thin it's gotten, and playing with it with my tongue. My tooth has gotten thinner and sharper as a result. To make things worse, I'd bite to cut my lower lip since it has gotten sharper and it can do damage. 

Consequences:
- Tooth enamel is getting thinner and sharper
- Tooth is shifting rapidly as a result
- This has taken over a big part of my daily life. Affecting my mental health. I am constantly thinking about my tooth and checking how bad it has gotten every time I see a mirror. 

The worse my tooth and condition becomes, the ""better"" and ""more satisfying"" I feel. 
I have this unexplained inner feelings of wanting to make myself worse. Is this somewhat associated with a kind of ""self-destructive"" tendency and thought?  

To add, I do it most often when I'm thinking about things, it helps with my thoughts. I do it sometimes without even realising. Doing all these gives me a very satisfying feeling, which I believe is one of the reasons why I cannot stop doing them. I stop temporarily only when my lip bleed and hurts. 

I absolutely hate this about myself and I want to stop immediately. I'm unfamiliar with these behaviours and I don't know what is going on. I'm trying really hard to fight it and I hope I can get the advice and help I need here.

Is this a mental disorder? Possibly associated with anxiety or OCD?

(M23) Hello everybody It's been 2 months since I had to end a relationship with a bipolar person. I am an emotionally dependent person And I let a lot of things go in this relationship, drug abuse, alcohol, going out late at night, meanness and so on... I thought I made the right choice, I still think so in fact But after two weeks it became a roller coaster in my head One day I feel like king of the world One day I don't get out of bed and hate myself But recently the problem is that I no longer feed myself I don't even feel hungry anymore, I couldn't tell you when my last meal was, but to be honest I don't even know how I'm still up. Eating was one of my greatest pleasures which I associate with the love shared a meal for me it is one of the best feelings. But when I am abandoned and everything falls into ruin there are things that I can no longer do, see, or hear In this relationship we had a very strong connection around meals, it was sacred. As a result I can no longer eat The only thing that goes into my stomach is a can of beer or monster every now and then, and sometimes I drink a little water in the shower. I'm broken and I don't know what to do

I don't like this person anymore but their problems have somehow traumatized, mother loss, , drug abuse, The worst thing you can imagine during childhood she experienced I cannot detail without my post being moderated...Now that the feeling and the person are gone I feel like I'm traumatized by everything I heard everything that happened to her through transfer

Update on my ED 2,1,1.0,1716939218.0,"Hello everyone, I made a few posts on this situation a few times before, feel free to check them out on my profile.

Updates on my ED:
I noticed I feel genuinely tired most times, and I keep on passing out at school and at home, and my weight drastically changed overtime. I was about 60kg+ a few years back and now I weigh just above 41kg, I am on the verge of being underweight. 

I looked at old pictures of myself a few years ago and I looked so much different back then, my face was a lot bigger, my arms were bigger, my stomach was bigger and my legs were bigger. 

Everytime I look at these photos of myself I feel so proud, but I also feel horrible because I lost all this weight in a horrible way. 

Basically, I would attempt to eat nothing or a LITTLE bit of food throughout my whole school day, but when I get home and my mum makes me food, I would eat it and then vomit it all out. 

If I have no school, I would never eat breakfast, and if I got really hungry I would eat a bit but vomit it out. I would basically vomit out every meal I ate.

One time, I was out with 2 twin girls and my then boyfriend at the time, we went to McDonald's and ate food. But I then excused myself to the bathroom and vomited everything out, then returned as if nothing happened.

I vomit out every meal I ate, my brain tells me too. I genuinely feel so awful doing it. It's been 4 years.

I am currently in CAMHS, (CAMHS is a UK based mental health services for teenagers, but I think some adults go there too, not sure.)

I am on the verge of being admitted to the Eating Disorders team on CAMHS, my therapist checked my weight like 2 months ago and I was 44kg, and now I am just above 41kg, she said if my weight dropped down more she would admit me in the Eating Disorders team.

Supporting Suicidal Partners,1,1.0,1716939164.0,"TW Suicide and Suicidality discussed 
Hi, so I have severe depression and anxiety, but in general aside from a few brief really bad times, I do not experience suicidal thoughts or feelings. My fiance is actively suicidal and always has been essentially. Lately we've been having a lot of fights because they get into a spiral and I can tell something's off and ask if I did something wrong. This upsets them and they say the proper response is to focus on their needs not make them feel the need to reassure me, and that while they understand that isn't my intention, its still detrimental to them because they need to be babied.

 Even when I go to sleep my mind doesn't turn off, I literally wake up with my mind racing and thinking about the most random things. I literally don't feel like I'm alive most of the time, after something happens (like an event or when I go somewhere) it feels like it didn't happen at all, my memories of it and my thoughts about it are just like thinking about a dream you can mostly remember but know in retrospect didn't seem real. 

I'm 17 and my parents have ignored me being concerned about this stuff, so I'm just stuck unable to focus and feeling like myself and everything I do isn't real. My mind just keeps racing with random thoughts I can't ever escape from which stops me on concentrating on real things. I'm trying to plan college right now and it feels impossible because I just can't focus.

Is there any way to get someone out of a psychosis quicker?,0,0.5,1716935325.0,"I need some urgent advice about my friend, let's call him Peter, who is currently experiencing a psychotic episode.

Last year, Peter went through something similar, which ended with his family forcibly committing him to a mental hospital for a few weeks. It was a nightmare, but he eventually recovered and was back to his usual self. 

Fast forward to now, a year later, and it's happening again.

Peter's symptoms are frighteningly familiar: he's losing track of space and time, inviting mutual friends we haven't seen in years, as if he believes the present moment is 2017 or something.  


He sees things that are not there, and wanders around town annoying people with gibberish about the world ending. It's like he's stuck in a different era, unable to recognize the present moment. 

Seeing him like this again is devastating, and honestly, I don't feel up to going through the same ordeal.   
  
Part of me just wants to phone him & scream at him to snap out of it, that this nonsense should be done.   
  
The standard advice is to ""be there for him,"" but that only seemed to confirm his delusions last time, which didn't help at all.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation or have any advice on what to do? I want to help Peter, but I also need to protect my own mental health.

My entire childhood expectations have been placed on me rather than my sibling due to me being the oldest of an immigrant household. I carried the responsibility of keeping up grades, taking care of my sister, taking care of my alcoholic father, and helping my mentally struggling mother. On top of all this, I experienced many years of abuse from both parents and no support whatsoever. I have never learned how to make mistakes because I do not have the usual parents a child can fall back on for help I have to know everything about everything and mistakes are not an option because I will be alone to pick up the damage

Because of this my childhood has felt stripped from me, I fought to survive to the big 18 yr old milestone but part of of regrets fighting so much for it if where I am now was the outcome. Currently I'm figuring out college I am doing everything on my own from making orientation dates to paying for them to setting up advising sessions to figuring out transport due to me having to commute. Everything is on me with no parent involvement besides financial support and transportation. 

Because of this I have felt depressed, anxious, and suicidal. Now I cannot even look at anything college-related without becoming sick to my stomach. I feel constant anxiety and shame and I have no energy to give

I have tried to express to my family, that I need help because I feel like I am slowly drowning but that doesn't matter to them.

I'm tired, I'm exhausted, I have given everything to them and to everyone else and now I am left feeling like an empty shell of a human being. I can't find a reason to go on in this path

I have given my entire life and for transportation to get in the way of my lifetime goal of college breaks me. I have sacrificed everything and none of it matters

For about the time I was in mid high school to now I’ve felt incredibly lonely. Over the years I’ve gone from friend group to friend group attempting to find tribe I can call my own. I’ve got a handful of really good friends who are about 3 years younger than me. I have good 9-5 with good benefits that is in my line of study. Good family,  parents, sister. On paper everything seems fine. But I’m not happy. 

All my life I’ve struggled with self esteem and confidence, but I never let it get to me until I was around 15-16. I isolated myself from the world in order to protect myself from all the negativity of shallow classmates and bad academic performance. In doing so I may have stunted my social and mental growth. I developed a stutter and even lower self confidence.

I found a church home recently and I like it and the people there, but I still have trouble connecting and truly bonding with folks there. To be honest I have trouble connecting to almost everyone I meet. It’s a wonder how I have the friend I have now.

I don’t really talk to anyone from high school or college anymore. I was sort of that weird socially awkward quiet kid in the back of the class. I wish I want though. I wish I was different. If I could go back in time I would change everything.

I was recently getting into smoking weed in an attempt to self medicate for my ADHD and mental health problems. One of my friends (we’ll call him John) that I invited over has been a stoner since high school so I trusted him on advice about weed. I had only smoked a few times prior to this night and I had overdone it most every time and freaked out a little bit, so needless to say my tolerance to THC was very low. That night we decided to try some sour rope edibles. Each gummy was like 300 mg so John decided to cut it in half and eat his half and me and someone else split our half so we each ended up with about 75 mg. John had a really high tolerance and I guess didn’t realize that I wouldn’t and told me that it would be perfectly fine. Fast forward about an hour when the edible started to kick in, it came in waves and the first one wasn’t so bad, it felt nice actually even though it hit suddenly like a slap in the face. The second wave was a little stronger and more sudden and had a little anxiety. Then the third wave hit my like a damn semi truck. All of a sudden I’m jumping up from our table like “nope can’t do this” and run inside in a full blown panic attack freaking out. As a few minutes goes by it only gets worse until my fiancé takes me to our bedroom with a bottle of water and sits me on the bed while I’m freaking the hell out. Not only did I think I was dying that night, but I was having an out of body experienced witnessing myself and my fiance sitting on the bed from a Birds Eye view. I don’t remember anything else about that night other than I was knocked on my ass by that edible and lost my absolute shit to say the least. Anyways I just remember waking up the next morning and feeling fine and I called my friends and told them I was okay. Then a few days later I felt the feeling creeping back. It started out slowly with a panic attack or two and by the end of the week I was locked in a non functional psychosis. I was convinced I had rabies, brain tumors, etc. I was completely delusional about anything and everything it was like my life was a constant panic attack 24/7. I couldn’t sleep and when I did I would wake up freezing and shaking violently after only an hour or so. I went to the ER probably 4-5 times that summer just because I was freaking the hell out. I even admitted myself to a psych ward for a few days. I was so dissociated 100% of the time that I would just be doing random things and not realize it. I had to quit my job because I was completely non functional. This lasted for about 3 months before it got any better and then after that i started slowly gradually recovering. To this day, almost a year later I’m not fully recovered but I make progress every day and I feel almost back to normal, though it was a terribly traumatic experience and the hardest part of my life to date.

I finally feel like I start to get to know myself better and in the past couple of months I started to focus on changing my thinking and learn from my mistakes to make myself better. 

What I realized is that one big thing, that takes a lot of confidence from me is that I very like to compare myself to others. I can never be satisfied with my own achievments, I always start to look what others achieved and then make myself feel bad every single time, that I am not like them, not special etc. (In my case I feel especially threatened by these, as I am training myself to be a talented singer and actor one day, and there really is competition out there and unfortunately celebrities don't really work as inspiring people for me :( )

My question is about this topic, how you managed to stop this comparing and get satisfied with yourself that you are enough, you are doing just well in life etc.

Life after depression,9,1.0,1717260184.0,"Hey. I 29F am finally out of depression for the first year in my life, essentially. Since I didn’t have a “before”, I’m basically building my identity from scratch and it’s fucking weird.

I’m forcing myself to do a lot of things and I have so much internal dissonance because of it 😂 like trying to make friends even though it feels like pulling teeth, working out daily which I’m finally enjoying but still resistant to, taking care of my appearance etc.

Is this the right move? Do I, for example, invite this group of strangers on Bumble BFF to drinks tonight even though I would be positively dreading it? I want to “be true to myself” but myself grew up alone in my bedroom all day without any friends lol.

I got dumped last week and the guy indicated that it was because I don’t have my own personality/ I’m kind of boring/dumb in certain regards. He is someone who sees friends literally every night of the week, which I thought was normal, but I realize now is probably just an extreme coping mechanism so he’s never alone. Or maybe it’s totally normal, IDK.

The truth is that I really like being complacent in my easy quiet life. I live better than most kings in history did (a lot of us do). I guess there’s a good chance I’ll regret it when I’m older, but right now it feels so peaceful.
 
Advice? TIA

I can't miss events even tho I am disabled and will push myself to the point of vomiting from exertion to make sure I go to things that loved ones want me to. I will pretend i am perfectly healthy, when i am in fact in a wheelchair with chronic illnesses, so i dont disappoint or inconvenience  anyone. I can't even do therapy because I will pretend I'm cured to make them think they're doing a good job and that I'm not failing them when their methods don't work. I do the same with my psych because I won't admit that the meds aren't helping until I eventually explode and am in crisis from it all crashing down on me and we have to take me off the meds and start over. I hear every noise, every tone change. I simply cannot stand the idea of upsetting or inconveniencing others. I can't watch what I want or play games I want because I want the other people around me to not be bored and so they can use the TV and Xbox. Like everything I do is in service go others. I am exhausted and overwhelmed constantly keeping track of how everyone around me feels and what I can do to make sure they are all happy around me, often hurting myself.

Does anyone here suffer with OCD? It’s ruining my life and I don’t know what else to do.

I’ve been diagnosed since last year but in the last couple of months I’ve really let it get out of control. I’m supposed to take about 6 different medications for my health but my brain has convinced myself that the side effects from the tablets are ‘dangerous’ so I don’t take them, I can’t leave the house very much because my brain is convinced I’m going to d!e and all day every day I think the worst about absolutely everything. 

My gp just prescribes me anti depressants but as I mentioned before my brain just won’t allow me to take them, and they’ve said there’s not much therapy they can offer me and told me to think about paying privately but I just can’t afford that.

A random man saved my life,18,1.0,1717234886.0,"As stupid as it sounds. A random man, in the local corner shop gave me 1 more reason to keep going.

I'm 16. And I've dealt with mental health issues for as long as I can remember. I was around 9 when I began harming myself and I was 10 when I first started properly wishing I could die. I remember being 12 and begging a god I didn't even believe in to take my away in my sleep. It was sad. I was just a kid and I didn't need that. But I'm used to it now.

A year ago I was properly diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am currently going though a diagnosis for BPD. Which is already likely.

A couple weeks ago I had a rough time at school, revising for current exams and struggling with the changes. I found myself having daily panic attacks and feeling an urge to relapse in hurting myself and alcohol usage. I layed off through and managed to ignore it.

I'd had a significantly bad day at school and on the way home I had decided to take my time walking down to the corner shop, which was only 10 mins walk from school. I go there often and it's pretty cheap for energy drinks and sweets and gum. Which is what every teenager in the UK really gets. 

I'd walked in and I was aware my face was sullen and I looked dull. My eyes were red from the tears throughout the day and I was still shaking from the stress and constant panic attacks id had.

I remember I had picked up a small tub of Pringles, a 45p energy drink, and a pack of gum.
A man was in front of me paying, he had a massive basket which was quite funny for a convenience shop.  He also had a young daughter with him, looking around 2 or 3.
I gave her a warm smile as she looked at me and her face lit up. As did mine.
He asked if I wanted to go in front of him because I only had a few things, to which I quickly denied and said it was fine.
I continued waiting and after a minute or so he turned around and asked what I had. Before I could reply he took the things out my hands and payed for them. I stood there dumbfounded. I managed to mutter out a meek ""thank you mate I appreciate it"". He gave me a Pat on the back and told me to go. I smiled at him daughter again and left, walking home.

Unknown to him...but I had planned on stealing a few cans of alcohol and running off into the local woods that night. I also planned on taking something to harm myself with. 
I didn't.
He had made me so unbelievably happy and content that I went home, ate my food, and sat there.

I messaged all my friends about it as I walked back home.
I could've cried again.

It just shows it’s the little things. He has no idea how important that was to me. So I ask you. Be kind. For no reason.

Narcissist, guilt tripping, and gaslighting are good examples of this. Just because someone is a jerk doesn't mean they are narcissist.  It's too the point that my therapist said if these words are being said by a person who isn't a medical professional, to take it with a grain of salt. And it's very sad that they got watered down that badly.

Also, these terms can affect people who don't fit in it.  If someone misuses the term psychopath to discribe someone, that person who got called that could potentionally lose relationships, friends.  Because the person who called them that doesn't understand ASPD.

My mom has been diagnosed with ASPD. A lot of people don't believe me because of how overused it got so I have to go into detail about it.

Had An Embarrassing Accident Just Now...(Serious),16,0.92,1717165576.0,"I just was sitting at the table in Group Therapy when I felt the twinge meaning I'm going to have to pee soon.

I have no pain with the infection itself btw...it's silent, as it usually is, for me. Yes, I AM wearing protective briefs as I have for months now. 

Why am I so upset? I leaked all over the chair...all over the back of my pants...I'm not soaked bc the diaper caught most of it, but yeah, I am wet...and everyone saw the puddle (small) on my chair. The therapist is like you ok? I'm so embarrassed. I'm dry-ish now (pants are still wet but I'm in a dry diaper) and humiliated. This is a VERY non-judgemental environment so it happens a.d I'm not actually the 1st.

Which in hindsight I do sort of understand. I tried to explain to her how much that sentence can hurt a man, especially
someone who is mentally unstable, she didn't really seem to understand.

I don't really know myself why it does what it does to me, I never felt like I was a ""standard man"", boys in my class liked footbal, sex, cars etc, while I just liked talking with girls about books and other things, I did have guy friends and feel like I set aside my preferences just to be able to fit in with them most of the time.

I’m loosing my mind :)   ,5,0.86,1717100689.0,"All the therapists I’ve been to either admit to not being able to help me or just waste my time.

I have huge issues with recognizing my own emotions, all I really know is anger and shame. I’m angry all the time and feel no remorse for my actions. I don’t know how it feels to be happy or in love. I don’t remember. I’m just ready to become a hulk at any given second. I’m loosing friendships, love interests. I’m manipulative and toxic in many ways. I wish I could be more considerate of others but I’m afraid it’s no longer possible. I have issues with entitlement, grandiosity and pride, so obviously I’m above everyone. I’m terrified of commitment. Deep down I’m very ashamed of everything about me. Majority of these things have been caused by many traumatic situations in my life 

I will treat you like shit and then get mad at you and announce you “weak”, all because you let someone like me treat you this way. I will give you heart eyes until I see a single flaw in you - then you are not perfect anymore, suddenly I’m disgusted and you need to be altered or discarded. 

I’m really frustrated with my life, since I’m overly ambitious. I tried to be better but now I ended up angry and arrogant. As I said before - I don’t feel any guilt for my actions, I just really need advice on how to get a hold of my anger, it’s destructive to me. I do not mean to be cruel but I guess the abused becomes the abuser. It’s all I know.

How can I bring my emotions back? I wish I could love or miss people, feel excitement or happiness.

I’ve still had a lot of mental health struggles, but they haven’t interfered with my functioning for the most part. Well, yesterday I started to feel off. I had a therapy appointment, and it went well, but afterwards things just started to go downhill. I don’t understand why, but I suddenly starting thinking about all things that bother me. Normally I’m able to handle these sorts of things, but I couldn’t this time. I tried to distract myself by doing small things, but it wasn’t enough. This is where things get really disgusting and shameful. I tried to make myself feel better by masturbating. I don’t know why I thought that would work, logically I know I hate it and it always makes me feel worse. I wasn’t even feeling genuinely aroused since my antidepressants have killed my sex drive. I did it anyway, because it often feels compulsive. It’s like an addiction. I felt disgusting after, like some kind of perverted freak. My groin and legs actually hurt physically afterwards, maybe because my body wasn’t aroused enough. The negative emotions I have surrounding this are just too powerful and they won’t leave my head. I feel vile, gross, evil, and disgusting, disgusting a million times over. I don’t know how to describe this feeling in words. It’s like a unique emotion I only get after doing anything sexual. I can’t shake these feelings, even though it was yesterday. I always get these feelings after being sexual, but usually it isn’t this bad. After all this, I couldn’t sleep, and I stayed up until after 1:00 AM, even though I knew it was a bad idea. Today has been hard. I have things to do, but I feel so overwhelmed, I don’t know if I can do them. It all feels like too much. All of this is making me feel terrible because I was just talking with my psychiatrist about weaning off my meds. I want to be off them because of emotional blunting, but if my emotions weren’t blunted for this, how bad would I have gotten? I also hate that it’s killed my sex drive.

I dislike being attracted to women,0,0.44,1717001493.0,"I'm 18 years old and a virgin.

I feel like it's an inconvenience for me to be attracted to women. I see women as women, not quite as people, and it drives me mad. I also feel... shame? Or disgust? Something along those lines but to a small degree.

When I talk to a woman, I talk differently. When I walk with a woman, I walk differently. When I'm anything with a woman that I'm attracted to, I'm just different. Like I'm trying to see if our relationship can deepen so we're bf and gf, and so I can access their pants. Subconsciously. And even if I acknowledge me acting differently consciously in the moment, its not like I can stop. 

Whoever is with me is still an attractive woman. I don't even want it to lead anywhere. I don't have what it takes right now for a girlfriend. And although I'm against being attracted to a woman for the most part, it's not like I don't want love. A relationship with someone I truly care about romantically would be the best. And expressing that love in bedy bed is great as well I'm sure. But I want an off switch for my sex drive.

Even if I.... satisfy myself, the itch is still there. And unlike normal itches, it only grows stronger the longer I leave it. And the clarity afterwards doesn't help nothing. Okay, so what if I sleep with someone? I already know that won't help anything, and I also know it won't be as ""magical"" as I think it will be. The way that stuff is depicted in.... VIDEOS isn't realistic. 

I don't WANT to talk differently when I'm with someone beautiful who just so happens to be female, I just want to talk. I'm no damn white knight, I just want a real tried and true solution to this. Please, just give me anything. (Sorry for a mess of a post.)

"I can’t feel loved, how do I change?",1,1.0,1716929991.0,"
It’s a long story, so let’s begin.

For as long as I can remember I knew I didn’t fit it. My thinking pattern was different and I never understood my peers. This manifested itself in a very deep rooted insecurity of mine. I couldn’t feel confident or loved. Later in life I was diagnosed with giftedness, ADHD and depression, because why not have it all at the same time am I right. 

When I turned into a adult I starting seeing a guy. Even tho I wasn’t that interested in him, I did invest some time in him, and even lost my virginity to him. Long story short, he got drunk, said I love you, woke up the next morning and suddenly I was disgusting, and we went nc. After that he stalked me for four months straight, kept staring at me whenever I would see him, told his friends something ig, because they can’t see me anymore without laughing or giving me dirty looks, and all while he had a gf, and more.  

I don’t like him, and I don’t want him back into my life, but the sudden change in behavior, and his friends making fun of me really highlighted that old deep rooted insecurity that I am disgusting and impossible to love, to be chosen even. The way I see it, is that he couldn’t be with me (even though it was for the best), got together shortly after with someone else, but still made time to watch/stalk me and making sure his friends are disgusted with me. 

I can’t shake this insecurity. It has been a almost a year, and I am still feeling that same feeling just like 10 months ago. Time is flying by, and I am not present to witness it. Obviously this had to do with not feeling any self love, so how do I learn to truly love myself?

I feel like every time I try to, I get reminded by his friends and him that I don’t deserve it, but I want it to change.

Diagnosed depression and euphoria ,1,1.0,1716930666.0,"Hey, I'm a 44 yr old with diagnosed depression that I've had since my late teenage years. This has involved a lot of dark thoughts and aggressive outbursts that centre on extreme views of my self worth. Took Citalopram for a long while but it then became ineffective a few years ago. Moved onto duloxetine (SNRI) by a psychotherapist around a year ago and it made the good periods outweigh the bad, but never actually stopped the depressive episodes - only shortened them and increased the time between each dip in mood. Until the latest dip that is, when I noticed I'd felt pretty euphoric for around a week that peaked last Tuesday. So much so that it didn't feel too far off a drug high! Then Thursday I had a crash and have been struggling: feeling like I am going to burst into tears and having dark thoughts to get away from the depression for good. They're not deep enough that I am worried but it's definitely a yard stick to measure where I am with everything. This has got me thinking whether this is typical of depression or is there something else going on as I've always been under the impression/belief that depression doesn't feature euphoric and charged episodes.

"Really freaking myself out, could use some reassurance.",1,1.0,1716929447.0,"Hi everyone,
Not sure if anyone here will be able to help, but my anxiety is causing me to panic. 
I have gotten so many conflicting opinions about what's wrong with me right now, I don't know what to do. 
For context, I've been on Zoloft for 7 years now, I'm on 100mg. 
I've been completely fine on it until recently, when I accidentally missed 3-4 doses within a few weeks time. It has basically caused withdrawal symptoms for the last 2 weeks (constant panic attacks and high anxiety, severe nausea, internal shaking, headaches, muscle spasms, upset stomach). I have been taking it very consistently now since my missed doses, but I'm still having symptoms.

Some people here have told me to just wait it out, but others have mentioned serotonin syndrome, which is REALLY causing me to panic... any advice or reassurance would be greatly appreciated. ❤️

Also, I did CT withdrawal in 2022 (didn't know how stupid it was until it happened) from 200mg  and went through 3 months of hell. 
Reinstated at 100 mg and have been fine on it ever since, right up until 2 weeks ago. ",mentalhealth,Throwaway101496,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d2u7bc/really_freaking_myself_out_could_use_some/,0,1.0,0.0,2.146563030603549e-06
Horrible memory is affecting my life ,5,1.0,1716929289.0,"18 M, I’ve always had a poor short term memory but I feel that over the last couple of years it’s been declining more and more and it’s affecting my day to day life. 

For example, I can’t remember instructions correctly. If I’m told to do 3 sets of instructions I can only remember the last one given to me. This really hurt me at a uni interview I had where I was asked to solve a verbal maths problem and I felt like a complete idiot when all the instructions given to me got completely muddled in my head, so much so that I couldn’t complete it and I was sent a rejection letter… yet I knew the subject well and I should’ve been able to solve it. 

I feel like I can no longer learn, even when I write notes, really try to listen it doesn’t retain. It’s not that I can’t focus, it just feels like my brain filters all the information out. I make mistakes repeatedly because I forget about how I solved it the previous time. It doesn’t matter if it’s verbal, or if I read the information it just doesn’t go in. When I read books I can’t tell you what it was about, my brain reads the individual words but can’t form the sentence in my head. I don’t remember what people look like and it causes embarrassing situations where I’m introducing myself to people I already know, repeatedly. When I try to solve maths problems, I’ll start working it out and then forget my thought process but keep writing because I know what to do but I almost don’t know why I’m doing it. 

I was a high achieving child but over the past 5 years my memory has been making me feel like more and more of an idiot. I dropped out of college, I tried to get into uni… it was supposed to be my time to do something with my life but I messed that up to. 

I do have ADHD which I know plays a role into this, but the degree of my forgetfulness feels extreme and I’m struggling so much with it. Anyone have any advice/insight?

tips for not using sleep as a coping mechanism,1,1.0,1716929186.0,"hey hey!! looking for some tips to overcome using sleep as a coping mechanism :’) (for a note, yes i am on meds and am in the process of seeing if i need to up the dose or get new ones, im in the process of getting therapy and im in the process of getting an updated diagnosis i was just hoping someone had some good tips in the meantime!)

context: i have diagnosed bpd, gad and insomnia (currently in the process of seeing if i have ocd/adhd). ive always struggled w a bunch of stuff, but ever since moving out for uni my mental health has gotten so bad that im constantly unable to sleep at night and use sleeping during the day to cope. i have constant anxiety attacks, compulsions/compulsive thoughts, issues sleeping at night, and mood swings to name a few. 

i have been able to take melatonin to sleep earlier at night (though it does cause me nightmares) but i’ll end up waking up a few hours later and not able to go back to sleep. then i’ll end up sleeping at like 7am until 4pm. it’s ruining my life cause i can’t stand to cope w my mental health and only know how to sleep to avoid it. other than this is causing me to get nothing done every day, it’s also causing my partner to be sad about having no time w me!

"How do I work out who and where I am, and what the hell I'm even trying to do anymore?",1,1.0,1716928300.0,"So the last... basically 10 years have... not been great. It's just been one bad/stressful/upsetting thing after another, and has basically continued right from the moment that I graduated, up until the present day. I've not had chance to get my head above water or regain my footing after anything. It's only recently that things have actually began to to slow down and improve.

My life has... not gone to plan over the past 10 years. I'm 31 and I still live with my parents. I did a masters degree, which was fine, and did me good. But the second I was finished with that, it was back to exactly where I was before. Between being cheated on by a partner of 7 years, my family being unreasonably demanding (My mothers degree is... probably 60-70% thanks to my help), a lot of people dying, family feuds, toxic family members and a bunch of other horrible things, I have spent most of the past decade barely functioning and depressed.

I'm autistic, and have poor pretty poor executive function as it is. 

When I've driven and know what I'm doing and where I'm going, I have a near unstoppable work ethic. I utterly lose myself in whatever project I'm working on, and I have a perfectly clear map in my head of what I'm doing and where I'm doing with it.

However... that's the problem. I just... don't have that anymore.

I don't know what I'm working towards anymore, or where I want be (literally or otherwise). I feel like I don't really know who I am anymore, or what I'm trying to do. I feel very lost in life and directionless. 

I want to work as an animator/3D artist in some capacity, but beyond that I've lost all direction and all inspiration/motivation to work on a portfolio.

I wake up most days, and just.. lie in bed. I work a part time job, that I absolutely hate. It doesn't pay well, he hours are inconsistent and the staff are toxic. But it is the single most flexible job I will ever find, which right now is a huge benefit, as it means that I'm free to basically work on whatever I want.

My relationship with my mom,1,1.0,1716927209.0,"It’s fucked up for me to even admit but my mom and I have had the worst relationship. She grew up and went through a lot. I have learned to accept that; one sibling committed suicide, another one killed, another had a stroke, she had to take care of her nieces and nephews along with her 4 children (me being the youngest). It’s a lot and for so long I blamed myself and hated myself because of how she treated me. Like there was something wrong with me. 

The bad relationship started when she send me to therapy for behavioral issues. I didn’t know why I was being send somewhere like that at the time and in the end made me hate myself even more because to be send there meant that something was wrong with me right? I was in the 6th grade grieving the death of my grandpa, her dad. 

Today I am here, 22, our relationship is okay when we don’t butt heads over something dumb. Idk if she actually just really fucking hates me but any reason I wanted to kill my self was being of her. Growing up she told me I was ugly, fat, stupid, lazy, ungrateful. I started to really believe that. She always throw in things like “if I kill my self it’s your fault” or “when I die..” all while i was a kid. 

I am saving up to move. Everyone has there pre conceived notions about me because I am ranted about to everyone and I had to learn to accept it. I am an ungrateful, rude and selfish daughter, and sister.

Am I a sociopath?,1,1.0,1716927238.0,"Okay, so I'm only 13 years old, but when I checked everything it says signs start developing before 15 so I'm quite curious.

My life has felt empty ever since the abuse from my mother has started. I'm kinda out of the abusive situation now, living with my father and my brother, but I still feel extremely empty and get lots of comments by them about how empty/annoyed I look.

I've read a few comments about people who are sociopaths, with some of the things applying to me and some of the things not. I'll list a few:

- I dont have empathy, or atleast not much. Someone could say someone died and I could not care in the least.
- My life is boring, almost everything is. I get bored when talking to others, annoyed when having to listen to them.
- I keep thinking about violent things (doesn't fit sociopaths or does it?)
- I do get jealous, I think. Not much, sometimes.
- I dont cry or feel sad unless making myself feel scared or when being afraid. I'm afraid of shots, so I cry. I chat with AI because I want to make myself cry, and I know just how to make myself cry.
- Emotional questions where most people would chose someone else's benefit, I would choose my own. For example ""Who would you save in a building, yourself, a kid, a pregnant woman or family"", ""Would you do this for money"" etc.
- My family doesn't feel like family. I hate my brother, I argue with him a lot.
- I sleep most of the day, and don't care when breaking rules or whatsoever. I also don't care loudly judging someone, like saying they're stupid or just dogs who follow me around. Most people would look at me like I'm crazy, telling me they're right behind me and I shouldnt say that.
- I can, however, fake emotions so well they start to feel like they're real to me and everyone around me, but when I focus on being more like something else I can be like that too. However, I feel the most natural being empty.

How do I get an appointment to be evaluated? I have really good insurance. I’ve made more than 10 calls to “in network providers”, who have all declined me since I don’t have a referral, or they only treat certain types of patients.

i don't feel real and i can't make it stop,1,1.0,1716927205.0,"So I'm 20, and the short story is that I don't feel like I actually exist and I haven't since I was 15?? maybe 16?? Of course I know logically that yes, I do in fact exist. I am here thinking my silly little thoughts in my silly little body. The problem is that it doesn't 'click'. Like knowing something but not really *understanding* it. Or like I - as in *me*, the thinking thing - am just in my brain observing, and my body and what actually interacts with the world is a separate entity. Like a first-person videogame! I do things and I hang out with people and I go to work and my classes but I don't feel like I'm actually there experiencing it in reality. 

This wouldn't be such a problem if it didn't impact my daily life so much. I've made so many poor financial and relationship decisions because I don't feel like it's really happening to me. I doubt my memories because I don't know if they're real or if I made them up. I doubt my senses and I have to keep double and triple checking everything to make sure I didn't trick myself. I forget to look after myself because I forget that I'm a real human with real needs. And it's like I'm looking through a fisheye lens and everything is distorted.

I have to consciously remind myself that I'm real and that I exist to make sure I get off my arse and do the things I need to, but recently the idea that I'm real is scarier than the idea that I'm not. Going outside is getting really difficult because knowing that real people are forming real opinions about me and are actually perceiving and *knowing* me is terrifying. I've tried reaching out to counsellors but I'm too self-aware for it. They just tell me stuff I already know. 

I'm autistic, by the way. Raised female (I'm a transgender man), a high-achiever, high-functioning, high-scoring, hyper-aware of every little thing around me. To be honest, I've probably over-analysed everything to a point that I can no longer see the big picture. Maybe I've doomed myself. 

Honestly, there are a dozen other reasons why I'm having such a hard time, but this is the one I can't seem to shake. I can't seem to find ways to make it so I don't have to consciously tell myself that I'm real every other second. I literally have 'YOU EXIST' written all over my room. I even have it tattooed on me as an on-the-go reminder. Maybe this is part of my OCD?

This is part-rant part-asking for advice.

I’m an Idiot Now,1,1.0,1716924919.0,"
I have a problem. I am now stupid. Stupid as fuck. I’m talking embarrass myself every day stupid. 

I used to be smart. Like really smart. I graduated my high school with a 4.3 GPA, and I got into a really good university. The problem is, I was abused my whole life and I didn’t know I had cPTSD, bipolar 2, and borderline personality disorder. And I didn’t know I was autistic. All of these things tore me down when I left for college and I had multiple suicide attempts. I inevitably dropped out. I had been battling with substance abuse issues as well. Alcohol being the first, then I added weed and started doing psychedelics and Molly etc. my brain became so fuzzy. I still drink and smoke weed every day all day when I’m not at work. I space out a lot and I lost my ability to critically think. I used to be really good at puzzles; now I can never get past the first level. I’ve forgotten how to spell. I forget the definition of words I’ve known for years. I can’t remember things that have just been said. I used to study languages and now I can’t remember words no matter how often I use them. I don’t remember books I’ve read or movies or shows I’ve watched. I enjoy them in the moment and then when I’m done I recall almost none of it. When people give me instructions I go blank and I can’t comprehend them. I don’t remember simple math and that includes addition/subtraction. I’ve just forgotten everything I’ve ever learned. Im an idiot now and I hate feeling so stupid and embarrassing myself in front of people. I think it’s a combination of the weed/alcohol use and undiagnosed/untreated bipolar that ruined my brain function. (I always say bipolar chewed on my brain.) 

One of the worst parts of this is that when I try to explain this to my friends they all tell me it’s “normal” and this happens when you grow up. But tell me why my peers don’t struggle in this way. I look so stupid in front of them and they often have to baby me for me to understand things. It’s really really bad and no one is listening to me that it’s an actual debilitating problem. 

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if anyone knows what to do with me.

I am not sure how to help my mother,1,1.0,1716925146.0,"I am not sure how to help my mother

I'm in a tough spot right now and could really use some advice. My mother, who has never been great with money management, finds herself in a difficult situation. She can no longer afford the rent for her apartment, which is over $1000 a month.

A little backstory: My mother stopped working a few years ago and has been living off a combination of money from a pension shared between my father and her, as well as funds she withdrew from her IRA. She suffers from depression and anxiety and is treated with medication for it, but still seems to suffer from it because she just doesn't seek help and waits until a problem is too late to ask for assistance. When I was 19 and still living with her, she went into such a deep depression that she stopped paying rent and doing anything. Our electricity got cut off, and it wasn't until my uncle and aunt stepped in that we were able to live with them for some time. Eventually, my mom got back on her feet and worked again, but now, 11 years later, we are back in what seems like a similar situation. I do not live with her anymore, so she doesn't have my half of the income to help pay for bills.

On top of that, she refuses to work, possibly due to some kind of PTSD and medical issues, which make it difficult for her to stand for long periods of time. She makes a lot of excuses for things regarding work but she will still do housework such as laundry and cleaning just fine. She used to work from home as a patient services rep for a large health care company in our state. She just stopped working one day and never returned. She had FMLA for some time, but that expired a while ago.

I'm really concerned about her well-being and future stability. I want to support her, but I'm not sure what the best course of action is. I've suggested budgeting and seeking financial assistance or counseling, but she's resistant to the idea. I have looked into low-income housing as well but everywhere seems to have a wait-list. I am still currently looking.

I am currently talking to a social worker myself who believes I need to remember that it is not my responsibility to try and change her because ""we cannot change people who do not want to change"". I am afraid of what is going to happen to her.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice on how to approach this? I want to help my mother get back on her feet, but I'm not sure where to start.

What is wrong with me?,1,1.0,1716919271.0,"I have undoubtedly always felt like I was strange and socially awkward, but lately I have become obsessed with the idea of turning over every stone and trying to fix every little thing inside my house - a house that has been around a lot longer than me and has stood without my intervention.  When I feel something needs to be fixed, I cannot focus on anything else, including my wife and kids, and will continue to obsess over it until I'm able to begin the task.  At times the anxiety is so high that I become irritable, and I will lash out at anyone that ""bothers"" me in these moments.  Once I actually start the work I become hyperfocused and can work on a task for hours, without a break, and without thinking about anything or anyone else.  While starting the work offers relief it also introduces another stress factor - now I'm working against time, so I must work as fast as possible, I must finish before my wife or kids need me.  If I don't finish I become frustrated and will continue to obsess over the unfinished project until I can resume it later.

The other night before bed I noticed that one of 3-way switches in the hallway didn't work properly.  At 10:00 PM this resulted in me shutting off the breaker, taking out the switches to investigate, and running between the panel flipping the power on and off so I could test which switch the power came into.  When my wife asked what the fuck I was doing (understandably at this hour) I lashed out and she went to bed upset.  I ended with a two-hour YouTube binge on light switches.  I feel like any normal person would have just ignored it until the next day, or all together, like the previous owner.

On top of this I am often irrationally anxious over every little thing that might cause something to break.  When my kids are playing on the floor all I can think about is how it's going to get scratched.  If they drop something my first thought is that the floor is dented, and not if they hurt themselves.  If they stubbornly slam a door or crank the door handle too hard, I will get upset.  I don't like them running around or jumping as it may stress the underlying floor.  I get nervous whenever they carry a plate or glass of milk, fearing they may drop it.  Normal people don't think this way.  I worry I'll instill this general sense of unease in them.

As you can imagine I am not the most pleasant person to be around during these times and it will often lead to me getting angry with my wife or children because they're either impeding my progress, or doing something that I don't like.  I am aware that it is a problem, and it bothers me, but I cannot overcome it.  This is not the kind of father or husband I want to be.  I wish I could just be this happy-go-lucky father able to focus on the more important things in life.  Instead I'm always carrying this immense anxiety and tension which in turn affects my family.

Any advice?,1,1.0,1716917982.0,"This is a tough post to put out, because I truthfully don’t know what to do in my life right now. I can say that my family struggles with mental health very frequently and have had issues with suicide/suicidal thoughts as well as severe depression, including myself. However, my brother who is in the army has reached a new low. He and I haven’t had the best relationship at all really (long story). But he’s still my brother. 

Right now he’s been with this girlfriend who’s been contacting my parents and I to let us know about his poor mental health. Supposedly, he’s been drinking insane amounts of alcohol and doing coke with some “friends” to the point he’s blackout and falling asleep on the floor by the time she wakes up. He’s been borrowing loads of money from my parents to pay off rent and other fees, as well as treating them the same way I remember growing up, aka poorly and ungrateful. His girlfriend and he have had arguments where he just shouts at her which has led to near breakups but it seems he always threatens and tells her that he’s going to commit suicide but he has “some things he needs to take care of first”. He doesn’t answer any of my texts nor my parents so it’s hard to get in touch with him and even if we do, he brushes everything off like it’s fine and nothing's wrong. He refuses to get help or take any medication which makes things much harder as he also compares alcohol similar to anti-depressants. 

Recently, he was charged for being AWOL as he didn’t show up to work one day. Thankfully, after he told his girlfriend he was planning to start the car in the garage, she told one of his higher-ups in the army that he was suicidal and was thankfully put on suicide watch. She has told me not to tell my parents this or act like I know if I get in touch with him because he'll only get even more angry at her but even then it seems he’ll never talk to me either way. Like I said, he never answers my texts or calls and rarely answers my parents. Even if he does he’ll just lie about everything going on in his life. Bless my parents as they’ve both dealt with enough pain in their lives, but they don’t exactly know how to approach others when it comes to theirs and I’m sure it would destroy them if anything were to truly happen to him. My brother is a complete narcissist in my eyes and has always been that way, but I can’t just ignore it. 

If anyone could give me some advice or any way I can approach him/it, I would be extremely grateful.

Internal Resistance to do Things after moving to a new city,1,1.0,1716917637.0,"So I shifted to a new city after planning to do so for more than 6 - 8 months, I was really excited and hopeful for this move as I thought it meant a new exciting life with growth. I finally landed a gig and found a house and surprisingly it was not such a tough relocation. Its been 2 months since the move and about 1 month since I moved into a new place, while the second month I kept myself busy with getting the house fixed and finally feeling at home. I'm starting to feel a deep resistance to do anything. I work as a freelancer and its very important to keep networking and work on your own stuff, but somehow after moving into my new house my mind and body have just given up the hunger and will to do things, and are not feeling motivated.\[I thought I wanted to work very hard.. Is there a change in what i want from life?\] I dont have great savings and my lifestyle is pretty opulent for that, but I just feel like lying on my bed all day. I do have friends but they are busy during the week, I try to workout 2-3 times a week and meet people over the weekends but my days are not as productive as i'd hoped to be. As a freelancer when im at home i dont have much to do, when im working its 12 hour days atleast. I have been subjected to childhood trauma, struggled with procrastination and executive functioning since i was a kid. I've been to my therapist but she doesn't have a lot of answers or explanations about this.

What is happening? What do I do?

Resurfacing Repressed Memories ,1,0.99,1716917518.0,"I think around mid-2022, repressed memories mostly from my school days started resurfacing and I've been ruminating about the same negative memories since. It's properly processing them with anger instead of shame and seeing some things in a new light but they've been taking turns and my reaction to them is always the same. They haven't crossed my mind in the years since they happened but for the past 2 years, anything would trigger a negative memory/ppl that otherwise wouldn't. 

I miss having thoughts of other things when my mind's idle. I miss when my mind didn't use to connect things to negative memories. I miss when the past was just in the past and I moved on with my life or so I thought. I used to be able to read in peace but negative memories that are mostly unrelated play out now. I try to divert as often as I can but it's hard when I'm preoccupied and I've also been slacking and just been letting them be which provokes the same reaction and I'm tired of being mad about the same things I already got over with. It gets especially bad here and then when it spirals before I catch it and I'm down for hours. I wonder if there's any way I can ever go back to being unaware or is that impossible now that the Pandora's box has been opened? Am I supposed to just live with this? There's no way I'm turning 22 and I'm ruminating about opps from 12! 

What could've caused this? I isolated myself for nearly 2 years since mid-2021 and only came out after a negative experience where I had an urge to come out again so I thought it was probably the isolation but I've already been isolated for long periods before and these had never come out. I did my research and it says they're resurfacing because it's safe to do so now but it was safe during those long periods too but why just 2 years ago? Then I thought there's the possibility of them only coming out at 19 because of frontal lobe development. Was it really just about time or could I have prevented this if I had continued living normally?

I'm scared (TW),1,1.0,1716872159.0,"I'm not sure what to do, and I know that saying this online to a bunch of strangers isn't going to help but I felt like typing it out somewhere.

I've struggled with self-harm and suicdal thoughts(and attempts) in the past. For a while I've been doing pretty good, no major self-harm(I've relapsed a couple times but nothing too big), no attempts, I was happier than usual and it was fucking great. I was using a technique where I planned something I was really exited for and would be able to look forward to doing it, things like concerts, conventions, etc.

I live in a very rural area and am a minor who doesn't have a drivers license or a car, so I can't go many places. Me and one of my friends just went to the convention that we had planned about a year ago, and it was amazing. I made friends, did karaoke, cosplayed, danced, had a great time in general. However, it's over now. I don't have any more plans, I can't make more because there's nothing to do.

I'm scared. I'm relapsing again, and I don't want to kill myself, but I might kill myself because I don't know if I want to be alive, and I don't know what to do. I'm scared of myself and of everyone around me, and I don't know what to do about it because I can't talk to anyone I know without messing everything up. I'm scared that I  ruined everything for my friends just by bringing up mental health before. 

Also, while this isn't as important, it's probably contributing to this. While at the convention, a pedophile started hitting on me, and saying creepy things, knowing that I was a minor. He asked me and my friend weird questions, like what self defense weapons we had, then started explaining how he could still kidnap us even with the weapons. It was weird, and gave me huge PTSD from being groped by pedos when I was younger. Like I said, this isn't the main thing, but it's probably contributing to it.

Now that the convention is over, I'm stuck in a house that's nowhere near any of my friends. I don't know what to do and I'm relapsing again. I'm scared that i'm going to kill myself, not immediately, but gradually.

Can you please guide me in changing my thinking process? ,1,1.0,1716887347.0,"

Hi! I've always noticed that the things, goals, or people I wanted in my life so badly somehow never came to fruition. In my childhood, I accepted this casually. But since 2020, it seems like something is always holding me back from achieving what I desire.

Currently, I'm pursuing an engineering degree in CSE, but I don't feel any motivation to complete it, even though I used to be a good student. I wanted to get into my desired institution so badly, but my boyfriend broke up with me the day before my admission test. I couldn't focus the next day and, as a result, didn't get in. I loved him so much that I waited for his return for two years after our breakup. I barely moved on and got used to his absence.

Then, I met someone who was intelligent and shared my imaginative thinking. We decided to get married at the end of the year, and I introduced him to my family. However, he decided that my family wouldn't accept his drug addiction, and I wouldn't be able to handle it either. So, he wanted to break up. For the past five months, we haven't been in touch. I had a panic attack a few days ago and called him, but he didn't respond and told me to accept that we are no longer together.

I have many things to do in my life right now. I should start my GRE preparation because I want to pursue a Ph.D. in the USA. I also got an internship offer yesterday, which starts in September. My university GPA is still below 3 out of 4, so I need to study hard to improve it. But I can't seem to do any of this. I always feel so numb and worthless. I can't sleep without taking 3-4 sleeping pills. If I don't take them, my panic attacks start. I feel paralyzed, my chest feels heavy, and these episodes last for 6-7 hours. A few months ago, it took 20 minutes to recover, but now it's getting worse. I even tried to commit suicide, but I'm afraid of failing and being judged.

I don't know what to do now. Can anyone please help me out?

I can't remember anything past today,2,1.0,1716916881.0,"I've always noticed I've had issues with my memory. I would do things such as tests or work and not remember doing it. The same can be said about anything I've ever said. People will tell my that I said A or did B, and I will have no memory of it whatsoever. 
A big one that made me realize was the fact I went by a different name for a year or more. 
I was going through this string of text messages that was labeled as me(another story for another time) and saw them call me another name. I was really confused because I thought the chat was about me but it was a different name? I came to the conclusion that I had gone by a different name, but I don't remember at all. 
There are other things such as not remembering what I've done yesterday or having no memory of the last couple weeks.
What I do know is hard facts. Facts are what is keeping me from completely losing my mind. Without these hard facts, I worry I will lose myself to my memory. 
Ps. I am not old enough to have any dementia or anything like that as far as I know. So, I have no clue what is wrong with me.",mentalhealth,Kspurgatory,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d2owp1/i_cant_remember_anything_past_today/,1,2.0,0.0,4.293126061207098e-06
Guys I'm super confused,1,1.0,1716903346.0,"So my question is, why is this happening? When I was 9 I was home alone with my cousin, we were playing then I hear whispers behind a glass door, I look over and I saw a pale woman wearing a white sleepwear behind the glass door. I asked my cousin and she said she didn't see anything. That's probably the only time I get to see her but until now I can still hear the whispers at night or tapping at morning, occasionally at tutoring session and in my home. Sometimes I even sees an object as a part of her body but not face at all. I never seen her face I only see her body, her hair, how she dress. Just today I hear tapping and whispering while doing a test. It scares me a lot, have anyone experience this or know what's this?

It's nice to know I'm not wanted.,1,1.0,1716906073.0,"My little sister just turned 12, to me she's always been spoiled, gotten what she wanted and treated like a princess whilst I was ignored and left on my own to suffer with the loss of our father. I just always felt she was treated way different to me and when she was younger she would say she's a princess and whilst I was nothing, I think she still holds on to that belief. She doesn't care if something's yours she will just take and there are virtually no consequences for it, when she looses her phone she's all nice trying to use ours or just pretending she actually gives a shit, yet when she gets it back she horrible treats me and the rest of our family like shit, I'm home every Friday and Wednesday and I clean the house so our mom can relax after work but when she gets back before she does she trashes the house and ruins everything and nothing gets done about her. I love my sister but she doesn't love me and she showed it today when she actively said she didn't want me to go to the cinema with her for her birthday even though it's a family function.

My daughter is scaring me tonight. No idea how to help.,921,0.98,1702090229.0,"My daughter (10) very suddenly this evening said she feels like she's in a dream/ like she's not real/ like she's a ghost. Said she feels like she's going to die. She doesn't look great, almost like she's sick, but she says she isn't sick except for feeling like she's going to die. Her pulse is normal.

I had her take a shower, brushed her hair and she put on her jammies. Tucked her bed with beach sounds and told her to relax and picture being at the beach. Walked in a couple of minutes later and she's crying.

I'm really worried but completely clueless. My husband thinks it's her ADHD/Adderall, but this has never happened before. She has been very moody and temperamental lately.

My mother having sex with me in the same room damaged my relationship with sex,611,0.97,1696888783.0,"When I was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend. Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.

Saw someone die yesterday,561,0.99,1682901107.0,"Yesterday while I getting on the bus after work , a boy that was getting off stepped into traffic without looking and got hit by a car that sent him flying in front of the bus. It happened so fast that I didn’t even finish paying for my ticket yet. Everyone came up to try and help him until the ambulance got there but the amount of blood and how far the car launched him, I knew he wasn’t going to make it. The EMTs got there, checked his pulse and immediately got him on the stretcher and used the defibrillators. The ambulance rode off. No sirens. No lights. No nothing. I got up and just walked back to my job in total shock. All I could and have been thinking about is the brief couple of seconds where I was able to see him before he died. Looked like a teenager and he looked like he just got off of work himself. I especially remember his long dreadlocs because some of them had ripped out and was laying in the street. Tried to tell my family what I saw and it seemed like no one cared, especially my mom. She seemed more upset that she had to come pick me up while she doing Lyft. After the shock faded I thought I was okay until I tried going to sleep. That entire part of my day kept playing back on loop. Couldn’t sleep so tried watching tv but I couldn’t pay attention to what was going on. Then I started thinking about all the times I’ve stepped into the street without thinking for hours. My body eventually gave out and went to sleep. Woke up feeling like shit so I asked my mom for a ride to work. During the ride she asked me why I looked depressed. Didn’t say anything. Then she asked me if I was able to complete some chore yesterday and when I said no she started going off on me. Telling me that I’m lazy and I don’t care about anything. I got angry and yelled at her and told her imma still fucked up from yesterday and she told me to “toughen up and leave that shit in the past. You didn’t know him “ after that I asked her to just drop me off wherever because I just was sick of her attitude. I eventually got to work but I had to walk past the spot he got hit at. I cried. Couldn’t help it. Felt like a total bitch but I just couldn’t help it. My entire shift was just me mourning a total stranger. I know it’s probably stupid but it’s just how I am.

I think I have PTSD from my wife giving birth.,456,0.95,1704735467.0,"Let me start with I know that what a woman goes through in labor is incredibly hard and challenging on them both mentally and physically. 

So my wife got induced Friday morning and things progressed fine all day. They gave her an epidural at 4PM Friday and things were good. Around midnight the baby’s heart rate dropped which caused my wife’s to drop.. 

We had every nurse on the floor in our room in seconds. They flipped her on hands and knees, woke the on-site surgeon and started prepping the OR and a crash team. They got her and the baby stabilized in about 15 min. So that was at midnight. 

She labored through until it caused too much stress on her body so they sedated her and put her on oxygen for a few hours around 4 AM Saturday. She progressed to a little over 9cm. 

Around 9:30AM Saturday she gradually stopped having contractions and essentially going backwards.

 They ended having to doing an emergency c section at 11ish. 

When the baby came out he wasn’t breathing and didn’t for the first 5 min. They had to resuscitate him all the while they had a hard time stopping my wife’s bleeding. So. Much. Blood…. It was all over.. The drs discovered some infection while they had her opened up and had to look for more infection which took them longer. I watched them pull my wife’s insides out asking for help with the bleeding and the NICU nurses flip my child’s lifeless body around to get him breathing. 

So I bounced around the operating room  between my wife and child checking on them for like 20 minutes being completely helpless. 

Both baby and mama have gotten the all clear and are at home recovering. No immediate issues with either of them.  I know it’s silly to be upset because we came home and are doing okay when so many people don’t get that opportunity. I just can’t get the OR out of my head. It’s playing over and over.

The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me.

am i in the wrong for reporting a consensual sexual encounter?,436,0.95,1686266074.0,"so basically i (21f) was baker acted (for those who don’t know it’s a mandatory 72 hour hospital stay for mental health) after, in my case, a suicide attempt. the hospital brought me to the psych ward, and i was put on suicide watch overnight there at 10pm. the guy (27m) who was the one watching me immediately started flirting, making super sexual comments, asking to see my body, etc. he was hot and i was in such a dark place so obviously i played along. like when he came in i was crying and saying how worthless i felt, etc. anyways, he started saying how much he wanted to have sex with me and how much he wanted to kiss me, so eventually he told me that if i went into the bathroom he would “have to follow me” since that was part of the suicide watch. in the bathroom we made out, and did other things, but not actual sex. this went on basically all night (10pm-7am), having sexual conversations, making out, talking about how we would meet up when i got out (he would get me pregnant and we would run away together), he got my phone number, etc. he gave me a fake name, and i later found out that he was married with a child. 

it was all consensual in the moment, like i never told him no, but thinking back on it i feel like he took advantage of the mental state i was in, and his position of power to get what he wanted. it feels like when a police officer gets with someone they arrested. 

all that to say, i feel like i did the wrong thing. i don’t know if i’m a victim. i feel like i ruined this man’s life over something that i said yes to.

I don't have a job. I could theoretically work a job, but I would not perform well at the job at all and possibly get fired for being unproductive, it would also do more harm than good to me. But the main reason I don't have a job is because a job would drain my time and energy, which I desperately need to work on my physical and mental health and also my to-do list at home, I just cannot handle any more responsibilities currently. Its too much, im already fighting a battle 24/7 and I do not wanna attempt to work even harder than what is physically possible.

""you should"" ""why dont you"" but when I reply that I don't have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do, they reply that I'm just lazzy and privileged.

Im not as valuable or as important as men. Just an object/ baby making machine. I’ll never be seen as a human or worth anything. 

It kills me knowing how women in other countries are treated. Some cant go to school or have control over their own bodies. 

I have to carry sprays and weapons with me if i wanna go for a quick walk around my neighborhood cuz sm stuff happens and i dont feel safe. 

I’ll never be as respected as a man. I’ll never be as strong as men are. I have no way of protecting myself, im just weak and pathetic and it makes me want to scream and cry

My husband doesn't listen to me, so I decided to ask for it in my husband's therapy session.

I went in, bravely outlined marital abuse, and then confidently walked into asking for a divorce and how that would look. And my husband's therapist freaked out on me. He raised his voice, he put his hand up and shushed me several times . He was telling me I wasn't allowed to get a divorce. He said I could get one when my husband was also ready. He said that many times. I'm not nervous with therapists so I was assertive and held my boundaries. But I feel shaken by it today.

 I flipped and punched him and started shouting at him that ‘he isn’t allowed to act like he’s better than me after raping her’.

She would make me shower with her from 10-13 even though I was showering by myself during this time and she would wash my private parts with her hands, not a wash cloth.

 I felt weird about it but didn’t say anything. I would also lay down in the bed with her and she would start touching my inner thighs but nothing further. Also, she would make me and my brothers rub her feet but she would make weird moaning noises and said that she had a foot fetish. She also made a weird joke about how she would show me what it’s like to get molested and tried taking my clothes off jokingly?? I remember being very uncomfortable.

When I was around 14, I told her that I had a boyfriend and she slammed me on the ground and made me tell her information about him and would not let me go. 

 Also, (last month) I was dealing with issues with constipation and she bought me this laxative device that you have to stick in your butt to do. I have trauma from that era specifically because I was raped in July and she knows that, she even knows that specific area is just a source of trauma. But, she made me take off my pants and kept insisting that she put it in her for me. I kept saying no and that I would do it myself but she kept pushing me. 

I literally was screaming no and she said that my stepdad does it for her all the time. Eventually, I started crying and having PTSD flashbacks so she eventually backed off and apologized. I don’t know what to make of any of this?

My parents were having sex next to me and it fucked me up,318,0.94,1694159407.0,"Hi guys. Just wanted to vent a bit about some of my childhood traumatic experieces.
When I was a child my parents had been having sex next to me in the same bed. My first memories are from around when I was 5 years old. They were doing it thinking I was asleep but I was too scared to tell them I am not and that I see and understand everything. I started then to make some noises during their sex so they could feel uncomfortable and they stopped doing it since I was about 7 because they moved me into my own room.
The thing is that it made me sexual way too young. I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...
I feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.

I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,308,0.98,1685151418.0,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

Found out my daughter is cutting herself,304,0.99,1682390747.0,"I (32F) just found out my (13F) daughter is cutting herself. She said it’s been going on for a little more than a week. Her brother was the one who told me.

She showed me them and they are superficial and don’t need immediate medical attention.

I tried to remain calm and just not overreact or panic. I let her know that I’m sorry she was feeling so strongly that she resorted to hurting herself and I let her know that I don’t think badly of her and I want to help her.

She agreed that she would like to get help so we are going to get a referral from her doctor for a therapist on Wednesday.

She said she does it to relieve stress and when she’s feeling upset but that it isn’t a suicide attempt. I let her know that we need to find another way for her to release stress since this is dangerous.
I took her with me to work and school today so we could spend some extra time together. 

I’m not sure what else I can do. I’m trying to keep it together but I do feel terrible that she is feeling so low. I wish I could take all her pain away.

Edit: *Update*
Thanks for all the support! Even though I tried my hardest to do what was best it still felt like I wasn’t doing enough so it was very reassuring reading through everyone’s comments and experiences. 

We got a referral from her pediatrician so now we are waiting for therapy. In the mean time we have been doing more activities together and she has been a lot more open to trying stuff. 

Yesterday was rough because I spent some one-on-one time with my son (9) and she felt a little betrayed after we were spending so much time together. At first she didn’t want to talk to me but eventually she came around and I told her it’s normal to feel that way and she’s still important even if I spend time with her brother. 

My son has ADHD (and possibly autism, we are in the process of getting an evaluation) so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside. It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn’t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don’t allow children under 15. 

She even stopped wearing her jacket which I felt like was huge so I think we are making good progress. Just hoping we can stick with it through hard times as well.",mentalhealth,BrainQuilt,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/12y5qp6/found_out_my_daughter_is_cutting_herself/,87
What the fuck did my older brother just do?,307,0.95,1711828799.0,"Hello. I'll post this because I am really... utterly disgusted and in disbelief of what just happened. I might delete this later or whatever, I don't use reddit that much.

For context, I'm F18. I left our home at the age of 17 to enter a state university miles long away from our home. It takes me months to return home and I came back for a week long vacation (for long holidays) last Monday. Since I will be returning back to the city I'm currently studying in tomorrow, I wanted to at least bond and catch up with my older brothers since I've been away for months. We weren't that close, but I understood them more now since I've accepted to just let things be (again for context, my older brother stopped in college and currently out of school youth).

I was with them (my siblings' room), we were having fun, my 2nd older brother [M21] was in the lower bunk bed and me and my oldest brother [M22] was together in the top bunk. We were laughing and all, playing games, then my brother hugged me while I was playing games in his phone while we were also chatting. It looked sweet to me because we were not really touchy, he's introverted, and I innocently thought that we're getting closer. While having fun chatting and all, he kept on caressing my stomach and asked where's my navel at, and he touched, caressed it so much that I felt gross and laughingly told him not to touch it while still playing the game. 

He then on proceeded to fucking ask ""where should I touch you then"" and unhesitatingly put his fucking disgusting hands on my chest LIKE IT WAS FUCKING NOTHING and whispered ""here? can I touch you here? please let me"" LIKE A FUCKING UNEDUCATED CREEP. I was so grossed out and can't think properly at the moment so I chose laugh it off and got out of their room saying I'm sleepy already and needed to rest since I still have a long travel for tomorrow.

It was so, so fucking creepy since I didn't expect my brother to be like that. In context, my 2nd older brother is just the same. He also did something like that when I was a minor. And I was raped when I was in preschool. I know nothing at that age, but I remember it until now. I allowed that person to do it because I know nothing... I really don't know nothing. I was so vulnerable. I was just a child. When my parents asked why my medical results says that there was blood in my vagina and all, I was so nervous, scared, and got angry at them. I didn't understand it, but in my mind I was so scared if they knew (it's like having sex and telling your parents you had sex at that age). Looking back, it was so gross and I just wanna cry. I don't want to elaborate it further about what happened afterwards. I tried to forget... even until now.

Please... please help. I've been through a lot. Not just this but things way worse than an 18-year-old should experience. Please help me😭 what should I do it felt so fucking, fucking gross like it won't ever fade away even if I scrub all over my body and bath again and again. I feel so dirty. I am so fucking mad right now. I was reminded with everything. Am I still supposed to understand, knowing that these guys know no shit?

TW: What they don't tell you about hanging yourself,295,0.99,1699207870.0,"A much needed premise: I miraculously survived hanging myself back in February of this year.

It was not the first time I attempted unaliving myself but it was the first time I was actually going to be successful if things hadn't turned out the way the did.

I had done my research about this. I could not fathom doing it any other ways that I thought were ""too painful and gory"", either for me or for the person who would find me.

So, after that, I was hospitalized for a month and a half and they changed my meds after 3 years and I have to say I am now in a much better mental state and ready to talk about this.

If you ever thought about doing this you may have a picture in your head of how it's going to go. I had it too and it couldn't be further from the truth of what happened.

So here's the reality check:

Firsts things first, it is not ""painless"" at all, it is not ""slowly drifting to sleep"". Your body will get SO MAD that you are doing this and it will react in the worst and most painful ways possible.

To start, you won't have control over your limbs. I remember seeing my arms in front of me with the hands all tensed up like a zombie. It felt like my tendons were slowly getting shorter and shorter and I couldn't move them. I always thought when the survival instinct would kick in the arms would go up to the rope in an attempt to lift yourself up. And it's true that your brain will think that, but trust me, you will have NO CONTROL over your movements. You want to lift the arms up overhead and they just slap around aimlessly.

Then you will feel like your head is going to explode and your eyes are going to pop out. I felt my whole face go warmer and warmer and starting to tingle like crazy.

And that's not even the worst part: it was the lungs for me. You see, your body will get to a state of primal survival instinct where it will do anything it can to just catch a breath. But since the airways are blocked, your whole torso will tense in and out with so much force that your lungs and stomach hurt like hell. Think of a worm curling up when you touch it. Your body will do the same over and over, in and out, each movement more and more painful than the previous one. And it's not like you can control it. You can't. My whole abs and back muscles hurt as if I had fallen from 3 stories for like 2 weeks afterwards just from the effort my body was making by trying to get some oxygen.

I won't even go into how it ends because it's just fucking scary. I'll just say that there's a point where you have the lucid thought of ""I am dying, and there's nothing I can do about it"". And it's the most terrifying yet real feeling ever. It's not ""calm and peaceful"" like you make it out to be in your mind before doing it. It's sheer panic. And when you have this thought it's like it lasts a millisecond but you're now stuck in this state that doesn't leave you.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I feel like some people need to hear this. I certainly would have had second thoughts had I known it in advance.

I won't go into how I survived because I honestly still feel guilty and embarrassed about it. Just know I had to be resuscitated twice and can't remember a thing after that panic feeling. That would have been the last feeling I ever felt. Not peace, not relief.

I am now convinced there's absolutely no ""painless"" way to go and I'm scared as hell for when it will be my time to go in the future. I still have these feelings sometimes, to end it all but I have to admit I am now an official coward.

So yeah, would not recommend. It was NOT worth it. Just delay that feeling for as long as possible, trust me.",mentalhealth,,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/17ohtpv/tw_what_they_dont_tell_you_about_hanging_yourself/,27

We went to the doctor. Then the hospital (I was flabbergasted they didn’t admit him). Last night it all went to hell. He got hyper fixated on my son. I was very concerned so I called his grandma to take him back to the hospital because I was going on three nights mo sleep watching over him. He thought my my 21 year old son was in his room with his (my partner’s) ex girlfriend. He kept running up to his room insisting he needed help. I managed to get him outside and made my son lock himself in the house. 

Then it came to a head. He started ranting and raving and screaming. I tried everything. I tried pretending like he made sense. I tried begging. I tried singing. Finally I saw his Mamaw pulling in. Then my partner, the man whom until a few days ago I had never even had a real argument with pounced on me. We went down and starting grappling. My glasses flew off. He tried to get me in a choke hold but I went under and got my throat out of his grasp but I still couldn’t get away. I was screaming “it’s me it’s me stop”. I thought the love of my life was going to kill me in the headlights of his grandmas car. His Mamaw and papaw approached. That seemed to affect him. I was able to wriggle away and I just ran home.

Please Stop Recommending Pets as a Mental Health Fix,283,0.96,1696445562.0,"I’ve seen this several times under a lot of posts on this Reddit, and I’m not saying pets don’t help. I don’t want to discount the experiences of people who says pets have helped with their mental illnesses, and I don’t want to discredit scientific studies that suggest having a pet elevates your mood.  However, a pet is a living creature that requires a lot of care, and if you are so depressed it is hard to keep up with your responsibilities, a pet might add to your stress rather than helping relieving it. This really reminds me of those couples who fight and fight and they think having a baby will fix their relationship. 

Please remember that pets aren’t props used to help humans, they are living creatures with their own feelings and needs. I don’t want to discourage you from getting a pet, but please only get one if you can take care of it, not just to help with your mental health.

I think about ending things or feeling like no one will love someone that’s paid for sex. It was after my wife cheated on my and I got a divorce that I spiraled out of control. I’m in such a dark place now from what I’ve done and I just want to feel like my life matters. They were good people I apologize to one of them but both girls I talked to didn’t seem to mind what we did. It seems it bothers me more than anyone. I feel like it’s a secret that eats me alive and I want to tell everyone I did it and regret it. I don’t want anyone to know at the same time. I’m so lost I just don’t want to feel this dread.

Sex is disgusting sometimes- I think I might know why?,237,0.92,1712155817.0,"I lived with my dad for a little period of time and did always go to his cottage whenever I was off school. One thing was- he would always fuck his girlfriend/wife at the time very loudly. At some point I started getting really annoyed by it because I would storm out of the house screaming “STOP having sex when I’m here”. It kept happening. I was glad it happened in a different room but you don’t understand how SMALL this cottage was. I could hear everything and that girl would do it on purpose so I could hear it.  They would do it in their room and do it in the bathroom. It echoed so much. 

It was always the have loud vigorous sex, come out of the room with such confidence and going to the kitchen table to have a cigarette and a coffee. That’s the pattern. Daily. Constantly.

I knew she did it on purpose because my relationship was always terrible with the girl. She was jealous of a young girl because my dad loved me. I was jealous of her because I knew she didn’t deserve my dad and that she was pushing him away from me.

I think it got to a rotten point where I got myself off on it because I was so used to it happening every night. I think this part is what is getting me... I was only 11/12-13 at the time doing all of this. It only continued from there until I moved out. There was nothing I could do but wait on the couch and sleep there until it was over. I didn’t realize how fucked up it was to do what I was doing. But truly -because I was so exposed that -I thought it was normal to do so. I think it’s affected me even now just because of what they did- and what I’ve done while that was all happening. I feel cursed. Disgusting. Confused. Vile. Sad. Desensitized. Not normal.

I continue to think about it Til this day, and it grosses me out and sometimes it will pop up in really awkward moments. I feel a rise of anger when I hear any form of moaning or sighing- I get scared or weirded or grossed out while trying to have sex. I will have flashbacks when having sex. I get fear from it sometimes. I hate to be touched sometimes- and it has a lot to do with this.

-I’ve also been through some weird instances where my dad would slap my ass “as a joke”. Who does that all the way up til they’re 13?
- I used to be laying on the couch and I swear to god at some point he was watching porn around me. He was doing it in the kitchen at the table. I know this because I heard the moaning and at the time there was only me and him around the cottage 


-stumbled onto my dads only laptop and found a bunch of legging porn videos.. also stumbled onto his only camera and found nudes of his gf. I’m finding all of this at the age of 11-13 years old.

-edit: my dad and the girlfriend left me alone a lot with the girlfriends son and daughter at the time. The daughter same age as me and the son 16. At the time I was 13. we were in my dad’s girlfriend’s cottage. The son had a few drinks and he started to give me a small amount of attention and sleazily asked me to be his girlfriend that night. Later on he pressures me into giving him a BJ and I do it because I want a boyfriend - and the morning after he breaks up with me. Stone cold. I actually thought we were gonna be together but he actually just used me- then becomes my step brother  a few years after. I think I got really lucky for being the heavier/ fat girl at the time because it would take a lot more for him to take MORE advantage of me than he already did. It was my FIRST memorable sexual experience that was NOT good. He kicked me out of the room right after he couldn’t nut.

I also have a faint memory of being around the age of 5 and playing with a younger boy and we were in a closet stripping. Thankfully we got caught. I asked my mom and my sister if that ever happened because clearly the other mom probably would make a scene out of it knowing what just happened - but they both said they don’t recollect this at all. I think I’m going insane with this guilt of being so young but also pushing myself onto another person that way.

It just gets really fucked up. Also people think this is a LARP.. which is really really sad. Because this legit has happened. What am I lying about for. I smoke weed daily just to not cry- I have self harm scars from when I was ten just from crying for ANY form of attention. I have physical and mental regrets throughout everything I’ve been through. I can’t lie.

I finally got a therapist that’s good at her job and now I am livid.,205,0.99,1688760333.0,"Alright, I got a story for y’all. 

I had an eye opening therapy session yesterday, and I just wanna share about how I never realized things that happen to us as a child can have such lasting subconscious impacts on us for the rest of our lives. 

Ima bout to get real with y’all, and share an experience that happened to me. 

This is something I have a suppressed memory about it, and because of the way adults have portrayed it to me growing up, I always told it as a haha funny story. These fvckers spoke about it as if it were a joke and now I’m angry.

Something about me, is if I ever feel as though I’m in trouble I shut down. I go non verbal, and it’s hard to come out of. Therapist asked about it, and when I first felt that as a child. I first said something about being put in the corner as a child and if i talked I had to stay longer. But then it hit me. 

As a child, I had pretty bad adhd (still do) and would never stop talking. Got on a lot of people’s nerves. So, one night a relative was babysitting me. I was younger than 5. (Likely around 3/4) I wouldn’t stop talking and bothering her. 

So what does this relative do? Duck tapes my hands and feet to a bed and put tape over my mouth, and left me in a room until my mom came back to get me. 

My mom was livid. Unfortunately she’s passed since so I can’t ask her about it. 

After that, adults, my father included would ride around with duck tape on the dash of their cars and threaten me with it if I misbehaved. 

Every time that story was brought up by the people in my life, it was told as a funny story, so that became my association with it. To this day, it’s brought up as a funny memory. 

I just never made the connection before about it. 

But now, having my own kids and thinking about someone doing that to my toddler, nah I’d be in jail right now. 

That’s not even the worst of what’s happened to me as a child, but now I just want to call my father and tell him with as much disrespect as I can give, Fvck you.

She was suffering from terminal lung cancer and was in horrible daily pain. She had gotten her diagnosis just a few months ago, and although it was terminal my family wasn’t expecting her to go so soon. We really thought we’d have a lot more time with her. We actually had a cookout planned that day so the family could come over and spend time with her. I can’t get the image of her slumped over in her chair out of my head. Seeing her pale face and my heart just stopping. Trying to wake her up even though I knew she was gone. I feel so numb and I don’t understand why. I feel like I should be crying more but I just can’t anymore. Nothing feels real. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. It doesn’t feel fair. I feel like I’ve been robbed. I have so much anger I don’t know where to direct. My mother didn’t deserve to die so early nor should anyone have to lose their parent so young. These past few months leading up to this I’ve been in a depressed haze, cutting off friends and isolating myself. I was starting to feel the loneliest I’d ever felt in my life but now I think this is it. I have nobody to talk to about this. I’m just so sad. Support or advice would be appreciated.

UPDATE: I don’t use Reddit much so I’m not sure if everyone who replied will get notifications for this: 

I just wanted to post a update and thank everyone who has taken their time to comment and reach out .  you guys have no idea how much all this support has meant to me. These past few hours have been extremely rough. I’m not going to lie, I’m still a bit numb. I just can’t believe my mother, the women I’ve known my entire life is gone. I will never see her again. It shatters my heart all over again every time I’m reminded. My mother was the most caring and beautiful women I’ve even known. The morning she passed, she woke me up very early at 2am asking if I was okay. This was very unlike her. I’d like to think in some way she knew what was coming and wanted to spend some time with me before she left. My best friend and I recently reconnected right before my moms passing, they have been keeping me company which has been really helpful. Surprisingly I’ve been laughing a lot these last 2 days more than crying. I think my mom would have wanted that for me. Although I’m still incredibly lonely and depressed about her passing, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. As my mother is no longer suffering in pain, she’s completely at peace now and where she always wanted: in the afterlife with my grandparents ❤️

Wife is going through breakdown and told me she wants to divorce,190,0.98,1694973549.0,"My wife of almost 15 years (we have been together for 21) decided she wanted to divorce me suddenly before a work trip. She knew I was going alone and would be isolated. 

I spent the first few days in a hotel room in a strange country in complete shock. All the emotions ran through my head. I blamed myself, every little comment said. 

A few years ago she suffered from an incredibly paranoid phase (thanks a lot pandemic) where she thought the neighbours were spying on her and everyone was out to get her. I work away a lot so I'd come home to find her in this state. The ""cameras"" always ended up being garden lights or motion activated lamps, but when I pointed this out (after 6 months not so tactfully) she seemed to withdraw from me. 

After that we had a yoyoing relationship, where she would tell me one moment she loves me, the next a divorce. We always sorted it out because I love her and want to support her and the kids unconditionally. 

I noticed her withdrawing. She would be in the same room with me, but not in spirit. She would explode at me in anger for the smallest things, and the big things she wouldn't seem to care about. 

She decided to go on medication, which helped. Although she became more of a robot and lost all interest in any form of intimacy. It broke my heart. 

She came off of them about a year ago and things started to improve. We became physical (although at the worst of times she would have sex with me and throw it in my face on the next angry outburst, calling it rape etc. I never forced her into sex at all, but did complain we weren't intimate many times). 

So, this latest situation was only three days ago. I'm still in a hotel halfway across the world, but my father rang me this morning. 

Apparently she stayed at a female friend of ours house last night because she thought the neighbours were spying on her. She told me that she is hated in the area and that she will be sent back to her home country (she has been living in the UK for over 20 years and is from Europe) and the kids taken away. She strongly believes it to be true. 

My father picked her and the kids up and she adamantly wanted to report everything to the police regarding it. The police obviously didn't take it seriously. Our neighbours are all 80'ish years old and not malicious. A pain, but not malicious. 

So as I sat here, pulling the threads on everything bad I'd done (because she will often use anything I've done wrong as ammo) when I get a call saying a mental health nurse is visiting her. She's at my Dad's with the kids. 

I love her with all my heart. She's a fantastic mother and person. But she will just torture me over and over and I stay because of this love. I worry about the kids and how she'll cope. It breaks my heart. 

So I just carry on working, supporting her and trying to build our family. I've turned into a persuer it seems, trying to hold us all together. Always initiating conversations. Trying to understand her feelings. She wouldn't make the effort to talk first. 

Did she really mean she wanted a divorce? Or is this just symptoms of her MH? I can't leave her when she needs me, and although this is effecting me I can take it. I want her to be safe and feel better but she's breaking me down with the constant swings in feelings towards me.  She is an amazing person at her best, but at her worst it's like Jekyll and Hyde. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so what was the outcome?

I was arrested straight off the plane. They aarested me on suspicion of Rape and coercion.  I was taken straight to the police station and was just released pending investigations.

I've picked my car up, but I'm not allowed to contact her, go to the house without police escort, go to her place of work (which I wouldn't) go to the school. Where my kids attend or ask anyone to talk to her for me.

I've never raped her. She thinks having sex because she felt guilty whilst not objecting is rape because she didn't really want it. She's saying this happened multiple times. I'm feeling broken

Looking at the past history, I think she has BPD. The re-writing of the past, the annoyances at very minor things. Disassociation and acting. Obviously this isn't a proper diagnosis, but reading it all was a lightbulb moment.  I think I've been discarded.

Sexual encounter has left me utterly broken,171,0.93,1698153580.0,"TW: SA/Infidelity

Long story short, I (25M) blacked out at a party and when I came to I was naked, had thrown up. I had sex with someone. I remember some bits: 

Saying I needed to go. 

Stopping the girl from holding my hand. 

Asking to stop and offering oral sex instead. I think I said “If I go down instead, can we stop?”

Worried I’m a pedophile,174,0.86,1700547978.0,"
19M

I wonder if I even AM worried at all. Lately I’ve been feeling apathetic towards my mental issues/habits. Hell, I don’t even feel annoyed/bothered by the things that usually annoy/bother me. The worry feels fake, I think. Then again, my “self-aware” thoughts tend to feel fake.

But anyways, I met this person on Discord and we both produce music. I showed them my music, they showed me theirs. They were fun to talk to, and it felt completely platonic. They asked me if I was an adult, and I said I was 19. They said they were fifteen. I don’t know if they’re male or female, but something hints at them being female.

Now, I don’t remember feeling any attraction to this right away, no, I don’t think I did. But I think my mind wants to convince me and say “what if you did feel attracted? Maybe you don’t remember.” 

I never fantasized/thought about them sexually or anything, ever. I don’t like to say it, but I did kind of feel a bit attracted, not even sexually. Of course, my mind doubts that and makes me wonder if I do/did feel attracted sexually. But I did daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually)?

The attraction felt more like a romantic one, not sexual. Still, that should bring concern, but I don’t feel concerned. I don’t even feel concerned that I don’t feel concerned. It seems like my mind keeps getting more and more messed up.

————————————————————————

It doesn’t stop here. I sometimes catch myself “looking” at much younger girls, and daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually, more like attracted to my face and just my face), but this hasn’t happened in a long time. I sometimes avoid looking at them this way, and keep my eyes away and instead focus on their face (which doesn’t make me feel attraction, but of course I doubt this).

”Daydreams/fantasies” on my OWN never feature any underage people. 

And of course, I feel apathetic. But, I do think this whole issue is gonna make it a bit more difficult for me to enjoy things.  I wondered if I’d be able to enjoy dancing anymore, because “yeah that guy dances well, but he’s a pedo, so…”

—————————————————————————

If it’s any help, I’ve never used underage characters (like lolis for example) in things like AI chats, only actual adult characters. I’ve never used porn like jailbait porn or “barely legal” or anything like that.

And I am attracted to people my age. I just wrote “too,” but deleted it, and I think that means something.

I also always have the wrong reactions/opinions, like when people say pedophilia isn’t a sexuality, I feel opposed.

———————————————————————————


Edit: Nearly everyone here has told me it sounds like POCD, but I feel like it’s more than that. I can’t deny that I did daydream of little girls being romantically attracted, I can’t deny the attraction to that fifteen year old.

I told the fifteen year old that I couldn’t talk anymore. I then unfriended them. I felt something when I saw their profile, it was only romantic but mild, I think. Mild or not, it was romantic. It quickly went away once I no longer saw their profile, but still, it was there.

26F: cruel internal voice that relentlessly criticizes anything i think or do. anyone else struggle with this,167,1.0,1682605733.0,"Like if I think to go visit my parents the voice says, ‘you’re 26 and you want mommy and daddy, pathetic.’ If I don’t go see them it’s like, ‘Congratulations, do you feel like a big kid now?’

When I was working, it found a way to tell me whatever job I had was pathetic or that I was pathetic to be proud of myself for a job I actually liked. 

As I ease my way back into working after an especially bad depressive episode, that voice laughs at any small steps I take. Whether it’s waking up early or doing one freelance job, taking on a student. Little steps that feel manageable, that voice is laughing at me like ‘you want a fucking standing ovation every time you do the dishes?”

I had a child loss. And I am okay.,167,0.97,1702414318.0,"Hi, about ten months ago (Feb) I had a miscarriage. I saw my dead baby. Yes, it wasn’t just a pile of cells. I’m pro choice, so whatever you would like to call it for yourself, then go right ahead, anyways. 

I’ve been struggling a lot. I loved them so much even though I didn’t know them well. I knew how they made me feel, and what they were doing to my body. I knew I was excited and loved them with my whole heart and body already. 

It took many months after my loss to finally name them. I never got the chance to know them well, so naming was hard. I decided to go with Jordyn or Jordie for short. 

The name Jordie comes from my cousin, who I love so much, and is one of my favourite people. And I love the name Jordyn, especially for a feminine person. 

I’m doing okay. I know that it’s not my fault. My baby wasn’t developing properly, and would have been born either very sick, and miserable, or passed away, like they were. 

They are at peace, and I’m coming to that point now. I miss them everyday. But I also have an amazing partner to help me through everything. 

I’m going to be okay. 
One day, I might meet them again, and who knows in what way?

No matter what, I know they wouldn’t blame me, because Jordyn was sick. 

I am still a parent. 
I am still a mother.

Edit: I identify as enby. They/them. Not a woman, but still a mama🩷🩵🩷

Edit 2: one in four pregnancies end in loss. It’s not as common to lose your baby in the second or third trimesters, but it is just as valid. I lost Jordyn in the second trimester. I was supposed to be 15 ish weeks pregnant, but when they passed away, they were only the size of a 7-8 week baby. I just felt like I wanted to share this information. 

I’m also going into grief counselling to help support myself with my journey of not being a mom anymore. There’s a quote that I really love, it goes like this:

“I carried you every second of your life, and I will miss you every second for the rest of mine.”🩵🩷🩵🩷

I also plan on having a funeral for Jordyn in the future, if I still have trouble with grieving. And that’s okay. They were loved, and still are.

We found my grandma dead this morning and I feel like it's all my fault,165,0.99,1710564194.0,"My mom, grandma and I live together. Last night I was cooking food around 11:30pm. I swore I heard a woman for a split second. It was high pitched and startled me and I took my pan off the stove and listened intently and heard nothing. I texted my mom and asked if she was making noise . Didn't get a response and went to my studio area . Didn't fall asleep. At 4 30am my mom frantically ran to me and told me to hurry quickly. She had found my grandma in her master bathroom on the ground and needed help turning her over . I turned her on her back and she was dead. 
Blood came out her nose and mouth. Mom was on the phone with 911 . Gave her CPR . And she was just gone. She had been gone, she was cold with no pulse. Unexpected and out of nowhere.
She was fine last night. 

I feel guilty. I had the thought to check on her when I heard that noise because it had me frightened it was so strange of a sound. But I didn't want to wake her up and it was storming. There's 3 dogs in the house . I assumed it was in my head and it could of been. There was no sign she fell and hit her head or anything like that . It seemed she was probably gone when she hit the floor. But in my head and heart I keep saying what if I had went in there ... if I had maybe my grandma would be here still. I hate myself right now .

My mother hung herself in the woods yesterday.,162,0.98,1691289332.0,"This doesn't feel real and I am going through throwing up and being in denial. My mother suffered from bipolar but was pretty good at masking it around people for most of my life. I just turned 33 and as her daughter I never expected she would be out of my life forever at this age. This year has been terrible because something triggered a 10 day manic episode in January where she basically burned every bridge. Once it was over she couldn't get over the shame and fell into a deep depression. She was hospitalized multiple times but could only seem to be kind of act functional for a week or so back at home and then get so depressed again that she wouldn't eat or sleep. 

She moved in with me and I really thought I could help her but it was a cycle of her acting somewhat hopeful to a deep depression. Yesterday we got into an argument because I found out she has been lying about taking her meds. We exchanged some words and she got into her car and sped away. I really didn't think much of it and thought maybe she just needed space. After too many hours went by, my sibling and I started blowing up her phone. 

I finally filed a missing persons report while hoping she just went to a hotel or something. This morning the doorbell rang with two officers holding their hats. I already knew what they were going to say but they said they were very sorry but they found her body and she hung herself. My brain isn't processing this at all.

I think I fucked up by being honest to my professor...,162,0.95,1691086609.0,"Basically I emailed him asking a simple question about my grade. He asked me why I took ""so long"" to email him about this, because I only saw the grades right now, but they got released two months ago.

In 2 small paragraphs and 4 sentences in total I very briefly explained to him that I got in a delirium today from my cat getting lost and spiraling into a depressive episode from being in a very stressful environment (basically my friends treating me like their therapist). I explained I have issues for which I am on my way to get properly medicated for which causes me, among other things, extreme anxiety to see my grades, and that I hadn't seen my grades in general in almost a year. Therefore, getting in a delirium and becoming deeply unstable and barely holding onto reality, I decided that that moment was the safest one for me to see my grades, because I'd get the least shock from being most detached from reality.

Of course he hasn't responded, I don't expect him to, but I'm scared I fucked up by telling the truth when the truth is... this. I find it difficult in general to lie, but especially in times when I lose control. I was even preparing to lie to him just in case he'd ask me something like this, but I knew I had nothing to back up my lie. And being upfront was kind of the only way for me to actually justify being so late in emailing, because that's just the reality.

I just want to get my degree with my own dignity... I hope I don't make these people hate me forever for being like this and thus stop me from receiving what I study so hard for...

Edit: Before I go to sleep I want to clarify 2 things. Number 1 is that I don't judge my professor at all for not responding to me, I would do the same in such fragile situation. Number 2 is that for me, none of the information I shared were things I ""hide"" from anybody casually (not in a professional setting of course if not prompted). There's a myriads of other things I hide, which are way more severe and unsettling to the average Joe. Sharing *those* things for me would be considered **for my own boundaries** as oversharing, simply because the information I shared is almost my entire life. I have nothing to say about my life if it's not that, which just covers the surface. Of course my definition of oversharing may be objectively wrong, but that's my personal definition of it. But besides the open ended conversation that is naturally unfolding, my main concern is about type of emotions this information could evoke to the other person, such as falsely making them believe I lied, making me look inappropriate to work in the industry, making me look difficult to work with, etc.",mentalhealth,the-fourth-planet,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15hbkih/i_think_i_fucked_up_by_being_honest_to_my/,41

They like to dig into your insecurities and even made me feel like I’m ugly, so I thought up a girl who doesn’t have those insecurities and was just all around beautiful and imagining what kind of life she would lead. The only one I’ll be going over in this post is “Sasha” which was a name I had liked due to being a big Bratz fan when I was younger and I had hated my name because it’s not very common and not only had an apostrophe, but also has a capital letter in the middle and was often made fun of. Since then, I have learned to love my name and switched her name to be mine. To better describe her and her life, she’s a beautiful dark skinned Afro-Latina woman who has long dark brown hair, she has an hourglass figure, and the most beautiful brown eyes in terms of looks and I often times will stay awake simply imagining her face and wanting to cry or scream. In terms of what she’s like, she has a very sweet personality, but she’s much more confident than me and takes crap from no one, she’s seen as the most perfect woman originally at school and later as an actress. She at some point got married to my dream man and they had kids who were practically the definition of perfection.

Now that I have in many ways made great strides toward recovery (or at least better coping mechanisms), I almost wish I hadn’t. Depression was comforting in a way. It filled some type of void. Now I look back at almost ten years of emptiness. I feel like dying would have been better because my life is like looking back on someone who was dead. I feel like my life is completely worthless. I understand that the sentiment that comparison is the thief of joy, but looking at the lives of others my age I don’t see the point. I feel like I will never have a full life, like I’ll always be behind. I’ve tried everything. This is one of the first times I’ve really allowed myself to process these feelings and it sucks but I do feel like I need to be honest with myself.

Poverty is quite common

Saddam added his image to all books and he persecuted turkmens

Urban areas are full of beggars

We have to read the whole book 200 pages and barely get anything out of it to become 'smarter' out of 1000 questions we memorize we only get 3% of those how useless

My father is exploited by the iraqi government and we can't even go back to our ancestral countries 

Any iraqis who are struggling seeing this i don't deny it because iraq is in bad condition socially 

Iraq has power cuts everyday and 6 times a day

The educational ministry brainwashed all turkic people here explains why they're patriotic 

Christians here aren't that persecuted but 2 governorates najaf and karbala persecute them and teach them their propaganda 

Iraqi conquerors killed 100000 central asian turks and raped 50000 and forced them to join the army and become arabs, this is also the reason why many iraqi turkmens support the siege of baghdad 

If you're wondering why us iraqi turkmens don't seem to be related to iranian turkmens is because we're iranian azeris

My turkic brothers are any of you here for me

I often feel negativity towards iraqis


The education here is VERY manipulative it explains why kids are patriotic

If you do not raise a iraqi flag during a mawtini performance then the school will beat you

I am 34 years old man. I have been there for people my whole life. Helping anyone in need. Emotionally supportive. Going above and beyond to help people who are at the lowest. I just want to see people happy and am willing to go to any lengths to make that happen.

"""Ugliness survey"" at the hospital exacerbated my body dysmorphia",155,0.98,1697972438.0,"I'm a 30 year old woman. I've struggled with body dysmorphia since childhood, mostly fixating on my nose (which has a bump and is crooked, so there is what you might call a ""real"" issue) as well as a general sort of ugliness that I cannot specifically place.   


This past summer I was hospitalized for anorexia and once I was transferred from inpatient to outpatient, they enrolled me in a few group therapies. One of the nurses in the program had me email her photos of my face from different angles and distributed these photos to ten anonymous staff members at the hospital, and asked them to answer questions like, ""How ugly is this person out of 10?"" or ""How much does this person's nose ruin their face?"" and so on. We wrote the questions together.  


Before she did this exposure I expressed multiple times that I feared I would be at risk of self-harming upon seeing the results, and that I really did not want to do it. I asked if I could opt out and she said yes but continued to bring it up and ask me why I wouldn't do it until I eventually agreed.   


The results came in and were varied. A couple people rated me a ""10"" for beauty, others a ""4."" More than half said that my nose does in fact ruin my face (ratings of 6-10 out of 10).   


These results were very distressing to me, less because of the numbers themselves and more so because I felt coerced into doing the exposure and because there was no follow up or after care. The nurse read me the results, gave me the ""raw data"" and excused me from her office. This was in July, it's mid-October now, and I am still struggling with this information.  


This is of course not the ""cause"" of my dysmorphia, but I'm feeling unable to get past what feels like confirmation of my ugliness. I have trouble leaving my apartment or working while my partner is home because I fear he will look at me and see how ugly I am. It is disrupting my every day. I am in therapy with a general counsellor and also a trauma therapist, so two sessions a week, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the BDD. I also research it and read studies and articles about the disorder to try to better understand it. I consider myself in most ways a very reasonable, giving, dedicated person, friend, and partner, but I am so totally fixated on my ugliness sometimes that I fear I will drive others away.  


I guess I am asking two things: 1. Is there any hope for dysmorphic patients? I haven't felt like I've made any progress over the 12 or so years of therapy, and 2. Is this kind of exposure experiment normal?  


Thanks very much in advance for any insight.

My dad was arrested for possessing pictures of kids,147,0.95,1707366364.0,"This is my first post on here but I need help

My dad was arrested a few years back and was found in possession of child pornography.

(Context)

My dad was a highly respected professional in the teaching field until he was arrested and charged with possession of CP. After discussions with himself, my family and the solicitor who fought his case, I have developed some understanding of the situation. Suffering from trauma in his childhood, he had been searching through dodgy forums etc. to see how these people interacted with one another, whilst simultaneously getting extremely drunk. It was obviously a stupid thing to do and I feel like I have to believe that what he is saying is true as I do want to trust him.

I think back to my childhood, going round to friends houses, seeing their parents not drinking and thinking that was strange. This was only because of the copious amounts of alcohol he would ingest of an evening, from whiskey, to vodka, to endless cans of beer. But growing up and seeing this, day in day out, made me believe that this type of consumption was normal. 

When I initially found out what happened, I had received a phone call off my dad explaining vaguely what the situation was and as soon as I put the phone down, I couldn’t stop crying and I came to the conclusion that I wanted to end my life. I had my note written and I was ready, but in the back of my mind all I could think about was how I would never see my family again - and I ended up calling Samaritans (who were amazing might I add).

Anyway, this was 3 years ago, he was given a suspended sentence and community service, and life as a family hasn’t been the same ever since. He still lives at home with my mum but whenever I go back home, there is just a feeling of constant sadness and all of the happiness that I used to feel around my family is a relic of the past. 

I suppose the question I want to ask is, how do I move on from this? Obviously I’ll always love him unconditionally, but everyday I just feel more and more resentment towards him for the situation he put us all in - losing contact with countless friends and family members, having to prevent him from meeting any of his grandkids, all the looks and comments you get, and I could go on all day.

I don’t want to cast him out but it feels like I’m constantly grieving my dad, fuck, sometimes I think it might’ve made things easier if I was actually grieving him.

I feel healthier at home and I just feel like my brain needs rest and a reset. It feels silly to call out because of this, but I *know* it’s something I need.

After that there were a few more instances but then we just acted like nothing ever happened. I dont even know if they remember. I hope they don't. I dont know who to talk to about this.

I don't wanna talk to my parents cause I'm worried they'll think I'm making it up, or I'll ruin my whole families relationships with each other, and ruin my relationship with my sister. 

I know it's not either of our faults, we were just kids and we didn't know any better, but that doesn't change the fact that it happened. I've tried hard to forget about it but I can't.

Going through a very rough time right now. I’m suffering from major anxiety and panic.

My boyfriend of 3 years has lost his patience I guess and is basically breaking up with me if I can’t provide him with enough sex. (We’re both in our 20’s looking to live together soon)

I was a victim of sexual assault/abuse as a teen and he knew this from the beginning of our relationship. We’ve always had issues with sex but some months are better and some are just kinda dry. 
He told me a week ago that he can’t sit around and wait til I get better and start controlling my sexuality anymore and I need to give him more intimacy and sex. 

I’m incredibly hurt. I’ve given him alternatives that don’t include me and I would even be open if he would satisfy his needs elsewhere. 
I really want to stay with him because I love him but my only way to save this relationship is to force myself into giving him more sex. We do it every one-two months or so. 

Is that really not enough? What am I doing wrong. My libido is extremely low and I have a lot of stress all the time. I’ve been trying to work on it for ages buying different sex toys and trying to get rid of my physical pain during sex too. 

I really thought he loved me for me and that he wouldn’t just leave me for a lack of intimacy… he’s not giving me more time unless I basically promise him I will get better and we will do it more often soon. I feel not enough. I feel unsafe and I feel let down. Will I ever be enough for him? 

What do I do… I’m heartbroken. I don’t know if I can save this relationship. I’m very desperate as I really love this man. ",mentalhealth,Poopie94,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b34vth/boyfriend_wants_to_break_up_with_me_if_i_dont/,249

Our sex life had problems because of her past experience, but after a while she enjoyed it a lot. You could say I opened her the wonders of the sex world. But during our relationship, the thought of that cop experience always stuck with me an made me sick. I get very frustrated and angry when I think about it and start too feel like I need to throw up.
Now that our relationship is over for about 3 months, i get even more sick by the thought of it.
I’m scared that she will go back for him just to have sex. I just hope it doesn’t happen.
Is this feeling I’m getting normal? Should I visit a therapist about it?

Thanks in advance!

Edit:
Thanks for all the support, but I owe some of you an more detailed explanation of the phrase “wonders of the sex life”. Yes I see it seems sketchy to say that. What I meant, was that she never experienced a partner who cared for her well being while having sex. Like taking it slow and listing to her body. She never had orgasms in the instances before or a sense of pleasure. 
And for all the people saying that she had different kinks and all that stuff. Later on we had our spicy adventures.

This world has no magic and it's unacceptable.,126,0.93,1710858294.0,"When I was young I found the cheap looking, plastic tiara and rod which advertised as it is for 'enchanted fairy, at discount store, and naive thought was going on. One day I read a novel about a family that can bring the force to shield evil magicians, hidden in remote place of mountainside. I was very into said book with scripture so I actually tried the babbles in the room for over hour while holding my breath, drew my whole force and willpower to do the 'chant and fantastically resulted nothing. Later I got the said fancy rod at mall and read the instruction, was so happy to summon a small friend with it But I realized there's no battery at home. And quickly realized that I have no money at pocket. Even worse it doesn't seem to make me a cute magic familiar.

""How this world is livable without magic..?

At this point, the only reason society wouldn't discard me is my age and perhaps gender. I imagine that if an older male shared my lifestyle and beliefs, he'd immediately be regarded as a loser/bottom of the barrel. You know what I'm talking about. The guy who lives in his mom's basement, unemployed and loveless.

I'm self-centered and selfish, hateful towards myself, yet not enough to change anything. I have no drive or self-discipline to do anything, I go along with whatever can make me forget my reality. My escapism techniques include, but not limited to: binge eating, maladaptive daydreaming, compulsive masturbation, using character AI, obsessing over media (hyperfixations, as I'm autistic too). I spend my days bedrotting.

I'm extremely paranoid, to the point of delusions, at least according to others. I fear that my family is spying on me/my devices. Which is a major source of constant anxiety, considering the kind of stuff I do. The only friend I had is just like me, with the exception that he was capable enough to get himself out of the hole I'm in. Secretly, I began hating him for it due to my jealousy. Our friendship was just him dragging me around while I complain. I'm glad he stopped contacting me - it's less humiliating that way.

And by reading this, you might get the impression I'm someone who had a difficult life. Not really. I used to be one of those 'gifted kids' that learned to read faster than everyone else, got praised, etc, etc. I was used to having everything handed to me on a silver platter, giving up immediately if things didn't go my way. I'm not self-sufficient, I learned how to do my laundry last week.

Every once in a while, I'll make an empty promise to improve. My addictions are a glaring issue but whenever I try to stop, I get reminded of how miserable I really am. I face reality and I can't handle it. I feel furious, anxious,  to the point of having panic attacks. Which leads me back into my vices again. It goes like this - 1. Spend a week bedrotting and indulging in my addictions.

2. What the fuck am I doing with myself? I could be doing something productive.

3. Make the smallest attempt at being present in my life, at fixing something, at existing.

4. ""Everyone's better than you, you're stupid, undisciplined, ungrateful, incapable, friendless, ugly, fat, etc. Why even try?""

5. \*cue breakdown\*

6. Rinse and repeat

I have a classmate who often tries to reach out to me, which I don't understand. She's hardworking, friendly, ambitious, an overall bright person. The complete opposite of me. I politely turn her down, because she doesn't know what she's messing with. I don't want to drag her down.

"My sister found out the hard way, that our mom is unreachable.",122,0.98,1686891111.0,"So my mom is a textbook narcissist- always the victim always everyone else’s fault she’s never to blame- she’s an angel. She also has this weird trait where the longer time goes by the more and more she manipulates reality in her mind- 1 documented example was when my sister told her she didn’t want to follow my moms path and get a masters in psychology because “It’s stupid and a waste? what have you done with your degree?” - which was/is true mom has a masters in psychology from a major university. So instead of just scolding my sister she parked in the store
parking lot across from her school- locked the doors and proceeded to beat the living shit out of her raking her forearms punching her face ripping chunks of her hair out…..all while her friend is in the back seat screaming…. she did so much damage in less than 2-3 mins the friend said- and then my mom just drove the 20-30secs to the school and dropped off my sister- told her go to class before you’re late- so of course an 11yr old walking into a school blood dripping from her arms patches of hair missing a swollen face drew some attention-Cps was called and we had bi weekly home visits
for 6 months-when my dad got home he was like”WTF vickie what did you do, my
god look what you did to our daughter” and my mom defiantly said “that little brat deserved it she was being disrespectful, and then proceeded to tell us how rude and disrespectful my sister was and how she deserved it” no empathy or apology-
then 6months later it morphed into self protection and minimizing what actually happened- 2 years later it morphed into something completely unrecognizable of the truth “Your sister was trying to yank the steering wheel into oncoming traffic i had to defend myself while fighting her off “

That’s just one story of the woman i’m talking about-So i’ve known for over a decade that anything coming out of her mouth is either a lie or a manipulation 99.9% not the truth or what actually happened.So for the life of me i don’t know why my sister believes the bullshit that comes out of her mouth sometimes. My sister is in vacation in our mother country and calls me telling me mom told
her a story about how dad would hit me and hit her-10000% false that man never laid a finger on any of us-the only thing he could be faulted with was not believing us and not divorcing her faster.He is the definition of a great loving father- everything she’s not. I fucked up and let the beans spill about how not only
did dad never hit us but mom sexually abused me -i’d wake up in the middle
of the night with her rubbing my feet the rubbing my thighs and i blanked out the rest- she would walk in on me showering -
pull the curtain open and then tell me
how the size of my peen compared to my dads…..about how the time mom made me file a false police report against our father saying he hit her or else i wouldn’t get to escape from her and spend a 4 day weekend at my friends(my dad was in oil&gas industry- being a 14yr old kid getting hit for flinching around her - i took every opportunity i could to escape from her- so i went along with her filed a false
police report and my mom almost got my dad fired from his prestigious job- the real reason was $- my dad had limited her access to their $ and she was pissed about it - wanted to get back at him. So i fucked up spilled the beans to my sister and now she’s so angry she wants to make my mom go to the police and file reports whenever she gets back from vacation- my sister now has a
degree of control over my mom
because she gives her 500$/month and pays her 12k/year property taxes. So i get a call from my mom crying and saying she’ll apologize for whatever she just can’t go to the police and go to jail- while part of me wants that, a friend who used to be a therapist told me “It’s like
you’re both living in the past with her” and i believe him- so putting aside the lies the bearings the S/a, i told my sister i feel it would be better if we just sought out professional help to work through this 20yr old trauma and just cut off contact with our mom, next time we see her should be at her funeral.
You can’t reason with a person like her who never sees herself as the aggressor as the demon as evil incarnate.
When i bring up this fact to my mom “How come 4/5 of us plus my sisters friends plus my friends-how come all these people remember reality one way and you’re the only one that remembers things the way you do? how come that’s the case? and she replied with” $ and your father’s brainwashing “ i laughed hung up and blocked her and told my sister i won’t be accompanying her to the police station- i want to seek therapy and move on with my life. My sister has ptsd and her brain just doesn’t remember a lot of these events me my dad and my other brother are cursed with remembering everything. There’s soooo much more i could put on about her- like specific scenarios where reality=A, and Her reality =ansisiehduehdwjsbsxhehwkdbdush

They are discharging her. Wtf is she that good at hiding shit or is psych at the hospital stupid. Shes texting me so she's been cleared by psych. She keeps saying I love you, and I just want to scream. Think a thick foam pillow would middle scream? 

the system fails again.  So tired of this I can't take care her mental needs. I just want to shut down I'm so stressed I'm hallucinating vividly. reality is weird. 

I still haven't slept probably won't till way later. 

Why do I even try to get her help when the medical system just doesn't care. 

The stray who I fed and let sleep on the porch came by severely injured. I will spare y'all the details. We have no money nor car for a vet.mil said to call animal control. He is an elderly at least 12 years old feral stray with no teeth. I highly doubt they will spend a dime to save him.

 It like when it rains it pours. That cat let me and only me pet him even though hes been here longer then me. We had a bond. He came home looking for help. I'm glad I was there to help him, he got right into the carrier I put outside to trap him so he didn't wander off. 

  I'm overwhelmed

 She yelled at the emts for not wearing masks in our house.  But she ended up going because the emts told her it wasn't optional the amount she took was considered a suicide attempt. She didn't even look at me as she left.

I know I did the right thing. I should have done it sooner.

OP

She tried to OD today she's only not in the hospital cause she threatened to leave me if I caused her to be in the psych ward again. But she took TWO huge according to her handfuls of her old lithium that for some reason didn't get thrown out. She says she did throw up about 20 minutes after taking them. So no idea how much actually got into her system.

I sat with her all day in her room and now we both have our bedroom doors open so we can hear each other and easily check on each other ,(our rooms are right next to each other we literally talk by simply talking loud) 

She won't go to the hospital I keep begging her. She has been dangerously suicidal for a year EVERY day she tells me in tears she wants to die. 
She says she will make an appt with a psychiatrist on Monday but she rarely ever keeps her psych appointments she always makes excuses even if it's a telehealth visit. Even if she does and they prescribe meds she won't take them. She will for a week and then stop saying they make her feel weird. I try explaining that that is normal and will go away but she would rather stop the meds entirely.

How can I help her get the help she needs? She says she isn't suicidal right now,but that's besides the pint she took a ton of lithium she needs to be monitored.
I'd prefer she go in the morning to the ER and from there the psych ward for medication management. She says she will take the meds if we go through scheduling on Monday but even so it could take months for her to get in to see someone psychiatrists are heavily booked in our area.

I'm scared I'm going to wake up and find her dead. She needs help asap and I'm not sure how to get her help without losing the relationship in the process.",mentalhealth,scelestai,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/14bnwvw/how_can_i_help_my_suicidal_wife_who_tried_to_od/,99

We were supposed to hang out that night with our group of friends, but we didn't get to do that. And surely, it makes no sense to me and it never will.  
  
Since I first got the news, sleeping and eating are hard for me. Coincidentally, she passed away on Holy Week (religious holiday here in Latin America, from Thursday to Sunday) so after the memorial, I couldn't stop playing for 10 hours straight. I had to force myself to sleep to stop playing. I'm lucky enough to have found two people on queue which I started playing with and they made me feel better about this situation.  
  
Since today (Monday after Holy Week) isn't a holiday anymore, I had to start working and studying again. It's extremely hard to go back to the 9-5 routine. I had so many activities before this whole thing and I feel like I can't do them. I can just play Valorant to stop thinking about it but of course, it's unhealthy for me. Whenever I'm not playing, I'm thinking of my friend and my heart sinks. So I choose to play to have a little bit of fun and forget about it for a second.  
  
I'm thinking about therapy, since I'm not used to talking about my feelings nor am I good expressing myself. I know right now Valorant is a coping mechanism of mine and I need to give myself time because it's all very recent. I just don't want to get addicted to it in order to neglect my feelings.

One Bad Trip Changed My Life,112,0.93,1707582759.0,"On October 1st 2013, I smoked some weed. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was laced with an unknown substance. I had a horrific experience. I may have been on the roof at one point. I was all alone, and I live in the middle of the woods, so no one knows what all actually happened. 

Well, a few weeks later, I ended up in the hospital for it. I acted deranged enough that they put me in the quiet room. I was only in the hospital for about a week or two, but I was forever fucked up by that experience. When they let me out, I had to stay with my grandparents because I couldn’t handle being at home for various reasons regarding details of the bad trip. 

During that time, I lost control of myself, and I very violently murdered a few of my family members, and I got put back in the hospital and back in the quiet room by myself.

Now, that last part never happened, but you can imagine how fucked up I was that I believed that I did that. And it still haunts me as if it actually happened because it felt so real. I can still feel my cousin’s little neck in my hands and the cracking it made when I killed him, even though it never happened. I can still see the horror on everyone’s faces as they tried to pin me down. I can still feel my back against the carpet as they held me and cried.

It took about a year, but I got a hold of myself, and I slowly started to be able to differentiate between my vivid imagination and reality again, and I haven’t had trouble with it since. But occasionally, I stop and I wonder if I am indeed still sitting in the quiet room, just imagining all of this.",mentalhealth,thewistfuldrifter,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ank7h9/one_bad_trip_changed_my_life/,43

The hatred and anger I feel about men now isn't healthy and I can't stop feeling this way. I watched my boyfriend be attacked from behind while he was in the bathroom and he was nearly blinded/killed. I had to throw myself between them as he had passed out. I was taking punches trying to keep his head protected because he had passed out while the men behind the bar and owner (who didnt hire a bouncer) just watched and shouted and didn't step in. It only stopped after he ran away and I was screaming for help. No one called the police or ambulance I had to call his dad to pick us up  After that incident I havent been able to sleep I got put on 5 pills by my psychiatrist to deal with the trauma and flashbacks. I have never went to a party/club and that was our 4th time out. Yesterday at new years the second time we have went out since the incident a man threatened me for moving a jacket, which I moved so I could sit down (it wasn't his, it wasn't mine, the guy who's jacket it was is up dancing he doesn't even know the guy) I wasn't about to sit on someone's jacket so shifted it up a bit so I could sit with my group. It was moved 5 inches and he had 2 seats of space ). I could feel my anxiety creep up after the threat and my boyfriend told him to calm down, there is no issue here and this man slid up behind me (he was 2 metres away) and started threatening my boyfriend telling him to meet him outside. My boyfriend rolled his eyes ignored him and just put his arm around me and kept talking to the group. At this point I was having flashbacks, I started having a bad panic attack, I couldn't breath, tears were streaming, I was gasping for breath. Boyfriend and his cousin noticed and got me outside so I could breathe where the bouncer came up to say he could understand where he was coming from since he was there first (I still have no clue how me not wanting to sit on a strangers jacket and moving it beside me so I wasn't on top of it is worthy of his behaviour) At this point I was just saying between gasps 'i dont actually care about that I'm just having ptsd I don't need this right now'    bouncer walked away and I was being calmed down between panic attacks. I woke up this morning with intense anger. I can't let it go. IV had enough of grown men not being able to control themselves and being violent over something a simple as a jacket that wasn't even his or someone he knows.

It's consuming my every thought and I start shaking in anger over my disgust with men.

ESPECIALLY when she uses her sweet, innocent 4yo sister as her main scapegoat...

I am in a perpetual state of anger, defensiveness, sadness, resentment, shame, self-loathing, and dread. 

I can't keep existing this way...

__________________________________________
**EDITED TO ADD CONTEXT**

My daughter is 13yo.  She has been struggling with ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder), ADHD, and HFA since she we put the pieces together when she was about 3.5yo.

The main issue is her ODD.  If you're not familiar with ODD first-hand, it's really hard to understand the full scope.  She has 3-7 SCREAMING tantrums throughout the course of any normal day.  These typically last a minimum of 20 minutes to upwards of 90 minutes.  Not a single syllable of that is exaggerated.  They will start over simple things like me asking her if she washed her hands before making lunch, her refusing to figure out how to solve simple problems (ex: there's clothes in the dryer and she needs to switch her clothes over), or getting caught in a lie (ex: I can see from the security camera that she did X and she will scream and get violent trying to lie about it).  Before we started homeschooling, we were getting phone calls to pick her up at least 2, if not 3, times per week because she was being violent with the teachers and disruptive of the learning environment.  

These are all very literal, real examples. These literally happen every day... since she was 3yo.

We have done ALL the things... psychiatrist, in-home therapist, special needs program at school, different pediatricians, school social workers, read the books, tried the tactics.  We have heard from no less than a dozen professionals ""wow, you're doing all of the things we typically suggest"" -- but nothing works!  (And I'm Sicilian, so discipline is not lost on me.)

You can imagine the toll this takes on our family life when so much time and effort is put into ending her tantrums so we can do things and go places, including canceling vacations, not attending family events, etc.  For the past 1.5yrs, she's started to get really jealous of her little sister (who is currently 4yo) and she is now her scapegoat.  The added stress of having to protect my innocent, sweet little girl from someone she worships is too much.

The resentment comes from how much emotional energy, time, and money we've put into trying to help her over the past decade+ since we isolated the diagnoses with NO return or no change and, if anything, escalating behaviors as the teen 'tude sets in.  It's like living in an emotional warzone and I would be struggling even if I weren't also BPD and struggling on my own.

Hope that clarifies for the people who were asking about discipline, where the resentment comes from, etc.",mentalhealth,Complete-Scar-2077,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15bg64h/my_kid_is_my_main_bpd_trigger_and_i_cant_handle/,120

My mom claims she has thousands of bugs crawling on her,107,0.99,1707336011.0,"I don’t know what to do anymore. My mom 54 years old has been convinced for the last 3 months that she has scabies, or mite infestations. I want to let it known that just over a year ago she was in the hospital for three weeks due to a nervous breakdown. She was having “shakes” and “shocks”, the doctors could never figure out was wrong. 

Life was okay for a couple of months after she got better she was off work for 8 months. She went back to work 4 months ago when all of this started. She started telling our house that the animals had fleas, which then turned into mites. She bought medication for all our animals and claimed the were more free.( even with no evidence whatsoever they even had them to begin with)

About a month later she started telling us that she thinks there’s mites on the furniture. She cleaned the whole house, along with all the furniture and starting making homemade sprays to kill the “mites”. 

About a week later she told my dad that she has scabies. She said she found a rash on herself and that she knows it scabies. Instead of going to our family doctor she called a over the phone clinic where she spoke to someone over the phone who said they recommended scabies cream. She then proceeded to buy said cream and use it. She bought it again and used it again. She now uses scabies cream every week. She has these hives in her body, she’s been putting lotion all over her body along with tea tree oil and homemade mixers as well. She also took all the furniture out of her bedroom, along with clothes and anything really. She then took all the couches out of the living room. Claiming they were infested. 

She refuses to go see a dermatologist, or have an ink test done or a scratch test for mites. She has 4 showers a day boiling hot, along with doing her bedding two times a day. Every time she naps she washes them. She has spent about 3 thousand dollars on mattress covers and new clothes. For the first couple of weeks my dad was supportive and helping her. We all put in this cream to help ease her mind. There’s 4 people living in our house. 

Fast forward 2 months and my mother is very un hinged. I’m feeling extremely uncomfortable living with her. She’s constantly picking at her skin and picking at her bed claiming any little piece of dirt she mites is a mite. She’s even been in my room along with my nans looking at our beds for “ evidence “.

I’m currently looking for a place of my own since I simply can’t handle her anymore. I don’t know what to do and neither does my dad. He’s been supporting her, and trying to understand. But now I feel like someone needs to do something. I’ve heard of Delusional parasitosis, and so far everything I’ve been reading sounds just like what’s been happening to her. 

Today I caught her picking at her skin along with putting a whole bottle of tea tree oil in her hair. She has hives on her neck, as she keeps scratching and picking. She pops the bites on her head claiming she can feel thousands of babies all over her whenever she does this. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. As I fear I’m getting more and more worried about her mental health, she’s starting to scare me. I want to be there and support her but I also don’t want to be an enabler. 

It’s hard to talk to my dad about this, as he claims that we should just let her medicate and use the lotion and hopefully they will go away if she will relax. He’s not really helping the situation. It’s also important to note that my mom does use marijuana, and it’s on anxiety and depression, medication, as well as sleep medication. 

I need help on what to do. 

Any suggestions would be helpful.

I was sexually abused when I was 10 by my mother's younger brother and my parents didn't do anything about it. ,107,0.99,1711374920.0,"I was 10 and I visited his house with my mother that winter. We were in their bedroom and having dinner on the floor (his wife, my mom and me). He was on the bed, under a blanket, watching TV. All of a sudden, he calls me to get under the blanket. I didn't want to go but my mom pushed me to go. Then my mom and aunt left the room to do the dishes downstairs. He switched the channel to a religious one where holy songs were being played. Then he proceeded to molest me. He hugged me tightly, tried to kiss my lips, then ran his hands all over my body. I could feel his penis against me. Then he slided in his hands under my clothes and rubbed my private parts. I don't know why I couldn't leave the moment he started touching me inappropriately. I just laid there like a corpse. The trance broke when I heard my cousin come back downstairs. I told him that I needed to go and left. I couldn't speak about this to anybody for the fear of broken relationships. I had to share the house with that monster for the next couple of days. I started developing severe anxiety right after that incident and still hasn't gone away. Although I never spoke to him after that incident, I had to be in the same vicinity because of our familial ties. And it was deeply uncomfortable but I kept shut. 
After 12 years of this, I revealed it to my mother in a fit of rage and she blamed me for not revealing it to her earlier. Her stance was clear that she couldn't do anything about it because it was too late, and it's difficult to pick between your child and your sibling. I was shocked beyond anything by this. When I shared this with my dad after a while, he assured me plainly on the surface and moved on. He continues to share a good relationship with that man, so does my mother. But anytime I bring this up, they try their best to make it seem like it's not a big deal and I should move on because it has been too long. Who is going to make them understand that I haven't been able to process this incident and it ruined what was left of my childhood.

I got fired for my mental health today,106,0.94,1686262690.0,"So I got fired today, they’re reasoning was that I had “To many emotional outbursts and was distracting to the trainer and the other class members”. 

Some context, I was in a 9 week training period for a job. I was doing all the work and was one of the top members in my training group when it came to attendance, performance and scores. This class did not come without it’s bumps, we started out with 18 and by week three had 11 due to one particular student who could not grasp the concept of the job we where training for. And when she was told she was wrong she would get verbal and at on point physical. And then we went down too 8 as some drama happened between certain class members and one quit while one got fired. 

Now onto me, these class rooms where small and the noise would echo. I get overstimulated as I have extreme anxiety and depression which I’m medicated for but recently the medications haven’t been working. I just got insurance so I was planning on seeing a therapist but until then I was pushing on like a normal human. I had a few times where the overstimulation made me cry so I removed myself for a couple of minutes with the teachers permission and then I would return. I had a panic attack one day as one of the class mates got mad and yelled in my face triggering a episode. But again I removed myself from the room, spoke with the teacher who said I was fine and returned to class. Everyones performance stayed the same and the duties we where doing did not get affected. When they sent me home telling me they where investigating if they wanted to keep me employed I explained my medical condition.

30 minutes and happy birthday to me! 🎂,102,0.99,1683171014.0,"I didn’t think I’d be around for this long, I made a promise to my friend when I was healing and becoming clean and that helped wonders- 4 years ago and now I’m slowly learning to establish boundaries. I’m learning more about myself than I’ve ever before. My parents tell me I’ve wasted time, useless, can’t be helped and why I passed off so much. But looking back from the progress of where I came from to now, I’ve grown tremendously and beautifully- I’ve changed as a person for the better and I’m not in a self destructive state with a better mental health, attempted eating habits, and knowing my limits and self care despite maybe needing asd diagnosis test and an adhd one. 

I now know not to put myself through self sacrifice to help others due to parental trauma and I’ve learned not to beg for love that’ll never return to me from my parents but that’s still a work in process. I’ll eventually seek therapy again for my health but for the time being, I am proud to say- I’m turning into an adult soon. I had matured too early due to absent parenting but that will heal someday. That concludes everything, my promise to not self destruct to my friend ends tonight but I’ll always keep that promise to my heart for the rest of my life.

Is it possible that you get dumber after being in a long period of acute depression/bad mental state?,101,1.0,1693918684.0,"(I apologize for the wording of the question and the choice of words that I made in the post)

I went through a period where I was at an all times low in my life in every way imaginable. For 2 years straight I suffered so badly from depression that I had to quit my job, and university, I shunned all my friends and fought constantly with my family, and my physical health declined so badly that I am battling level 1 hypertension and have gone half bald at 24. It led me to attempt to end my life 4 times and I had (what I assume to be) multiple episodes of psychosis. I am now in a relatively better place (I am back in university and am becoming social slowly). The problem is, I can't do any of the things I used to do.

I used to be great with art, I drew, painted, wrote in my spare time, and even worked as a fashion designer. Now I can't draw a straight line to save my life. I also used to love to go on hikes, ride my bike, and go swimming. I can't do any of it, despite being trained and playing in my school's swimming team from when I was 8 until I was 16.

One of my friends has a history of battling depression and anxiety (and have attempted multiple time in the past). She also lost some function until she started going to a psychiatrist and therapist. I didn't have professional help and tried therapy for months but it didn't do much.

With that being said, what's your experience with regression after depression? Do you think people get ""dumber"" or lose mental/motor functions after being in a long period of depression? Or is that limited to the ones that don't receive professional help? Is it possible to gain back those skills as good as they were by pushing through the mental block?

No one really talks to me unless they have to (ie. They only want something). People at my job can just talk to others like its just a normal thing, where I can't even get anyone to talk to me.

The statistics for middle age men who unalive themselves are pretty high, and for them who have gone through so much shit up until that point its quite obvious why. People like myself who are introverted with little to no social skills and live a life with little to no social interactions really don't have that much to live for. And for people who say its not too late to learn such skills at a latet age, while true but knowing you will forever play catch up just makes life completely discouraging.

Yeah my wife wants to leave me,95,0.98,1682064717.0,"I found a letter she wrote that she intended to give to me tomorrow. I was by myself, alone and my house. My wife had left for something I wasn’t invited to and I happened across the letter. 

Basically the whole thing boils down to she thinks I’m unhappy in our marriage, she says she’s unhappy with our marriage and wants to begin the process for divorce.

This shattered me to a million pieces.lately I’ve been dealing with more stress and anxiety than I ever have and finding that letter broke me.

I told her I found the letter and I had left one of my own explaining the mental health issues I’ve been dealing with, apologizing for her being drawn into it and for all the times I tried to cope in an unhealthy way.

my wife is going to tell me she wants a divorce. I do not want a divorce.

Tomorrow is going to be an extremely difficult day for me  (or today at this point by now)

I’ve seen the writing on the wall, I haven’t been the husband she deserves for a multitude of reasons but, she’s been the wife I’ve needed to keep me under control.

I don’t want to lose my wife. I wrote a letter for her explaining in excruciating detail that I’ve been dealing with mental health issues that have otherwise left me failing as a proper husband and consistently letting her down and breaking promises (not in spite of her) 

I know what’s coming and I dread it more than anything I ever have before. Tomorrow is judgement day it would seem and I’m worried about how I’m going to manage without her should she ultimately decide to leave.

I have no intention of forcing her to stay in a marriage she is unhappy in, I just feel like we’ve never really tried to make things work and I want to at the very least try.

We’re going to talk tomorrow about how we are going to proceed and I really just need some support.

I don’t know what her absolute decision will be but based on what I read, she has been done with this marriage for long time

I still love her, she is the only reason I have a degree and a job related to the degree I obtained.

This past March was our 5th year wedding anniversary, I did not anticipate that it could be our last. 

I’ve been stuck in a dark place for the past few weeks and I don’t want to lose my wife.

She seems to think we’ve been living a loveless marriage, which I will accept blame for not fulfilling my end of the intimacy aspect of the relationship. I don’t meant to imply this is entirely my fault however I do accept that in my imperfect actions as a husband also contributed to this situation.

My wife seems to think I don’t love her. I do, more than I could ever explain.

I travel frequently for work and I feel like this has not only contributed to the strife in my marriage but also driven me to the brink of insanity.

I took the job because it was the best offer after I a graduated and I thought it would be in both of our interests for me to take it as it was a significant pay increase compared to what I was making. (I did not make this decision without her)

I think this job has contributed to the downfall of the relationship between my wife and myself.

These next few days are going to be very hard for me, I feel like I’ve matured 10 years over the span of a week, the stress and anxiety have been unbearable. 

I don’t want to lose my wife, she is the light in my life but, I’m not going to try to force her to stay in a marriage that she does not think she can be happy in.

It’s rough, guys and I am not looking forward to our conversation but, I need to find closure one way or the other or I’m going to lose my mind.



***********************UPDATE************************

I have just reopened Reddit since posting this. There are a lot of comments and I will get around to answering those of you I am able to as I am able to.

Just as a little general answer as to how things are at the moment: 

I’ve found peace in this situation and have been preparing myself for whatever the final outcome of my marriage is.

I’ve been staying with my parents for a week, I’ve been getting counseling, I was started in an antidepressant and right now I’m going through the wonderful effects that starting an antidepressant brings.

My wife and I are separating for a year, she is taking our dog and will be living in Iowa with her grandmother for the next year until she has to return for school.

I feel like I’m starting to come out of a lifetime of being on autopilot and feel hope for my future for the first time in years.

That’s all I can think of for now, heads a little fuzzy because of antidepressant but overall mental health is looking up at the moment.

I was sexually abused as a boy,94,0.97,1699495741.0,"Well, that's the first time I talk about it at all. I'm 20 now and I suffered abuse since I cannot remember until I was 11. It took a long time to realize what happened to me was wrong and a longer time to realize I was not the wrong side. Until this, how I say, my mind was a straight up hell.

&#x200B;

I was a shy and isolated child. I actually talked a lot with my close ones, but introvert at all, nothing wrong. I remember when I was around 5, my grandmother told me to lie down with her in the bed. I refused at first, but she insisted so much that I accepted. She then started to talk about things involving sexual organs and how it was important to me to know the female body(remembering, I was 5). She asked me if I had ever seen a woman naked, so I told something like ""I've taken showers with my cousin(my age, call her 'Ana')"". Then she literally pulled down her pants and asked me to touch it, to ""know how it is"". I remember feeling very embarrassed and uncomfortable, and she said something like ""you have not to feel any wrong with this, it's like your cousin, but bigger"". Fucked up.

&#x200B;

Later, when I was 7-8, I was pretty often in her house, since my parents worked the whole day. So I often ate, took showers and slept there. Just to say, Some nights I couldn't sleep because that bedroom made me terrified(I actually didn't know why at this time). My younger brother and cousin(male) also were often there. At this age, she put us together in bath and, honestly, nothing inappropriated ever happened during these times. For some reason, the disturbing things happened only when we were alone, and she developed some creepy obsession with me, I will explain later.

&#x200B;

She had one of those electric massage tools, you know. She liked to massage my body with that, and I liked it in the beggining. She massaged my shouders, arms and feet, and that felt really good. But with time, she started to spend more and more time putting that thing over my chest and legs, until she put it over my genitals. I think that was my first orgasm, because the feeling was so intense and unexpected(also my body was probably aroused by the preliminary contact, but I couldn't know what is was). I had never experienced an erection at this time, but even so my genitals were ""wet"" when I went to bathroom. She made it more times, but not so intense, she kinda passed the tool around my legs and stomach and sometimes put it over the genitals, for a little time. She always told me I was her favourite grandchild, the most handsome, and other kinds of praises that made me feel disgusting.

&#x200B;

Sadly, the signs of abuse started to appear at that time. I became more introvert in school and, sometimes, I really froze when talking to people, and couldn't make many friends. I became aroused too. I felt I had the need of masturbate, not periodically because it felt good, but almost every day led by pure anxiety and that felling that it's the only way you were taught to do. fortunately, I never extended this to other people, but always kept it to myself(actually it fucked my mental health, but I honestly prefer this than become an abuser and victimizing and hurt other people). I remember taking baths with my cousin(yeah, that one I told in the bed) at my 9-10 and I never made any sexual play or talk with her. I only had a bit of curiosity about her vagina(also she about my penis), but those thoughts faded away when we started playing of throwing water at each other and make silly beards with foam. Those are actually good memories, which is kinda ironical in my opinion.

&#x200B;

So I hit puberty. I was 11 and, for privacy reasons, I told her I didn't want to take my baths with cousins or brothers. Anyways, she was until in the bedroom(there were a bedroom and bathroom, no door between them) and it was not a problem at all, I've taken many baths with she watching before. One day, After I finished the bath, I got up to shower the foam off and asked her for the towel. I always made this, but that time, well, I had an erection. Not first time, but first in front of someone. Well, she basically touched me very inapropriately, not going to give details here.

&#x200B;

I took baths there only a few times more, until I stopped totally to go there and stayed alone in home. In these days before I took this decision, her obsession about me and my body became sick. when I was in the bathroom, she started to massage my body and making awful comments about my penis. Yeah, some sick things like ""how can something be so thick, do you do exercises for it to grow?"", ""the girls will be crazy when you put this in front of them"" and ""your girlfriend will be a very happy girl with this"". Sorry for the girls reading this. Uh, my parts are actually very normal, and it's not a problem to me. I really care way more about feelings and caring than the body, and I'm pretty sure I could only stay with a girl if she felt the same. But now I know that she was doing had never to do with caring or increasing my self steem, but some distrubing way to catch me psychologically.

&#x200B;

Still in this bath part, she touched me very times, in the whole body. One day she took my phone that I had left in my pants and started reading my personal messages. There was really nothing I should be worried about, but it made me very uncomfortable too. Another day, after I took my clothes off, she said me to wait because she wanted to take a bath first. So she undressed in front of me and I obviously had an erection. She didn't touch me but I could see by her face that she was very satisfied producing that. That day was the more disturbing. After she finished, she told me to get in(She got out and dressed first, fortunately) and take my turn. I did, and when I get out, she told me to lie down in the bed, because she had noticed I had ""a rash on my inner thighs"" and she needed to see it. I honestly cannot describe what I was feeling. A mix of anxiety, fear, and somehow, arousal. When she pulled my towel off, I had a full erection. She put an oinment in my thighs and then started with that twisted comments about my body, penis and girls. So she put an oil in her hands and started, you know what. It may feel disturbing, but she moved her hands so passionately over my testicles and penis that it really looked like she was pleasing herself. I knew I should stop that, I should run away and tell someone, but at that time I felt so, uh, horny maybe, that I just couldn't stop it. I feel it extremely disgusting, but I think whoever experienced an orgasm knows exactly what I'm talking about. Well, then I came in her hands and that was the last time I went there.

&#x200B;

The last part was the worst of all, no doubts. I was in later middle school and I had always got the best grades in every subject, but my grades ""suddenly"" decreased to hell. To worsen the situation, my math teacher was very harsh and blamed me everytime for getting bad grades. I stopped doing things I liked before and lost 30kg (66 pound) in a very short time. I got also kind of addicted to porn, since it was the only thing that could distract me even for a few minutes. The rest of the time was pure torment in my head. I also had nocturnal panic and some weird things like imagining that there were demons or monsters in my bedroom. My family is evangelical, and it didn't help me much. Everytime I went to the church, I could feel anything but shame and guilt, feeling as I was not worth of being there. And, since I had not friends or someone I could trust to open myself, I always ended up believing those thoughs were true.

&#x200B;

When I was to get into middle school, I moved to other school. It's not necessary to say that my mind was not healthy and I couldn't make lasting relationship bonds. I was getting good grades again, but no one of my friends of that time remains close to me today, except by that cousin, Ana, who studied with me in high school. We had a good friendship, and our talks are almost always about music, school and politics. Since we are relatives and were very close in childhood, she felt ok to talk about sex with me sometimes, but always in a respectful way. Her concerns were most about having sex before marriage, and I said her if she wanted to be with her boyfriend for life and both felt ok with that, it shouldn't there be any problem(she's with the same guy until today and they are happy, I feel really glad for her). Today she's in 2nd year to become a psychologist. Sometimes I think about talking these things with her, but I really don't feel secure to open up.

&#x200B;

In my last year in middle school, I got really depressed. I lost my will to live and have a future, I didn't got into college and abandoned all my social circle. The only thing I did in this time was work, go to church and sleep. Despite my shame feelings never left, I always prayed to God to help me, at least, don't give up on everything. I think I'm doing well actually. 

&#x200B;

In my 19, I took my drive license. I thought I wouldn't be able to do it, due to my high anxiety level and a almost constant headache I have, but I did and I drive pretty well. I am also going to do exams to get into a college the next week. I'm not full confident that I will pass but I promised to not desperate and try again next year if I fail. I also found a girl that became one of the most important parts of my life. We are not in love yet, but I can feel she likes me the same way I like her. She laughs at all my jokes and pay attention when I'm talking, and it really makes a great difference. I don't struggle with thoughts like ""if I had found someone like her before I could have avoided a lot of suffering"" because I know that find someone like her is very rare and, anyways, she turns my days way lighter and brighter, and hard things have become easier to do. My greatest fear was how my body would react when we got close. I'm not talking about sex, and I don't want to think about it until the marriage(we're both evangelicals so it's ok), but normal physical contact. Fortunately, I discovered that I like her touch, and stay close feels very confortable, like the opposite I used to feel. I'm not gonna lie, I still have nightmares, flashbacks and panic, I still struggle with porn sometimes(very very few times, but when it happens I feel like those days), but I'm doing my best. When I feel depressed, it's like the time around me had stopped and I don't have forces to do anything, but I'm taking less time to recover than in other times. I've made good friends in the church and work, and the familiy of my girl is like a second family for me. Well, today my life is divided by fews days when I feel absolutely hopeless and some days when I have force, even feeling bad, shameful and empty I can do my best to have a future when I'll be free of this.

&#x200B;

PS: if someone is worried about my brother and cousins, they are all well. I really don't believe they went through this things, I've always kept an eye over all of them to not let the same thing that happened to me happen to them, and they are all ok, both physical and mentally.

How to break contact with suicidal friend?,90,0.97,1687632731.0,"I (23F) met Anna (19F) in a psychiatric hospital six months ago.

I told her to go back to the hospital, she finally did a month ago but left after a few weeks. Today she texted me saying she was afraid she her father would die because she put a bunch of painkillers into his drink after he got physical in a fight and now he was out cold. I begged her to call an ambulance. I didn't know what to do, if i called them and told the truth she would probably get arrestes. Finally i got her to call an ambulance, and her dad is okay, she didn't put too much. But the fear i was in while i was waiting for her to text back was terrible.

My landlord doesn’t care if I can’t pay rent because I can’t keep a job when my stress and anxiety make me miss too many days.

The government worker doesn’t care if I can’t qualify for assistance. I’m just another number in their system.

The judge didn’t care when I went in front of them to try to get disability. My condition wasn’t visible enough to match the information from my doctors.

My friends didn’t care if I couldn’t handle socializing for long periods of time. They just moved on. 

My partner doesn’t care if I can’t work up what’s needed to do the dishes today. They need to get done.

I berated myself for not being where I wanted to be. I blamed myself for every single failure, and couldn't see a way out. I pretended, I masked, until I allowed it to continue spiralling to this point. I spent months in utter silence, rejecting any support thrown my way.  

Today, an academic advisor from my university did not show up to a very important meeting which I barely managed to fit in before my deadline. I was at a breaking point, feeling that I somehow just needed to summon every last bit of energy in myself to deal with the irritating and never-ending minute problems of every single day. All these minute things had become far more important than anything else.

So, this happy, queer, and relatably autistic and disorganised man I already vaguely knew took me in instead. I'd seen him before, he had forgotten something he needed to submit from me, some silly admin thing. We had laughed about the fact that two severely ADD people would forget about this tiny thing months and months on end, having the same conversation every 6 months when the dread would pop back in our minds. 

Today, he took me in. Nonchalantly, the busiest man I know just went ""Since you're already here, come in! No problem."" 

He not only heard me, but he told me exactly what I needed to hear, and he probably has absolutely no idea. I know he saw me. He never blamed me, he never made me feel ashamed of myself. In the few minutes after he had noticed that I was sitting outside an empty office with my advisor missing, he already went to find all information he could on me so that he could give me the best advice. He told me I mattered, he told me I belonged, and he gave me the one thing I felt I had lost; he reminded me that I do have control over my life. I can decide where I go. It doesn't matter that my path doesn't look the way I thought it 'should' (whatever that means), and that it doesn't look the way my peers' do. 

Leaving that office, after a mere thirty minute conversation with him, I walked 2 hours before coming home, before sitting and writing a thank you to him, and before realising that he had just saved my life. 

You have nothing to lose by knocking on doors when you need it. Do not underestimate what help can do for you, no matter the scale of it. That's it; this nice friendly academic advisor.

I can't stop thinking about my brother,89,0.97,1699407085.0,"Hi everyone.  
What I’m about to write will probably be super confusing, disgusting, and weird. But, I have no one I can tell and so, I’m here on Reddit telling strangers. 

  
My(21) brother(19) is always doing explicit sexual things in front of me. Not entirely explicit, but explicit enough. He likes to go around the house naked. He comes in my room and stands by my bed and waves his dick at me. He asks me if I want to suck it. He comes in my room in the morning with morningwood and in his underwear. At random times, he’ll come in my room gully dressed, but grabbing is crotch and asking me to stroke it through his jeans. He always comments on my body and always tries and sometimes does grab my butt. He says, word for word “You have such a fucking juicy ass” “Get on the bed” “I’m gonna fuck you”. He moans our names and will randomly be sitting their and moans “oh oh I’m gonna cum”.

  
There’s so much more but in the moment I can’t remember.

  
Now I know, the simple solution to this would be to lock my door. But he will break down my door.   
Or I could tell my parents, but they already know and they don’t care. They say “he’s crazy, there’s nothing we can do about it”. They don’t understand that my brothers actions are effecting me mentally. Another solution would be for me to move out. But, I love my mom and if I left, my dad and his family would emotionally and mentally abuse my mom. Which is not something I would like. However this is probably what I will do in the near future.

  
I’m not here really looking for a solution though. Especially since I do plan on moving out in a year after saving some more money. I’m here just to put how I feel into words, especially in regards to how it is effecting me. I didn’t realize just how badly my brother doing this was a effecting me until recently. I’m an avid romance novel reader. However, I can not get through the romantic/explicit scenes in books anymore. My brother keeps popping up in my mind and I immediately have to close the book. I can’t even masturbate without his image. And it turns me off. I don’t think I can even have someone touch me or hear sexual words without my brothers face coming in my mind. 

  
It’s killing me on the inside and I don’t know what to do. It’s disgusting and I’m trying so hard to block it out, but I can’t. I just want to have fun, live life, read a damn romance book in peace, but I can’t.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that I am female, as some people are wondering. Also, it seems like people think that this post is some sort of incest porn fantasy. Which to me, sounds outrageous and honestly pretty hurtful and it seems like people are trying to invalidate what goes on in my life. But this is my reality.

"My therapist made a racial comment. Im desperate for therapy, but think I should cut her loose. Am I overreacting?",85,0.92,1711563973.0,"I just started therapy again, and have had 3 sessions with a therapist. I am a Black female and my therapist is a Black female.

We were discussing something related to germs. I can sometimes be “overly clean” and a bit of a “clean freak” which sometimes crosses the line into unhealthy and causes me anxiety. 

My fiancé is a white male. And although I don’t recall exactly what was said before my therapist  made the racial comment, I think i was   talking to her about how when we go to our Friends’ houses I often get picky about what I eat, drink out of etc.

Anyway, I forget what was said directly before she made this statement, but at one point my therapist said:  “Well, you know White people can be a little …..” . And  either she finished the sentence with “not that clean” OR, she made a face suggesting unclean. I honestly can’t remember, but her tone and body language made it very clear what she was suggesting. She was assuming it was a white person’s house and was essentially saying “Well maybe you being picky about those things is justified since white people can be a little nasty.” 

People are very comfortable talking to me, and in this case I think she got waaaaay too comfortable and slipped and shared this thought/bias like I’m just one of her friends.

I honestly  don’t think she is racist or meant any harm, BUT the comment was troublesome(for my reasons below) and I don’t think I want to work with her anymore. But I really need therapy. Should I stay or get on the hunt for someone else? 

 My issues:

Traumatized by being tasered and handcuffed by police during wellness check,83,0.96,1685021736.0,"Has anyone else ever been apprehended by police or had force used on them during a mental health situation and if if you have how do you cope with it? If you haven’t, what do you think about this and would you cope?

So a few months ago I called 911 because I felt like self harming. First I actually called something called here 24/7 which a mental health hotline and they told me if I want to self harm then I should probably call the police. 

My partner was with me and called with me and we both told the 911 dispatch I was feeling like self harming and I had a small kitchen knife to my thigh but I didn’t cut yet.

I told the 911 dispatch I was afraid the police would hurt me because I know they are aggressive sometimes and I work for the newspaper so I hear about what happens. She reassured me that are coming to “help” and I’ve had the police called by neighbours for arguments between my bf and I before and usually they’ve somewhat helpful, one time they even brought a mental health counsellor so I thought it would be like that. I just wanted some intervention to help me get out of that crazy head space.

So when the police came barging in they were screaming drop the knife (I was holding it to my leg lol) and I said no ONCE before I could even look up they tasered me. They had a riot shield, a gun and a taser pointed me at me when they came barging in screaming at me. Mind you, this is Canada.

The police officer who tasered me kept apologizing and saying to my bf “my friend just died like this and I panicked” or some shit. Like wow. The female cop there and the EMS told me there is usually a lot of deescalation tactics before that like they try to talk you down and stuff but they didn’t and they usually ever use force if they feel in danger. They told me to file a report against them because it was  very abnormal and they felt sorry for me. Imagine. 

They told me to and my mom told me to file a report and even get a lawyer because guess what when I got to the hospital they told me the police wrote on the report I said I “wanted to die by suicide by police” like yoooo I said the complete opposite to the dispatcher!!! I was AFRAID of them hurting me. I would never ever say something so foolish and I am NOT suicidal. So, they told me I should clear my name because it’s not safe or good at all to have that on my file and next time something happens they’ll be even more aggressive.

But I didn’t wanna relive the trauma so I didn’t (stupid) and fast forward to this week a neighbour called cause my bf and I got into a huge fight and I had a mark on my head cause I self harmed by hitting my head against the wall. They asked me and him if I was suicidal and we both said no not at all. They didn’t even ask me to go with them in the ambulance like usual for the mandatory mental health check, the paramedics came and asked me if I wanted to get my HEAD looked at and I said no. The police said ONCE “you’re going to the hospital for a check” and I was holding my cat in my arms and said “I don’t want to though” once and they literally attacked me so fast twisted my arms so aggressively and handcuffed me. I was crying yelling like WTF I WILL GO VOLUNTARILY U DONT NEED TO HANDCUFF ME UR HURTING ME. It was horrible they hurt me so much and dragged me like an animal when I kept saying unhandcuff me I will go voluntarily….if I had known they were gonna do that I obviously would’ve just went. Why would I want to be handcuffed and treated like that? I’m not that crazy.

I was at the hospital for 10 hours alone with no phone waiting to be discharged bc there was only 1 ER doctor and my bf “couldn’t handle being there and needed space” or some shit.

I *think* I have trauma due to movies my father puts on,87,0.83,1709698310.0,"TRIGGER WARNING: MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FEARS 

I don’t want to use the word trauma incorrectly but I said it because I feel like I have symptoms of it.

The story is that since I was around 12, my dad would put on movies that involved women being sexually assaulted and abused. They bothered me but they didn’t horrify me as much as when I was 16. That year my dad put on two movies called “Hollow Man” and “Sleepers” which are also movies that also featured sexual assault but for some reason these movies made me cry the most and still scares me to this day (I’m 19 going onto 20 now). The scenes of these movies essentially come back to my memory randomly if I get too deep in my thoughts and it rattles me. It’s been so bad that the horror even affects me when I am in public. I feel uncomfortable when people look at me and I worry they may try to hurt me or even my loved ones. The thoughts of the scenes and the idea of people hurting me and loved ones like that plague me more now that I am studying so much and sleeping less. It also makes me anxious whenever my father puts on a movie to the point I google the plot to mentally prepare. I tend to watch kids movies because I know that will be safe.

However, I am becoming older and will soon have to have my own life outside of my parents so I am more afraid of stepping into this scary world myself.

I am fully aware that it could be dangerous to me and while I'm still at it, I want to have some kind of preventive measures because I'm really about to lose my mind right now. I'm kind of pissed at basically everyone in my life at the moment, even at my own crush whom I perceive as a kind of savior (to whom I normally send my nudes). What should I do to release this tension BUT in a safe way?    
(I did ""share"" my nudes to two strangers previously -- regretted it afterward, felt unsafe)

Edit: STOP DM-ing FOR NUDES!!!!!! I’m gonna block y’all

———————————————————————————
ADDITIONAL EDIT: just wanna give a few updates from after talking to my therapist and after reading some of your suggestions too. (I haven’t read all of them esp the very recent ones—was planning to reply to them, but I’m losing all my energy now as it’s 3 AM here already in my place). A little TMI, I’m also diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder.

Here’s what my therapist said: [ … You can send it to your friends, or post in anonymous Twitter account with 0 follower. You can take as many as you can (to get you distracted) then back it up on your Cloud/Drive account. Send it to yourself is also another alternative. Make sure those photos do not feature your face. Better yet, keep your phone under lock & key and only retrieve it when you are calmed down. Hope it helps. You got this! ]

What I did by far:
1. Creating a spare insta account with 0 followers, started by uploading my normal, non-nudes selfies, ended up not sending nudes at all because I was too busy looking at my selfies and uploading them right before I got to open my hidden nudes folder haha (sorry if it sounds too cringeworthy—kinda feel cute these days). 

2. Impulsively uploaded normal, proper selfies to a subreddit and somehow felt better about it (except for some of the disgusting DMs part). Hope it doesn’t sound narcissistic but, it felt good looking at the number of DM requests though I didn’t reply to them [BUT I truly don’t appreciate some of the DMs coming from this particular post from r/mentalhealth because, apparently, those people intentionally take advantage of me and no, I don’t reply to them :)]

3. Talked to someone, felt good. Made up with my crush, had a good talk with him and he said sorry for not being there for me for the past few days. Had a video call with him as well.

After (1) and (2) I felt calmer, and after (3) I felt amazing.

WHY I TRY HARD NOT TO POST MY NUDES:

[I saw some of you suggesting me to post on Reddit with a throwaway account without my face on, or creating an OF account, or sending it to friends.]

Why I clearly avoid doing that: as weird as it may sound, I’m actually just trying to honor my idealistic principle of thinking that nudes = exclusive, I particularly take them for someone special and send them only to that particular person.

When I said I wanted to send nudes this morning I didn’t take anything new—I was about to send my old nudes from a few months ago. Which was taken for my crush.

In my previous experience, I had to send my nudes at least to 2 or 3 people not out of my will, I just kinda got “groomed” onto it or because I couldn’t clearly say no—only to regret it afterwards. Wasn’t even thinking of my own safety at the time, I was solely disappointed at how I “betrayed” my own principle (NOT betraying my crush, since I’m not yet exclusively in a committed relationship with him anyway). Yeah I’m idealistic AF.

And this I guess is my very first time, for whatever reason (seeking validation? Wanting some tension? Not sure, I guess the first one) I want to share my nudes when (presumably) I’m about to enter my hypomanic episode (in my previous hypomanic episode I was about to fuck random ass dudes, thank god I canceled the plan). And that’s why I was very confused, by my brain was still alerted that I shouldn’t be doing that at all.

So yeah. Sorry for the long ass update. Thank you for some of the nice and supportive DMs — had read some of them, but I no longer have the energy to reply for today.

My parents divorced when I was around 10-12, but it wasn't for this reason.

Why does this happen to me? Why couldn't I have a normal family? Now I'm 20, I've never had a boyfriend because talking to guys makes me uncomfortable and every single time a guy is acting nice towards me my daddy issues start acting up and I feel like he's trying to get something from me. I'm so desperate for a relationship at this point, but I'm also too scared to commit to one. 

And the worst thing is that even tho he's done unspeakable things to me, I still want to give him a chance and forgive him. He wasn't a bad father besides being a pedophile. And I hate myself for it, but I just want my dad to be my dad. It's not a surprise if i confess that i feel attracted towards older men than guys my age, and it disgusts me. I keep searching for a father figure in every single man that I meet. Whether it's my teacher or a bus driver. But deep down, I know that the only man a girl could trust with her life is her father. But who is it in my case?...

Broken man biking across Canada-Update,79,0.99,1686502209.0,"Quick who am I. 
I am a 320lb man suffering from severe depression and other mental/physical issues and a month ago I decided to jump on my bike and pedal my ass across the Country. Well, almost across. Moncton NB to Vancouver. 

I'm unsure how to link previous posts maybe someone could be so kind to do that for me in the comments? Or just go to my profile if you're interested in reading more. 


***TRIGGER WARNING***
These updates are raw and real and I talk openly about my struggles with depression but also how Cycling effects those struggles. 


What is a 40lb update you may ask? It's the amount of weight I have lost in 4 weeks. 

When I left Moncton I was 320. I weighed myself yesterday and was 279. 

My jaw dropped. I knew I lost weight, I could see it and feel it. But forty fucking pounds?? 

I was with a host, my first host on this trip and he and his wife were so kind and so accommodating, I truly will remember them both for the rest of my days. It humbles me and as he seen first hand, I'm a very emotional dude. Depression has broken me, but their kindness broke me too and what they did for me will only fuel the fire that under me right now. 

But 40lbs!!! 

When I set out to do this the goal, as you may all remember, was to end up in BC a different and a better man.  A strong man both in body and mind and I can see and feel the changes now just a month in. 

There was a moment when I thought this was having zero positive effect on my mental health, but I was wrong. Everything that could go wrong had gone wrong and yet I still wake up each morning and head west. The other day I found out my EI claim was denied, I went into the bush and sat there thinking this was it. I formulated a plan in my head. Simple, quick, painless. Like I've thought about a million times, except this time for the first time the darkness passed in minutes and not hours or days. 

Imagine being in a dark room, it's pitch black, scary and noisy. Usually after hours or days i just find myself standing outside that room. I don't know I got there but I'm there. Outside the darkness and the noise and I carry on with my day. 

This time was different. As I was sitting there in that dark room the noise was being drown out by thoughts of and the feelings of energy and enthusiasm and excitement. I cannot explain why or how this happened, it's never happened to me before, but I found myself in my head with my thoughts being able to feel the positivity and, well, the light. 

I was outside of that dark room but after minutes and not only did I find myself outside of the room I was running from it, the energy I felt was like poitive emotions at war with the dark and destroying them so fast. 

I called my sister and told her I'm continuing, this can still happen. The world is changing around me, I am changing. I can do this. 


It feels like I should not be surprised by this but since that day the world has given me my two new friends in Ottawa who filled my bags with food (my gracious hosts) its given me a new supporter who just so happens to work with MEC (huge outdoor supply store in Canada) and had offered to help with gear, bike repairs, solar charger, ect. across Canada and has continued to give me an amazingly supportive community via reddit and Insta who message and share and even donate. 

This trip is me getting my self in order, becoming a better man so I can then advocate for other Wards of the Court who are like me, broken and lost. 

This journey has shown me that despite the darkness the world brings, there's always light around that corner and all I have to do is keep pedaling. 

There are days I don't want to, but I have to. Too much is at stake. 

I'm hitting Ontario today. This is when the real long slog starts. 4-6 weeks before I get to the other side. I'm taking the #11 all the way to the #1 going to put my head down and just pedal. 

Pedaling through adversity.

Struggling with Depression? Don't Forget About Your Dental Health!,78,0.99,1689681601.0,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share a reminder about the importance of taking care of your dental health, especially if you're dealing with depression. I know firsthand how easy it is to neglect our oral hygiene when we're feeling down, but trust me, it can have serious consequences.



For years, my depression kept me from properly caring for my teeth. I often relied on sugary snacks or even recreational drugs to cope, which only worsened the situation. Yesterday, I finally went to the dentist after 6 long years, and I was shocked to find out that I have significant gum disease. I could potentially lose my teeth, and the dental fees will take me at least a year to pay off.



If you're reading this and realizing that it's been a while since your last dental visit, and if you have the means to afford a checkup, I urge you to go. Dentists are there to help, and they won't judge you. Trust me, they've seen it all. Taking care of your oral hygiene now can save you from expensive dental procedures and years of pain in the future.



I understand that not everyone can afford dental care, and I apologize for not acknowledging this privilege in my initial post. So, instead, I would like to encourage everyone, regardless of their financial situation, to do what they can for their oral hygiene. Even if it's as simple as committing to brushing your teeth every day or making small improvements, it can make a world of difference.",mentalhealth,Acceptable-Point4378,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/152whsn/struggling_with_depression_dont_forget_about_your/,7

Why I’ll never cry in front of a women again…,74,0.85,1691454229.0,"When I was around the age of 13-15 I was going to a middle school event on a Friday night, where there would be a whole bunch of fun activities to do. 
On the way there my mom was driving me and as we got there she decided to tell me that my uncle had actually committed suicide a few weeks ago. Hearing that he passed almost a whole month ago and not being told this really made my heart sink to the bottom of my stomach and the only thing I could respond with was “oh”

Anyways after I was dropped off I was obviously completely confused and upset about the whole situation but I tried to keep myself calm and collected, and went to go find my friends to go hang out with.
Everything was going fine at first, I was distracted by my friends and all of the fun games and activities to do there so it was overall pretty fun.

There was a lazar tag inside of the gym in our school so there was a giant line of people who were waiting to play and me and my big group of friends decided to wait the long line, as time goes on we get to the front of the line but I didn’t realize that I was going to be the only one left out because there were already a few people in front of us that got in before we did and I had to be left out, so I waited for them to get back and I went and sat on the stairs.

As I was left alone with my thoughts I started remembering about my uncle who I had suddenly been informed had committed suicide and I was on the verge of tears so I was trying to hide my face in my knees. 
As I was sitting there with my head down a group of 3 girls had noticed me and came to talk to me (after 10 minutes of me sitting there without anyone talking to me)

Anyways they decided to come up to me and ask if I was okay and for some reason hearing those words just made me absolutely break down into tears and I just sobbed into my knees. I tried to speak up but I was choking up on my own tears which made the one to talk to me look confused.
The worse part about this is when I was trying to breathe but I was hyperventilating and they straight up just gave me the cold shoulder and walked away. 
How could you ask someone if their okay and see they are obviously not doing okay and then just leave them there without trying to talk to them?

My sisters mental illness is destroying my home life,71,0.98,1690941661.0,"I never post my first time visiting a sub, but I would truly appreciate some genuine kindness and feedback from people. My sister’s mental illness is tearing my family apart and I don’t know what to do. 

Also, just as a disclaimer, as her only brother/sibling, I obviously do care for my sister very much, but she makes it difficult to maintain any kind of positive relationship. I am in no way on here to drag her, and will not be using her name. 

My sister, who is 34 now (4 years older than me), has suffered mental health issues since she was a teenager, but it came to a head her senior year of college. She had a manic episode on Thanksgiving Day of 2010, left campus, passed out on the side of the highway, and wound up in the hands of the highway patrol. I’m still super thankful she had the wherewithal to call them/anyone herself, I hate to think of what could have happened. The details are still pretty sketchy, but are not the important factor. She was never the same, and was almost totally incoherent for a solid month after in the psych ward. She has basically been in and out of psych wards around the state at least 2-4 times a year in the ensuing 13 years since. The original diagnosis was some sort of medical gray area schizo-effective bipolar disorder, but I believe it has evolved into borderline personality disorder. 

She ended up leaving her career over it, and is now disabled. Every year that passes since she started getting her disability checks, her health has gotten steadily worse. On top of the issues I’ve stated, she’s also severely overweight and diabetic, can’t handle her own finances, has had a bunch of issues with her thyroid, and her meds either completely sedate her or throw her into a non stop mania, and she is incapable of functioning for days/weeks at times because of it. 

My parents were totally unprepared for all of this. My sister was an honors student, had all kinds of accomplishments to be proud of in high school, and sort of seemed to have her life planned out when she started college. I know no one does, but no parent is ever ready for something like this to happen, it was and is still pretty traumatic.

My folks still look after her (she has never been able to live on her own) and she puts us all through the wringer daily. I moved back home 2 years ago when I was on some truly hard times. At first it was fine, and I learned to be patient with her. Now her attitude has become so vindictive to the point she assumes we all hate her, and that our own mother has a vendetta out to screw her over. She’s completely delusional about this, and I’ve had some arguments with her over it when my temper boils over. I’m not going to let anyone cuss out either of our parents (in front of me AND them). Our mother is her power of attorney and controls most of her savings at this point. It’s just the way my sis talks about her, you’d think our mother beat the hell out of us as kids or something, it’s some truly nasty shit she says. 

She is struggling now more than I think she ever has, her mania and mood swings are so bad that she’s delusional and angry all the time, every day. It’s getting very hard to keep being patient, and to stay at home through all of this. My parents and I have all agreed that this behavior is making us all miserable and sort of codependent with her suffering. Sister is making all of our home lives very chaotic. I get to hear her screaming or sobbing at the top of her lungs nearly every day, usually directed at me or whoever is home. And I’m not sure she even realizes it or cares how she’s affecting us. In turn it is making me callous to her entire condition. It’s hard enough to even be at home witnessing her being this disrespectful. This means if I’m not working 50-60+ hours a week, I am at home arguing with what’s left of my only sibling and watching her life fall deeper into the shitter. 

Sister is supposed to receive a deal on affordable housing very soon, but we all of course seriously doubt that she will be able to take care of herself. None of us know what to do. We assume she will move out and be back home again within a few months and in even worse shape. And it especially wears down my retired father, who she has been truly awful to in the past few months. 

I guess the point I’m getting at is that I can’t figure out what to do now. I feel like if I move out, I completely waste my opportunity to save loads of cash so that I can buy a home. I have begun saving, and it is quite possible by next spring if I keep working and saving. But if I stay, I also have to keep dealing with this... I think it’s fair to say she will never be “cured,” and that the best she can hope for is that it gets more manageable. That also seems unlikely. 

I went back to online therapy recently, and am considering going back to my old in-person therapist to work out some of these issues and other personal problems I’ve had over the past few years. My sis and my parents have also totally rejected going to family/group therapy whenever I bring it up.

In the past couple of years, I’ve completely changed certain parts of my life.  I’ve cut out porn, video games, bad food, alcohol, and recently - even sugar.

Something that doesn’t help my situation is I don’t like myself.  I don’t like that I have essential tremors (shakiness) in my hands.  I don’t like that I have some acne on my neck and back.  I don’t like that my personality is not the type that’s the “life of the party” for lack of a better word.  I don’t like that I have some redness in my eyes unless I use special eye drops.

I thought by cutting all of that out, routinely working out, and dressing better - that girls would approach me or show cues that they’re interested in me.

It is fucking hard to swallow the idea that nothing will change unless you basically start immersing yourself in your fears.

"I am not proud of my job, ashamed even, I feel like 'less' of a person, and possibly for no reason. How could I get out of this?",70,1.0,1689166227.0,"Hi all.

All of my life I had ambition, I wanted to be an artist in video games, I got there but it wasn't quite right. But it was still awesome. It was awesome for 2 years until I was made redundant in the recession. Since then I needed a job, any job, and I landed a job as an artworker. (for artworker think of graphic design, but the difference between a chef and a cook as being the difference between an artworker and a designer)

I like it well enough but all I do is practical problem solve, I don't do anything creative, I do the practical side of the business. So we have a logo that has been updated, it is now my job to get it updated on 10,000 documents. It is challenging sometimes but most of the time I feel like a factory worker. 

The thing is, many would love my job, many would like the simplicity of just doing practical work not creative stuff. 

But I feel ashamed of it. Like I wanted to be an artist, but now I just push buttons, noting unique or creative. Not many designers could do what I do because it would bore them, and they wouldn't think analytically enough to do this kind of work. But they still think they are superior (and have shown it).

A new job sounds like it is the way to go but I have no idea what togo into, and I earn 30k which is kind of where the cut off is, I could be a designer and earn no more. So my wage isn't even bad (no great in a cost of living crisis, but not bad either).

I just don't feel right?

I got divorced last year and it messed my head up, I am so envious of friends who are in the military but I am 35...I can't do that. And I gave up my chance because my ex didn't want me to do it. 

&#x200B;

I just don't like what I do, I feel embarrassed by it. Im not a designer or an artist I am more like a technician at best. I feel like I have up opportunities to do other things because others didnt want em to do that and I put others first naturally. 

It has gotten to a point where I sort of don't even want to open my eyes in the morning. I am ok once i am moving more or less but in the mornings i am bad. On m drive to work today I fleetingly imagined just turning the wheel and going off the side of the road. Just because it would put an end to this monotony. 

I don't want this to be my legacy...making forms for clients...but I don't want to jump just because the grass may be greener. 

I just feel lost. And ever since the divorce I have been feeling worse and worse.

He gave them a call and told them I was having a breakdown I cannot speak on the phone and that I am in no condition to work today this was 7 hours before my shift (when I have these breakdowns they last at least the entire day but it's very rare when these things happen I usually can hold my composure) so he got off the phone and said ok so what I’m gonna say may upset you and I’m very sorry and I knew immediately. He said that they said “Is this like a long-term thing because we need workers who aren’t you know. that. so we are gonna end her employment because we need employees who can give their best attitudes and show up to work if she wants to apply in 6 months she can but she has to be happy and healthy” I was just flabbergasted I didn’t even know what to say this was the first and only time I called in.

I was told by him we cannot work the same shifts due to the risk of us breaking up and causing drama in his work environment which is perfectly fine with me.

Is it normal to conclude life at 30?,69,0.99,1690415776.0,"I'm 27, I'm from London UK, I work a job that goes against my personality, I have maybe 2 friends at most, I have never had a girlfriend for the entirety of my life & I don't think I ever will. Growing up I was never diagnosed for my mental health but I'm convinced I'm on the spectrum for autism due to the fact I've dealt with Body Dysmorphic Disorder since as early as age 4 & used maladaptive daydreaming as a coping mechanism to this day. Safe to say my reality is not meeting up the standards, I feel like I've plateaued in life when it comes to improving my mental health. 

I'm turning 28 in November & I have never left the country once, never really enjoyed my 20s due to the fact i can't adjust to social cues. Everything feels forced with me, I used to think I was ugly growing up & I relentlessly focused all my energy on improving my physical appearance. Safe to say now I think im handsome due to the change of reception I get from women but I still don't believe it due to how I was treated by them when I was younger (PTSD perhaps?)... The breaking point for me now is knowing my Mum may never see me have a child at this rate, she is ill & currently disabled in her mid 50s. It breaks my heart all the time knowing she wants to see her grandchild & I also want this but I've always hated myself so much to the point I could never comprehend letting a woman into my life. I feel like I can offer physical attraction, mental wisdom & a reassuring outlook on actual relationships despite never being in one. But outside that, I work an average job, I've got no friends, I'm a virgin, I can't drive & I'm limited on what enjoyment I can actively bring to a woman due to the fact I've never experienced much in my life. This itself has recently stopped me going for a woman I really admire even though she is also going through her own grievances. 

I've always told myself if I just had a taste of what life a normal person gets to enjoy, I'd be way better but I'm yet to come close to those necessities.  I'm inclined to end my life at 30 if I'm yet to develop & change. I can be the wisest in the shed, without experience I have no proof for my brain to validate a fixated behaviour pattern of normal functional living. I am saddened at the idea to hurt my mother further by ending my life at 30 if I'm to be in the same boat but something in me can't accept how people have it easy in life & I don't even have the basic privileges to even live life.

I feel trapped & I feel burdened by my brain, I'm tired of rationalising all the time. Tired of relying on dopamine from content or being reliant on endorphin release from the gym to feel positive. I'm putting a positive front but deep down I'm dying inside. People can say it's ""depression"", but like I said if I haven't experienced anything my brain has no proof to feel validated, for example it's like labeling someone for laughing because they got tickled. Granted the circumstances I'm in, feeling the way I do is a reasonable byproduct and the fact I persevered with low self esteem for my entire life, it shows I'm far from just dwelling over the idea of depression.  

All I can say is, I'll be taking it to the next level  but I'll be open about my experience. If this doesn't work then nothing will work for me. God knows how many people I've let slipped out my life simply because I felt I wasn't good enough and some of them may have even loved me.",mentalhealth,RobinAndBeastboy,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15am1c3/is_it_normal_to_conclude_life_at_30/,38

For example, I got my first (ear) piercing last year and told my therapist at the time about it. At first, she was concerned that I did it because I felt like I needed to in order to fit in. I told her that I actually wanted to and that it was something I was thinking about doing for a whille. She said it was fine as long as I wanted to do it.  
  
So how is suicide different? Why is it wrong? If you genuinely wanted to kill yourself, why shouldn't you do it? What if you just don't want to be alive? What if you just hate it? People always say, ""Do what YOU want to do,"" but why shouldn't I kill myself? Shouldn't I be doing what I want to do? It's my life and my choice, so how does anyone have the right to tell me no, it's wrong? If I wanted to kill myself, why shouldn't I be allowed to do it?  
  
If people have the freedom to do anything they want with their life and they decide that this is something they genuinely want to do, why is it always frowned upon? ""No you shouldn't do it. Your family will hurt. It's selfish."" Well, it's MY life and MY choice. If I didn't want to be here anymore, then I think it would be selfish of others to try to convince me and force me to keep me here. If someone is genuinely suffering and they just genuinely wanted to leave, how is it not selfish for others to tell them otherwise? What gives them the right to take that choice away from them? If someone wanted to walk into a clinic that offers assisted suicide, why shouldn't they be allowed to do it? Why aren't people given the freedom to choose whether they want to live or die?

So during the ride he was talking about his hurt knee...then went into how his life is unraveling.   So I sympathetically listened to him....halfway to the destination he starts complaining of chest pains. I asked if he was OK and needed assistance. 

So I pull over on the shoulder of the highway...call 911..then proceed to make him comfortable..keep him calm and alert while we waited...all while checking his pulse and etc.  He was starting to have more pain...then nothing...no pulse.  So here i am...in the back seat performing cpr until the paramedics arrived...and were able to us a defibrillator and revive him.  Then off they went blazing in an ambulance.

PLEASE HELP! I am mentally disabled snd my mental health care and medications have been taken away with no warning for no reason. What do I do?,63,0.91,1686048451.0,"Hi! I really need your help in figuring out what to do in this situation. First off, I am disabled because of a myriad of mental health disorders. OCD, CHRONIC PTSD, GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER, BIPOLAR DISORDER, PANIC DISORDER, and ADHD. 
I am a patient at a telehealth corporation called Eleanor Health. I had been seeing the most amazing, kind, compassionate,and caring psychiatriast I have ever met in my life for since December. She was also giving me DBT therapy.I was rapidly improving and on a path to a great place mentally, until it was all taken away. 
About three weeks ago my appointments with her started to be postponed. I was instead scheduled with a nurse practitoner who had no knowledge of mental health care whatsoever. There was no explation of why I could not see my doctor. My medications were being shuffled around, or threatened to be taken away. This past month has been one of the most stressful months of my life not knowing what was going on. 
They finally put me on the schedule with my doctor June 1st. I had no idea that this would be the last time I was allowed to see her. She was very heavy hearted as well, and it seems as if someone above her was causing this. She also had me on adderall for ADHD and this was taken away without warning. This was also not her decision.
She told me I needed to get my medical records because she had taken careful notes regarding our sessions together, and my marked imorovement with the therapy, adderall, and other medications.
I am now in limbo. Going thru heavy adderall withdrawl. I cannot get out of bed, I am having severe deoression, crying fits, severe anxiety, my nightmares are back, feelings of hopelessness and despair, dread. Feelings that I’m worthless, uncontrollable mood swings, I have lost 15 pounds in the past two weeks, at times I can barely form sentences, also my haur has been falling out and this has never happened.
They did not offer to replace my psychiatriast. Only said I coukd only see a nurse practioner.
This is blatant neglect, derelection of duty, and absolutely goes against everything Eleanor Health claims to be.
I am a total mess. It is difficult for me to do anything right now. 
I am usually pretty thick skinned bc I’ve been thru A LOT, but this is destroying me. I have brought all of this to the attention of the providers at Eleanor health thru a chat in this portal thing and have been ignored completely.
And this has nothing to do with insurance coverage or anything that would make sense.I guarantee you.
What do I do in this situation? Who can I contact for help? Please. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you So Much!",mentalhealth,Apprehensive-Neck-86,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/142bylp/please_help_i_am_mentally_disabled_snd_my_mental/,14

I will start by saying he wasn't just my ""step dad"", he was my father. The man I remember growing up with, looking up to and seeking hard advice from.

My last goodbye was over the phone, I slept for most of that day in denial or.. something. I saw him afew times before that in the hospital, told him I love him, how much he means to me, things I never got to express. But it was only during that phone call when I felt my heart spill for him..

Then he passed that night. And i'm stuck with the wish that I just really said everything he means to me, to him, face to face.

That being said, he was a man who understood, without the need for something to be said. I know inside he knew how much I care, how much he loved me as one of his own. The pain is wishing I spent more time with him, talking, sharing, laughing. My own mental health always got in the way of that. 

I cannot express how much I love him for understanding that, knowing there was so much I wanted to say to him but couldn't find the words for. He just knew I loved him so much.

He died surrounded by my unbelievably loving mother, his parents, and his sister. Im glad to say he was a man with absolutely no regrets and filled the lives of all his family and friends with love, care, and understanding. I love you, Chris.

If he walks up to you with a slither of hope in his eyes, rub dirt in them”.

Im actually going insane. This isnt about sex, fuck all of that shit. I just want to belong. I want friends I can share great memories with. But now im so far gone that I bask in my depression.

URGENT HELP NEEDED. Kept my friend from suicide for the last 6 years - I don't know how to stop him anymore.,66,0.97,1706480819.0,"I'm super stressed right now and I've been feeling sick for a long while today. Help me.

My friend and I are both turning 17 on February 6. Because of our joint birthday, I see him as the similarly-aged brother I never got. He lives in Australia whilst I live in Norway - yet it has never kept us apart.

We both struggle mentally, but he's on an entirely different level. Having been sexually assaulted at a young age, a manipulative, severely mentally ill mother, abusive relationships within the family, being involved with drugs and then being the one who has to fix it all for his messy family; he's understandably tired and has threatened suicide for every single year that I've known him for.

I've always promised to get him out of there when we turned 18. Whenever he was having a manic episode or just being unwell in general, I told him that giving up now isn't worth it considering all of the years he's been dealing with this - yet we're just one year away from breaking off the chains. He has always believed me.

But today I got the unfortunate news that his mother wandered off and overdosed on valium. The valium HE was prescribed for HIS mental health issues. I'm so pissed about it. According to the doctors, she's not well and she might die. This is worse than anything he has ever endured and it was the last thing we needed right now. I've send him messages wishing him well, saying that I hope he's okay and that he can vent as much as he wants to me. No response.

I don't know if any of them are alive right now but I fucking pray to God that at the very least he's alive. I love him so much, more than words can describe. I'm shaking so much yet I can't cry cause this is not an unique situation.

I don't wanna say it but.. *If* he comes back to tell me what's up, what can I say to make him feel better? I'm exhausted. I'm the only actual family he has but I'm not well off mentally myself and I don't know what else to say. Please please help. I can't lose him.

It's been 9 days since I received a call from my nephew (my best friends eldist) telling me that his Dad was dead.

I spent years dealing with panic attacks and debilitating anxiety but haven’t had one in 7 years. Here’s what I learned through self-healing without medication. I hope it’s helpful to others.,64,0.92,1685513980.0,"•	Anxiety and panic attacks were something I was experiencing, not something that I “had”. Letting go of the idea that this was a disorder or something I had to deal with for life was really important.

•	Meditation in the beginning felt impossible because my Nervous System was so disregulated that my mind and body didn’t feel safe when I gave it space to heal. Persisting was the single best thing I ever did for myself.

•	I didn’t have any self-love or self-care. I realised I didn’t know how to say no to people or things. I was constantly busy and exhausted. I would make myself available to others when deep down it didn’t suit me. Starting to say no was really hard at first but it has been the second best thing I have ever done for myself.

•	I realised I had been operating from my head and was virtually cut off from my body. I could label my emotions mentally but was never actually FEELING those emotions. Meditating allowed me to start feeling safe in my body for the first time in probably 20 years. It also helped me to become more deeply connected to myself, life and other people. My relationships have been so fulfilling and nourishing as a result.

•	I realised how long I had been living in a state of survival and how much of that resulted from childhood trauma. Instead of running from it, I began to deal with the experiences I had growing up and the reality of what that had meant for me. I could then make different choices that truly supported me instead of doing things that kept inducing anxiety and stress.

•	Accepting the reality for things as they are instead of how I wanted them to be was important. The longer I denied my own reality, the worse I continued to feel. Trying to hold on to the stories of what I wanted was far more painful than being honest about how they actually are.

•	Drugs & alcohol had been a way to feel good and confident in the moment but always intensified the anxiety and panic attacks. When I began to calm my Nervous System and stopped living in survival mode 24/7, I felt connected and content within which naturally meant I didn’t feel an urge to do those things.

•	Caffeine helped me to deal with my lack of energy that resulted from never sleeping but it was always perpetuating the problem. The more I had, the more anxious I felt and the more often I had panic attacks. Learning how to put my self-care and needs first meant that I could finally do things for myself that I really needed to heal instead of quick fixes.

•	Anxiety still presents in my life but it is natural, healthy anxiety that comes and goes depending on what’s happening in my life. It is no longer debilitating anxiety and for that reason, I can learn from what it is telling me. I now have a healthy relationship with Anxiety rather than being terrified of it.

•	I have learned to always trust my intuition and gut feeling even though it feels incredibly scary at times to go against the story or conditioned thought.",mentalhealth,Constant-Fondant5454,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/13we8j3/i_spent_years_dealing_with_panic_attacks_and/,33

I hate myself because I gained weight,62,0.91,1703293995.0,"My (25f) entire life, I was 120-130lbs at 5’7. I’ve always been on the skinnier side. I never had a problem with my body image until I started gaining weight. 

I am now 187lbs. The largest I have ever been. I have red stretch marks on my boobs, my thighs, the back of my legs, my fucking lady bits. It’s embarrassing. 

I hate that I’m like this, but I hate myself now. I don’t want to see family because I know they will talk about it. I don’t want to see my husband’s family because they’ll talk about it. I’m scared to go to the store because I feel like all anyone sees is my weight. I haven’t taken photos of myself in a long time. I used to stream, but quit because I couldn’t be on camera. 

I can’t stress this enough, I hate myself. I hate the way I look. I stopped having sex with my husband because of my weight gain. I’ve tried to lose weight but I physically can’t right now. I am always hungry and so tired. I think there may be something wrong with me because of how much I sleep. I sleep 13 hours a day. Doesn’t matter what time I go to bed, I will wake up at 1pm every day. 

None of my clothes fit me. I have to wear my husbands clothes. I recently bought sweatpants because that’s the only thing I’m comfortable in. 

I don’t know why I hate myself so much because of this. I have never thought badly about people who are overweight. I have never treated anyone differently for being overweight. I truly do not care if someone is overweight. But for some reason, I am disgusted with myself. 

I’m scared I will never be my old self again. It’s so hard to ignore the feeling that I’m hungry. I have a hard time exercising because my shins hurt and I get tired so, so fast. 

The worst part is that this just happened one day. Literally. Last year in October, it just happened. I started getting hungry and I began to feel insanely tired. I can’t go through my day without laying down to rest or nap. 

Lately, the need to eat hasn’t been as bad. But it doesn’t matter, I just gain weight like crazy.

Why am I being mean to my boyfriend?,62,0.76,1699369116.0,"My (25F) has a stomach bug, and since then I started being very mean to him. I already knew I had problems with these kind of things, it’s happened in the past with another boyfriend.

It’s like when someone (mostly a boyfriend) is sick with some virus, fever, etc I can’t stand the situation. I start being anxious, panicking and it makes me uncomfortable, and I project these feeling onto that person, being mean, irritable and mistreating him. This usually doesn’t happen if it’s some other type of illness  (like it doesn’t happen with a simple headache or something more serious). I’m also emetophobic.

We’re in a long distance relationship and I stopped replying to his messages for hours, I told him I didn’t want to hear from him, and when he told me he had a stomachache I replied in a very cold way. This obviously led to a big argument where I kept being petty. He just wanted support. My only point was to humiliate him, mock him and make him sad and suffering, even after the argument. I’m hating him. I’m freaking out.

I told him I’m not really myself right now but haven’t told him why. He understands. It would make me uncomfortable and vulnerable just talking about this with him. I know this isn’t right and I’m really ashamed of myself. I really love him and I feel sorry for him, for the fact that he’s sick and that he has to deal with someone like me. I usually am normal and really kind and loving. But I also have this part of me I can’t suppress. 

I just want to say I’m not like this, usually I’m a good and empathic person. But I know there’s something wrong with me. I have other types of behaviours that make me think that. I feel so bad.

A video game community made me depressed for over two years,62,0.91,1709766694.0,"

I wish this never happened to me, not even on my worst enemy.

When I was 15, I used to love a game called Sky, a game categorized as one of the nicest and most accepting communities out there on the internet, and people don’t usually get bad experiences there; but I did, and it was horrible. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to share the name because I was scared of more bullying, or people saying that I’m making this up, for not liking their community. That’s how stressed I was. 

I mainly played it for its musical mechanics, their piano. I used to play it so much that it was just the only thing that made me feel alive. Over time, I encountered many issues in the game so I wanted to rant about it in the community, not in a rude way. Issues with the game mechanics, and other things, like not wanting to be recorded without my consent when I play music. (It made many people there angry for some reason) I also tried proposing ideas to the developers of that game, to tweak a few things so that it’s easier for me to play, they said they’ll get back to that, but never did. 

But because to those certain people in that community, it was a ridiculous thing to be stressed over. So they ridiculed me, and called me names, and said some of the worst shit you can think of, because that’s what the internet does; a massive cesspool, a place where you can anything you want, and not get consequences. A few remaining people still tried to help but were mostly puzzled, but didn’t get why I was so upset over the issue. I wish I knew that before I posted. I didn’t realize at the time that this interaction would truly put a dent in me. 

That was over 3 years ago. For a long time I wanted them to apologize for what they did. To apologize that they hurt me, so much that not even words can even describe my hurt. 

Then I realized; no one cares, I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself, that no one actually cares. I’ve never felt so lonely, so isolated, dejected; it seemed as if no one else had my issues, which made me feel even more lonely, I then get angry and then I cry, and the cycle repeats. It wasnt fair; everyone else gets to be content with their games, while I get traumatized. I remember feeling hopeless for a long time. I wanted to disappear. I probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway, poof, gone in the wind, literally. Haha…….

I’m 18 now. I’m recovering, but recovery has been tough. I’m getting by day by day. I’m slowly accepting that some people are just assholes. And I just gotta move on, despite how painful it was for me. I’m choosing to do other better things in life for me. Hobbies like math, music (other instruments not related to sky), or art. It won’t resolve whatever happened but it suppresses my thoughts for a few hours, like alcohol but without the effects of being drunk. I cannot ever go to the past, and change what happened, what happened truly traumatized me, and I don’t think it’ll ever go away. 

I remember posting about this in this subreddit three years ago. it made me feel bad that no one replied, but wasn’t sure why it was like that. 

I miss my sky musical instrument. It might’ve even become my career choice, if that existed. ",mentalhealth,ConcertReady6788,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b8eev4/a_video_game_community_made_me_depressed_for_over/,39

"My life crashed down around me, how can I rebuild after deep trauma?",57,1.0,1692493831.0,"Hey everyone, I am hoping that by coming here I can find some insight into how to pull myself out of this rut I found myself in.  
  
As a back story, I was married, I have three kids, I was the executive director of a non profit in a big city, I had a large social circle, friends and things to do, and I was quite happy and content with my life. I wasn't wealthy, but I was happy and thats all the monetary gain I needed. Fast forward to 5 years ago, my spouse grew bored and started doing some off the wall things like spending days or weeks away from the home with me having to figure out how to work and take care of the kids. Eventually I found out she was dating another man and asked her to work to resolve it with me or leave. She chose to leave.  
  
I held onto the non profit for a year before finally giving it up, but my mental health has been horrid with no little improvement over the last four years. I have been in 5 relationships in that time, all failed and I blame myself. I am not mentally capable of facilitating a romantic relationship in a healthy way, so I realized I need to just step back and work on myself which is why I'm here.  
  
I have a regular job now, I work a 9-5 which is nice because there is structure. I am not longer disciplined enough to run my own schedule. Perhaps there is just no motivation. I have almost no social circle and for some reason blame my looks. I may not be the prettiest man, but people liked me back then   
I don't understand why they'd have a problem with me now. I go to work and struggle to carry a conversation. I often find myself trying to escape the conversation while at the same time craving the interaction. It's weird. I want to have friends, I want to talk to people, but a friend will call and I avoid the call, I don't pick up.   
  
I forced myself to go to karaoke last night at a local bar and invited some of my friends. Every single one declined. So I sat there by myself wondering what was wrong with me.  
  
I don't believe in myself at all and I think that is the core of the issue. I see myself as a failure. I think people are judging my ugly face and don't want to be friends with me. I feel like a loser. I feel completely alone. I don't get out much because I have my three kids (7, 13, and 14 yo) full time. I want to rekindle my friendships with my old friends but I reach out and they don't seem interested or they don't message me back at all. I want to try and make new friends, but the thought of creating something new terrifies me.   
  
I want to return to the social creature I used to be. I want to be able to carry a conversation and build a deep relationship with ANYONE, even just one person, but I can't. I'm crippled by fear. I get up and leave when someone comes into the break room and it's just us two. I live in this nightmare that I Want to be close to someone, but can't.  
  
How do I rebuild confidence? How can I once again believe in myself? Has anyone experienced this, what can I do?  
  
TLDR:  
My life fell apart when my wife left me and my kids four years ago, and my social life and self confidence have been in shambles and I'm trying to rebuild but don't know where to start and am asking for help from this community to help me get back on my feet and be able to at least carry a conversation without feeling like I'm not worth someone else's time.

"Found out from my new therapist, that my old therapist who abandoned me said she won’t ever work with me again, despite telling me in our final session “that the door was open down the road” for it",56,0.91,1690045911.0,"Last time I updated on this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/14kn5hu/really_struggling_again_after_another_therapy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

My new therapist had me sign an ROI because she wanted to coordinate care with her and find out the whole picture of the termination.

Firstly I found out that my therapist made the decision to terminate me, and subsequent decision to withdraw being willing to ever work with me again, because her supervisors told her she had to (to “protect her license”, which makes it sound like she/the supervisors are throwing me and my well-being under the bus to cover their ass professionally.)

But yeah that’s what my old therapist told my new one when they spoke on the phone.


That was honestly the last thing I was hanging on for. I have no hope. This was the last straw, I’ve been abandoned so many times by so many people that I’ve been close to. My old therapist used to say that “she was the exception” as proof that not literally everyone would hurt and abandon me, but now there’s literally none. There’s never been one exception, not one person in my life, who ended up not abandoning me.

I don’t know what to do. I’m in shock. I was already in shock and disbelief that this was all happening to begin with.

But I had a scrap of hope that this wound could be healed if I got a chance to work with her again and resolve it with her.

The new therapist is okay, but not nearly as understanding or just doesn’t intuitively “get me” the way the old one did.

I have no hope anymore. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I can’t take this.

"Parents forced me to wear diapers and only one set of clothes for school year, now my life is a mess, how do I fix and get past?",55,0.97,1687257298.0,"For context. I was adopted and my foster parents were brand new to parenting. They eventually adopted me. I was very rebellious but also suffering from super traumatic early childhood events, such as getting sexually assaulted and raped by previous foster parents that were men, sexually assaulted by step siblings and mother. Fast forward to 8th grade, I was hitting puberty, and very rebellious. My adoptive parents decided to ""teach me a lesson"" and took away all clothes, underwear, shoes, door off hinges, any sort of privacy whatsoever. I had to shower with cold showers because I was ungrateful"" aka water heater was turned off when I went to take a shower. My parents then gave me a ragged set of Vans, a Karate shirt that I had received from a previous Karate class that year, one pair of underwear, one pair of socks, and one set of shorts. I had to have this set of clothes for the entire year to PROVE that I was grateful to get back my privileges as they said. So no lying, no cheating in school, no ducking around personal questions, etc. I feel like this life event set off a massive traumatic event. I was bullied relentlessly for wearing the same clothes day in and day out, appearing in yearbook photos, activities, sports, etc with the same outfit. I was asked if I stunk like shit because I wore the same thing, if I asked to wear the same thing, if I was only allowed to have one set of clothes. It made me ashamed. I started becoming anorexic, bulimic, staying in the bathroom during lunch and recess, purging after meals at home. Became depressed (I was diagnosed with depression after this event whereas before I never had depression, I was a very happy kid.) I didn't want it getting out that the people who took me in were treating me like this but I was convinced I deserved it because I was such a bad rebellious kid.

This life event has led all the way to now. I can't be photographed wearing the same thing. I can't wear any article more than one day in a row. I have spent thousands of dollars on clothes, perfumes, colognes, shoes, socks, underwear, you name it clothing wise or accessory wise for a male, I've had it it every color, pattern, etc. Some days I have multiple outfit changes because I have the creeping feeling that I've worn it before and it either gets thrown away or pushed into the closet to wear a different day. I hundreds of perfumes and colognes, lotions, anything to make ""the smell"". It's a phantom feeling or smell I get wear I think that I smell really bad and have to cover it up. I will stop whatever I am doing, and excuse myself to put on lotion, cologne, body spray, perfume. Anything because its been drilled into my head that I think someone will comment on my appearance and I want to be prepared.

Was what my parents did abuse? Or were they just being normal parents? When I talk to people about this situation, they chalk it up to them being new parents. Even my parents continually tell me I'm being dramatic and my version of events was nothing like what really happened. They said they got the idea from a church friend.

Another reason why I wear multiple sets of underwear per day is because my parents forced me to wear diapers during high school and threatened to tell my school, and class. They let my teachers know that I was wearing diapers if anyone asked. I was a bedwetter due to being raped and abused and my parents had no idea I was SA'ed. So they kept telling me I was lazy and that I didn't want to go to the bathroom. 

I can't seem to work past these events. I still have hundreds and hundreds of clothes, perfumes, colognes, anything to mask. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos of minimalism and minimalist clothing and it gives me panic attacks to think of someone else wearing the same thing or something that has one shade (one man wears same black shirt, black jeans or blue jeans) it's the ONLY thing he says he has in his closet. His videos pop up and I usually have a meltdown because it freaks me out when I least expect it. 

How do I work past this? I am talking to a therapist but haven't brought this situation to light. Thanks for listening.",mentalhealth,babysloot69,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/14e7jd2/parents_forced_me_to_wear_diapers_and_only_one/,26
The mental health support system in the US is just kind of awful.,58,0.98,1686193664.0,"Like, I get it that you don't want me to kill myself, but you could probably handle it just a bit better. I don't understand why they have it organized in the way that they do. I have to hide everything in my head from everybody just so I'm not thrown into a hospital and locked up like a prisoner, all the while having to worry about constant therapy and possible assault. You can't and really shouldn't force therapy on anyone, yet they do it anyways. None of these thoughts are organized because I just got fed-up with bottling my emotions so I'm not treated like a maniac, and I'm sorry about it. I just wish I could talk to someone without being locked away and forced into therapy, but I know that I'll inevitably get thrown into one. I'm going to a counselor soon, and I'm going to try and be entirely honest with her. With all the suicidal and self-harming thoughts that I've had, I'll be going to a psych ward in no time.

&#x200B;

Like it just feels so backwards. ""Oh, you're traumatized and feel alone? Let's throw you into what is essentially a prison and treat you like a borderline insane, unhuman freak. All the while, other potentially dangerous people can do anything and likely get away unpunished."" I may be overexaggerating, but Imo it's just disgusting and stupid. I don't feel like it fixes anything, but of course since I've never been to one I don't really know. Can anyone who's been to one tell me their experience, and if it helped. Those in other countries, tell me what your psych wards are like too, I'm curious if those are similar to ours, or better/worse.

&#x200B;

Overall I'm just scared. I'm going to get locked away and treated like a danger for like weeks and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm doomed to wander the halls of a facility sooner or later. It's either that or I hide everything from everyone and become lost in myself even more. Either way something awful and traumatizing is going to happen, both of them equally horrible.

I am genuinely starting to lose my empathy as a whole, to friends, to family, the last time I felt bad for somebody was watching fucking the lord of the flies movie (the one from 1990) at the scene where piggy broke his glasses. That was months ago, now I just hate everyone around me, for every single little thing they do. How they speak, Them complaining, I'm just getting tired of everybody, and it's not like that was a common thing for me to do, I'm quite extroverted and it's basically a 180 flip in personality, I started watching gore out of curiosity, I never looked at the popular ""infamous"" stuff but I did see a few of them, like Gary Plauche, Ronnie McNutt but that was basically it until more recently where I saw the definite most infamous ones like funkytown, split faced diver. A few days I looked back on them and I realise, I'm not doing this from my curiosity anymore, I genuinely enjoy this shit and I can't see the people in the videos as real people, I just can't feel empathy for them. The genres of gore I watch have definetly expanded, I used to have a bit of a mental block for compound fractures and stuff showing bones and self harm, that stuff just irked me for some reason, but I'm completely fine with that stuff now.

My boyfriend (38M) feels guilty every time we are intimate. He feels like I (32F) am too young for him.,56,0.94,1700434796.0,"My boyfriend and I haven't been together long, only a month. He's been struggling to keep an erection when we are physically together and often loses it if things progress to sex, which we haven't had btw. He has shared that medically it's not a problem, because he has masturbated alone to orgasm.

He told me that he's never dated anything younger than him, only his age and older, and has difficulty wrapping his head around sleeping with a ""younger"" woman.
After a recent heart to heart I learned that he was molested as a child by two different men, one was a religious leader, and the other was an older neighbor. So maybe being with someone younger than him puts him back into this raw state of vulnerability that he has yet to unravel and heal. I brought up therapy and he shut it down right away. And I get it, this is uncomfortable to sit with.

He says he desires me and is so attracted to me, but once the guilt hits, he just can't seem to turn it off and he loses his boner. He said it feels like a lump in his throat that he can't swallow or take out. He has focused so much on my pleasure but now it's starting to get to me where I can't give in return. I want him to feel good, too!

I want to be intimate with him and support him but I don't know how. I haven't pushed sex, in fact I had insecurities thinking maybe he wasn't attracted enough to me or my body. I'm scared he won't get over our age gap and that i'll be single again really soon.

My therapist told me he is disappointed in me,52,0.98,1696547741.0,"Hi, 
I see my therapist once a week.
Last week when I spoke to him, we talked about how my dad is pressuring me to meet this one woman who posted on Facebook that she is looking for additional friends for her friends group. They like to speak English and so do I (I am from the Czech republic so not a native speaker) so my dad figured it would be perfect to meet them and share our interests. Well, he kept pressuring me, telling me that I will never find friends if I continue living like this etc. I genuinely thought I could meet her but after he kept bringing it up every 15 minutes and giving me monologues on how I don't talk to anyone etc, I became less and less interested in meeting her. 

I told my therapist all that and he said it's okay not to put pressure on myself with this kind of thing. Then I told him that honestly I got used to the idea that I might be alone for some time before I go to college and finish my current school (business school), which is 3 more years. 

He told me I shouldn't think that way and I said that I didn't mean that I am not gonna talk to anyone. I just know that if I try I am gonna fail because that's how it happened every time so far. We joked around about some stuff for a while. But then he got serious out of nowhere and told me ""well, I am disappointed in you. Now you know what it feels like when someone is actually disappointed in you."" And it literally hurt so much, it came out of nowhere. I don't know what he meant by the second sentence since the issues we usually talk about (even earlier that session) are that my family sees me as less than them and everyone is disappointed in me. 

I am so anxious to go see him tomorrow. Should I bring up how I felt last session? I cried on my way home and I think about it every day. I saw him as the only person who gets me and has my back but hearing him say he was disappointed in me literally broke my heart. 

I ended up going to meet with the girl the same day I had the session (after the session), there were more people coming in. She didn't know what I looked like so as soon as I got into the café where we were supposed to meet I got extremely anxious, I ordered a lemonade and sat at a different table. I ended up crying, paid and left and got a panic attack on my way home. I think I only did it to ""prove him wrong"" in my head haha which is stupid. But I was thinking maybe by saying that he wanted to push me in the right direction. Well it didn't end well.

[M32] I'm quitting porn consumption.,50,0.94,1701201378.0,"TL;DR: I've decided to stop consuming porn in all forms. My reasons are non-religuous, non-political and I think they're well-thought based on my experience. I'm currently in the process of deleting everything and closing down all accounts/users. 

Basically that's it. I'm currently in a healthy 5-year relationship with my SO. I've been consuming porn (all kind) for a handful of years and I think I've had enough. My SO knowns I/I've watch/ed porn of all kind and is totally cool with it. We even comment on dudes/girls irl that we encounter.

A few weeks ago I willingly deleted beyond recovery my 1,5TB collection of porn material,, which had been harvested over the years. I thought it would feel like a liberation but it just went as ""meh, alright, delete that shit"". Even the days after, my concern was if my horny-self would deeply regret that decision, but not.
I currently still have my Pornhub and Chaturbate accounts up, as well as the email used exclusively for this kind of stuff and some other websites which I need to track down. These are my next targets for the upcoming days.

My reasons for it? A couple:
1. IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME. Man, I could go edging for like 1h every day. It felt good, but afterwards the blame and guilt for investing so much time were disgusting. I know I can edge without visuals for as long as I want, but the video shit is addictive.

2. I started to kinda ""need"" the visuals to get aroused/horny. Sometimes I even surfed TW in order to get those 30s of stimulus prior to having sex. Not good.

3. I was supporting an industry (doesn't matter if pro or amateur/homemade) with dark interests (prostitution, money for sex, e.g.) I also knew this while surfing but my horny-self was clearly in charge and that issues became totally secondary.

4. The past half year, while consuming porn I started to feel it as an addiction. I wasn't thinking the whole day about porn and wanking, but on the way back home I would definitely think about which user I would watch, where I would wank, etc. instead of using that time to do sth. productive.

5. I've seen increasingly more dudes that also took this step and everything where good words.

6. I have my own imagination, and that's beyond reality. And I sort of lost that ability. Every time I wanked and tried to just imagine a situation and it just wouldn't work.

He says that he hates ""normies"" because they to social event and that he will never be like them. He's saying that everyone hates him and his disgusted by him, or that he's a degenerate. He deleted all his social networks 1 year ago. I tried to hang out with him a few times now, and I thought that it was going better over this summer, but since the beginning of the school year he's been having suicidal thoughts again.

He also told me that he thinks a lot about r\*pe, but not in a sexual way. More like an advanced kind of violence. He told me one day that he wanted to r\*pe a girl he hated, not for the pleasure, just to hurt her. (Or to hire a guy to rape her for the same results). He also said that for the past few weeks, the only thing that would give meaning to his life would be to become a terrorist, just that he doesn't know who to aim yet. He told me that he was interested into going to the shooting range in hit city to pass time, which is something oddly new.I'm sorry if it sound fake or laughable. I don't know if he's serious or just wants to be edgy/provocative. When I asked if he was serious about killing people he said ""I would if I could, but most serial killers had social skills to lure their victims"" and that he wasn't motivated enough.

I don't know what to do. I already told him to see a psychologist multiple time, but he doesn't want to. I tried to give him advices, but I feel like this is doing more harm than good. I also tried to do hang out with him, but it's really hard to motivate him, and we don't have that much time anymore with school. I hope he's not really dangerous, but I don't want to find out that he hurt himself/others and that I could have avoided that.

tl:dr : My friend has suicidal thoughts and wants to harm people (?), I don't know what to do

Why am I so different from everyone else?,53,0.92,1692332869.0,"I (21F) feel like there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm not normal. I know there is no such thing as ""normal"" and that we're all different...but hear me out. I am a college graduate (I actually graduated when I was 19). I see other girls my age going out, having fun, going to parties, traveling the world, etc. all while I'm just here existing. I don't feel jealous or like I'm missing out, I just have no desire to do any of that. Instead of shopping with friends, I prefer shopping alone. And instead of shopping for clothes to go to wear to parties, I prefer shopping for cozy pajama sets and things to clean and organize my home with. On the weekend, instead of hanging out with friends or going out, I complete a long list of chores and tasks. When I don't finish my list, I feel worthless and hate myself. After coming home from work, it's the same routine every day: change into pajamas, relax a little, make dinner, have a shower, relax more, then I'm usually in bed before 10 but don't go to sleep until 12ish. If my schedule is disrupted, I feel agitated.  

It's like I'm an old lady trapped in a 21-year-old's body. I'm not afraid of making friends or going out, it just doesn't interest me. Crowds and social situations make me feel overstimulated, irritated, and uncomfortable, and I don't really see why they're necessary in the first place. It’s not that I can’t socialize, I’m actually very very good at it. I  just don’t like doing it; it’s outside of my comfort zone. The smallest things irritate me beyond belief. I hate 90% of the people I meet and hate going out - I actually have a Vit. D deficiency. I'm much happier in places familiar to me but I'm happiest while at home with my blinds shut, away from the outside world. Maybe I'm just a stupid, lazy complainer, I don't know. I've thought maybe I'm on the autism spectrum, but I don't know that either. Or maybe I'm just really, super depressed. I have depression and anxiety and I honestly feel like my life itself is depressing and repetitive but I'm not necessarily unhappy with it. I'm just feeling mentally and physically depleted and I wish my interests were more ""normal."" All I do is exist. I have no substance. 

My mom thinks I’m just still young and figuring things out and just need to build more confidence but this seems like more than that. 

Sorry if this makes no sense but at least I got it off my chest (kind of).

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not claiming to be on the autism spectrum, it's just something that's come across my mind as a possibility. I was an odd child and I'm now an odd adult, but that doesn't mean that I'm automatically autistic. Just like how the fact that I like to organize and make lists doesn't automatically mean I have OCD. It just means I'm different, there doesn't have to be an official medical diagnosis. If I did want to receive an official diagnosis, of course, I'd go to a professional, not the internet. I did 8 years of CBT and EMDR as well as 2-3 years of OT and never felt it was beneficial. As some of you have pointed out/speculated, I am highly intelligent and mature for my age. I graduated from high school at 16 and from a 4-year university at 19. I will be graduating with a master's degree later this year at 21. I never really struggled academically but found it difficult to make friends and feel accepted, even though I had friends (I become more anti-social and introverted when I started undergrad), I still felt like an outcast.

It's comforting to hear that there are several of you similar to me. It makes me feel more ""normal"" and less like a ""freak"" - I hate those terms btw.",mentalhealth,RemoteShopping7480,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15ua4lu/why_am_i_so_different_from_everyone_else/,69

Boyfriend is running away from life itself :(,52,0.88,1705932877.0,"My boyfriend and I haven’t been together too long, and 100% moved in together too early. I am 24 and he just turned 30. I know everyone’s going to say the same thing everyone in my life says, which is that I deserve better. For one moment I need some people to not tell me that and instead understand that I love this man with everything in me. I have never looked at another person and felt.. idk.. safe? 

That being said, he turned 30 a couple of weeks ago and has been struggling a lot the past few months mentally. He has chrons so he’s sick a lot, even though we try and follow a vegan diet to help. He misses a lot of work due to it and then in turn feels like shit. He is new to the area so does not have many friends but me. I’ve tried to push him out to meet new people or get us out with couples to help. 

Nowww for the hard part… last Monday we signed a lease together to finally get us some more space and pay less rent (we’ve both been really stressed financially). That night we got into a tiff and the next morning he quit his job, called his mom, and moved home. Outside of me being heartbroken, I am so worried about him :(( i feel like he’s just running away from everything because of his depression.

As a child his dad left, and after trying to meet up with him a few years ago and he didn’t show, he’s given up. He was cheated on by a fiancé in 2019. He’s just an anxious sensitive guy who wants nothing but peace, but almost seems to think he doesn’t deserve it? When I said to stop pushing me away, his response was that he has to.

I hate being a mom,51,0.88,1702067809.0,"As the title states. I hate being a mom. I got pregnant when i was 15 and had my son when i was 16. I have struggled with mental health all my life. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder when i was 8 years old. I have tried multiple medications and been to multiple therapist but nothing has really helped my mental health. When i was 13 i started to over sexualize myself. I would wear low cut shirts, send nudes and started having sex when i was 14. That led to me getting pregnant when i was 15. My parents wouldn’t let me get an abortion or give up my son for adoption. The father was not involved and i was left to raise my son alone until i was 18 he took me to court and sued me which i am now 30 grand in debt over. My son goes to his dads every other weekend but that’s it. When I gave birth to my son i experienced really bad postpartum depression. I think i got over it but some days i’m not sure. Either way i have no bound with my son. No connection he’s just a responsibility. Now i take really good care of my son for my age. He goes regularly to the dentist and doctors. Has new clothes, shoes toys the works. Eats healthy meals and i try to give him as much love as i can like taking him out to the movies, doing fun things like the elf on the shelf but i don’t feel anything. I feel like i’m just masking all my emotions and going thru the motions. Lately all i feel like i do is yell at my son because he wastes food, won’t pick up, throws tantrums and i feel like it’s because he is feeding off my energy and environment. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I genuinely can’t do this another 14 years.

Edit: A lot of people are suggesting i give my parents custody. That’s just not an option. unfortunately parental cycles are hard to break. My mom was distant and wasn’t there for me most of my life.

I also took time to blow dry my hair when I typically air dry it (I felt like I'd probably be in a better mood with it more dry than wet) and I used hair ointment I've had after.

I even brushed my teeth, which I never do (I know I should more because I'll regret it in the future but I can't typically bring myself to do basic hygiene).

I'm currently debating on if I want to take a bath tomorrow/later (1:54am) to lift my mood more if I can, I really need to bring myself to relax and I heard a bath can typically help with that.

Seasonal depression and all year stress with anxiety (plus school, since I'm a teenager) is really beating me up and I don't talk about it to anyone for the most part, so it's more difficult to handle since nobody really knows.

I want to start a hobby class once week to get out the house. However, I’m worried that if I start talking to someone, I don’t know how to answer “what do you do for work?”

Due to stigma, lack of societal understanding, and trauma – I’m cautious about mentioning that I don’t work or that I’m working on my health.

I’m worried that people might think or express that mental health is bullshit, that I should “toughen up”, or that I’m a dole bludger. I’m worried that people will avoid getting to know me for fear that my mental illness will burden their life.

I’m stuck on what to say. I guess I could come out with the truth or a half truth, but I’m not comfortable lying. Has anybody had experience with this, what worked well for you? Am I overthinking it?

Vent/non question:
I feel like a loser. I know this isn’t true and that I’m here due to my illness, but I’m worried about being perceived as such.

I kinda felt really jealous that they could talk about whatever they want and they are all happy to input into the conversation and be normal.

"my palm started to feel like plastic, when should i stop washing my hand?",51,0.95,1686227140.0,"last month I developed a habit where I kept on washing my hands using handwash. I just couldn't stop and don't know when my hands should be considered clean and when I should stop washing them. Here are the scenarios where I will rewash my hands using handwash soap:  
  
1- When the water from the sink bounces back onto my palms while washing.  
  
2- When I accidentally touch the sink while washing.  
  
3- I always wash my hands more than twice. I don't know why I don't think washing them once with soap is enough. Is this normal?  
  
4- I wash them more than three or four times after putting my laundry in the washing machine.  
  
5- I wash my hands with soap after using a Dettol wipe to clean my phone before cleaning my laptop. Then I wash my hands with soap again before cleaning my desk.  
  
6- I wash my hands again when I accidentally touch the faucet (tap).  
  
7- I spend alot on cleaning product, my housemate also noticed why i showered for a long time and when the water bill arrived, i dont even know how to explain.  
  
8- i feared washing machine \[touching detergent\] and tumble dryer the most, every time after using it i will wash my hand for more than 15 mins. is this normal, when does it consider as clean.  
  
Sometimes, I don't believe that my hands are clean. It's like I forget when to consider my hands clean. Sometimes, I wash my hands or take a shower for more than an hour. I keep washing my hands after touching anything in the bathroom.  
  
These habits prevent me from doing meaningful things. Sometimes, I don't sleep for days because after cleaning something in my room, I go and wash my hands with soap before cleaning the next thing. It takes so much time that I didn't sleep for two nights. Yesterday, I didn't sleep at all because I was cleaning my phone, debit card, and the sink. These habits also prevent me from cooking my own meals. Sometimes, I only eat bread and biscuits for breakfast and skip dinner and lunch. I have also stopped working out because I'm scared that if I touch the carpet, I'll spread all the germs to my housemates. I have lost a lot of weight because of this, and I wake up with anxiety. Sometimes, the first thing I do when I wake up is wash my hands with soap. My hands are so dry that it's hard for me to fully open them without risking injury. There are razor blade-like cuts on my hands, and now my palms feel like plastic. It doesn't feel normal.  
  
When should I stop washing my hands? When are they considered clean? It's so hard for me to deal with this. I have used a lot of patience, and I want to stop this as I spend more time in front of the sink than on my screen. I can't do anything productive in my life. Sometimes, I also stop hanging out with my friends because of this issue, and my friends ask me why I suddenly disappeared, and I have to come up with fake excuses.

Why are EVERYONE so fake and awful nowadays? I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore.,53,0.93,1708257421.0,"Let me explain. I’m a 22 year old female, and I’ve learned so much recently. My entire life I’ve been very naive, and assumed everyone had good intentions. I have adhd, and I speak my mind, and thought most people did that too. I met a lot of men (and women later) who treated me very badly, and I would always ignore it and blame myself. I had a job working only with females, and I’ve never been close to fake people (that I knew of), so a lot of bad situations happened. They would talk badly about me behind my back, excluding me, making fun of me, using me as a target. Looking back I met/attracted those people because I had no boundaries, didn’t speak up, self-blamed and had very low self esteem. People always treated me badly because I let them. I learned a lot about myself and got a lot of self awareness.

My point is, people started telling me I had to understand that most people lie, are fake, and only act from selfishness and that’s just how the average human brain works. I get so disappointed in humanity, if that’s how most of the people in the world acts. Every time I met someone (usually men) I legitimately thought was nice, they would end up being an asshole after a few months. Proving my point every time. I now have to try to distant myself in my mind, from the new people I meet, because they always end up disappointing me. I would attach myself way too quickly to people in the past, legitimately caring for them, and they never gave a shit about me. 

If you think about how much awful shit, humans have been/are capable of doing (war, torture etc), it’s so scary. Are most humans just naturally bad people? Doing those extremely evil acts, and more “normalized” behaviour like abuse, harassment, lying, cheating, manipulation etc. Is the really how the average brain works?

How am I supposed to navigate in a society with liars, manipulators and fake people? It’s very discouraging and sad. It’s not possible that ALL of the people I’ve met coincidentally were the few bad ones. I’ve gone from naive and unknowing, to kind of cynical. «treat people they way you want to be treated” is apparently outdated. If you’re kind and trusting, you’ll get taking advantage of. 

Don’t know if I formulated this good enough, but i don’t know what to do.

Then, I grew up and I just confirmed my childhood perception. Honestly, it is definitely not an experience that is worth it. Not only that, but I see no rational reason to believe that in the future this will be better, specially considering how things are going in the world right now.

Made my therapist cry today.,50,0.92,1683350656.0,"Trigger warning for mild domestic violence. 

My inclination here is to make some stupid joke about how I won therapy and I'm the therapist now because, that's how I handle tough situations, but that's a different can of worms. There really isn't anything like making a seasoned therapist who's seen it all cry to really put into perspective just how fucked up you are. 

The thing that gets me is that I was just describing my day to day and the mindset I walk through life with. That's my fucking normal. That's the default. That's just my life. And watching her break down and needing to give her a minute really put it into perspective. 

I guess that objectivity is a good thing. One thing that therapy has helped me realize just how much of my mindset was just an assumed normal. That this fucking stormcloud isn't how most people live their lives. I mean we all carry a bag of rocks and if you meet someone that claims to have no baggage they're either lying, not aware of it, or the single most boring human on the planet. But having baggage and normalizing your trauma are not the same thing. 

A good example is that, amoung my other bullshit I was stabbed earlier in life by a partner and my therapist brought it up to explain current behavior patterns and my first thought was ""yeah, but come on. That was years ago..."" A stabbing. My partner coming at me with a fucking knife and here I am putting a time stamp on it like it's expired milk. Like rereading this post I described a fucking stabbing as ""mild"" abuse. I understand that it's a coping mechanism, but jesus christ. I mean she was right though, I was using ""yeah but they didn't stab me"" as an excuse for shitty behavior from current partners. 

I dunno. I guess I just needed to put this stream of consciousness into the world. I just needed to be heard. I needed to make it real by acknowledging that living my life this way is neither normal nor healthy.

Survived Suic Attempt 4 Years Ago. My Scary Experience of What It Was Like,50,0.98,1702521518.0,"\*\*Trigger Warning: My Story Includes Suic Attempt\*\*

&#x200B;

Im coming up on 4 years since surviving a pretty brutal attempt on my life, and wanted to share my story, some hope, a little advice, and reflect on what my life looks like now/WHAT I WOULD'VE MISSED OUT ON.

Jan 6, 2020, id been in a dark place for a longgggg time, and was basically a walking time-b\*\*\* waiting to go off.  My alcohol/drug addiction had reached its peak.  The weight of those consequences was so heavy on me, and knowing the weight my struggle put on ALL my family/friends (specifically a divorce i caused) felt unbearable.

&#x200B;

I was numb and at a point where I was spiritually dead.  I didnt feel happy at happy moments, I had no interest in my fav things, usually things that were sad, I felt nothing.... or at least thats what id thought.  reflecting back, they were very painful moments that i refused to acknowledge, or properly grieve. i self medicated, HEAVILY, and felt it would pass.... it didnt.

&#x200B;

All the negative stuff that I had neglected and used substances to mask, piled up like a log jam, and once it clogged, every new negative piled up farther and farther back. I had dealt with none of it, and it got to a point, where even thinking about trying to deal with a decade of emotions felt insurmountable. Id waited too long, this task couldnt be fixed.

&#x200B;

I was out of town on work, and had went for a walk with no particular purpose, but TICK, TICK, TICK, id been looking for a way out for a while. In an unfamiliar town, I had come to a railroad track right as the gates went down, the flashing red, DING DING DING and the screaming horn of a train coming through.

&#x200B;

At this point I had mastered ignoring consequences, to just do what made sense in the moment, to refuse to look ahead at the consequences of my actions; whether a year, a month, or 5mins ahead... i had conditioned myself to be selfish and only in the moment. Nothing had particularly been wrong that day, but a thought came in--- run in front of the train --- and it ends. I did exactly that.

&#x200B;

Initially after my ""accident"", I didnt remember much, its all a blur, with moments hear and there remembered, especially with time, they started to come back.  Here are some early thoughts/moments I can remember in the following days:

&#x200B;

\-Worst pain imagineable. I have a massive concussion, everything is a 10/10 blur, I think I'll never see again.  Both my arms are broken, I learn Ive already had 2 emergency surgeries

\-My left arm is ""OK"" 12 screws, a few plates, and in a cast. My right arm was a massive compound fracture, with several breaks.... they have it in some type of stabilizing brace, where there are screws into my shoulder, upper forearm, and wrist, my arm floating below it ""suspended""

\-I dont know what state Im in (truck driver), Ive been missing from family 2days with no contact. Im as vulnerable as it gets, and there are no family or familiar faces around. ATROCIOUS (cant stress this enough) feeling

\-Im in a pain med and concussion induced fog/swirl.  I dont remember the beginning of this interaction, but a Doctor is in the room with me.  The attempts to save my right arm have not worked, if I dont agree to an amputation, I will die a pretty miserable death.  Basically, my body has rejected the arm, it is dying, and my liver enzymes are growing exponentially, Im rotting to death lol

\-I DO NOT WANT TO DIE, AT ALL. I dont care how tough, nihilistic, depressed, whatevs you are, I had been in a deep state of all those.... Im not ready to leave, and Im scared of the potential for an after-life

\-I agree to the amputation, but the Doctor gives me lukewarm news... its roughly a 50/50 I pull outta this thing, even if they take the arm.  In a whirlwind of heavy news, this is the heaviest news. Im bawling, and I feel alone, the doctor holds my hand, and at that moment it is the greatest human contact imaginable. Crazy how desperate for human affection I was after years of disconnect

\-I dont remember the start of the interaction, but Im laying down, being wheeled to a room for surgery. Im starring at the drop ceiling as it rolls past, I cant see it clearly, I hear nurses talking, I cant make any of it out, and I think how crazy that THIS is the last moments I get, a pure haze.....

\- Im in a huge (or atleast it seems) surgery room... its crazy bright, it feels like a dozen people are in there, everything is a serious tone, im seeing tables with tools on them, the kind from TV, but this is me, and its real, despite how surreal it all is....... anddddddd now Im counting down backwards from 10 inhaling the sleepy gas through the mask. HOLY FUCK, THIS IS ACTUALLY IT, IM SO DUMB

&#x200B;

\--------------------------- The Big Surgery Complete---------------------

&#x200B;

Im heavily sedated, confused, my moms here though.  She cries, I cry, its amazing im here. Again, all this is incredibly cloudy, its like a film thats been cut in random places, then picks up mid scene, think ""Memento"" hahaha

&#x200B;

Im not out of the woods, we'll have to wait and see how my body responds, Ive had atleast 3 (maybe 4?) surgeries.  The nurses are all so sweet, im so happy to be alive. A few of my regulars saw me come in, had some type of interactions with me, and are so happy Ive pulled through.  I need help with everything, but these nurses dont mind at all. Unable to drink, eat, poop, pee, or do any of the bandages or anything at all. I can feel compassion and tenderness in every interaction... i feel like some sort of strange celeb.

&#x200B;

Within a few days, my brain is much better, I have a rapport with all the different nurses and aids, and Im beaming from my soul.  These ppl DO NOT KNOW ME, and they quickly feel like family.  They take care of my every need, and make me laugh and smile, they bring in food from a local restaurant, and keep me company.  Id been in a cold world for so long.  These strangers showed me all the love and compassion and value that I needed medically, but also emotionally. Somehow they not only physically nursed me back to health, but spiritually as well. Like a light switch, I felt my soul turn back on.

&#x200B;

\--------------Out of Hospital-------------

&#x200B;

In the hospital I realized booze and drugs had slowly extinguished my soul, it was a huge part of it, but there was more.  I immediately got into some Narcotics Anonymous meetings..... the same love Id gotten from the medical staff, I got there almost instantly.  My grim, pessimist attitude towards humans, has been eviscerated by a combination of these two groups of strangers.

I jump into counseling.  Another great move, at first it feels forced, but i stuck with it, eventually build some rapport, and 4years later, hes one of my best friends and my counselor.  We've grinded and knocked down a lot together. Ive learned healthy coping mechanisms. Learned to control impulsivity, especially the destructive kind.  Counseling is a wonderful tool, especially if you have a small or no support group initially.

I got a dog! Man dogs will force some love into your life.

Ive acknowledged all my past mistakes. Ive grieved them. Grieved the loss of my arm, my clean date/acci-versary are at 4years come Jan 6th.

Ive reconnected with family, apologized, been forgiven, and made a point to maintain my mental health/sobriety as a point to not be that guy who has a come to Jesus moment, and as soon as the coast is clear..... hits the pavement looking for destruction.

&#x200B;

Looking back, its crazy to me, that all this was the direct result of a split-second decision (sort of, from oversimplified perspective).  I think about what wouldve happened, had I not done that a lot. While im not 'glad i did it', i also wouldnt trade any of this back for my stupid 2nd arm lol ---im the happiest ive ever been in my life, by far, like sooooooo far.  the saddest part of dying wouldnt have just been dying, it truely wouldve been that i missed out on the chance to be happy. Im at peace, I joke/laugh, cry at commercials, tell my family (and friends- to their annoyance) I love them.

If youre reading this and struggling, please dont harden your heart against this story. Please dont miss out. Realize that - YES THIS CANNNN HAPPEN TO YOU, OR WORSE - only you can fix this.  Find any one thing small you can do, and do the shit out of it.... then add another... have uncomfortable conversations telling family whats going on.  Dont lean into the negativity youre feeling

Im 35 and fairly healthy, Ive adjusted physically, i dont think about the amputation much, it doesnt stop me from doing really anything...... Im blessed. I really couldve/shouldve died. I wont Bible beat anyone, but for those curious, spirituality has been a big part of healing too.",mentalhealth,AmputeeBoy6983,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/18hycxs/survived_suic_attempt_4_years_ago_my_scary/,18

My longest relationship was 2 years and that ended about 8 years ago. I had a 4 month relationship just after, but nothing except being used since 🤷🏻‍♀️

I don’t want to do it now, I’m not actively doing anything to hurt myself or planning anything out. I just know that I deal with derealization and severe existential crisis on daily basis and it’s gotten so intense. I don’t want to be alive for 80 years. I’ve not had the best time living and I’m constantly in a state of hyper awareness anxiety. It sounds horrible but I genuinely don’t even wanna live till 40. My entire life doesn’t feel real. I look back on my childhood and genuinely cannot fathom that it was me. Those memories are me. Thinking back to when I was 3 (my earliest memory) I feel like it was lifetimes ago. It doesn’t feel real. I cant live like this for another 60 years. I’m not sad or like nervous about the future. It’s almost peaceful to know that I can really enjoy the next few years of my life and then I can die content and happy.

My boyfriend is making me feel exhausted.,50,0.95,1706902797.0,"Context for my current life. I moved away from home about 7 months ago now right after graduating high-school to be with my boyfriend (Lets call him J). I had been living with a roommate but after a couple months J had a mental health crisis and I had to move him into our apartment because he said he wouldn't be safe if I wasn't with him everyday. I didn't really feel ready for that yet but I obviously didn't want him to hurt himself so I had him move in despite that.


For context on J, he has BPD and Autism. He's undergone a lot of traumas and mental hardships, I completely understand and accept that he feels differently and often times more strongly than I do, and that it is hard for him to manage himself, but I feel completely worn down trying to take care of him.


J likes to go to music shows and venues, that really helps him fulfill his social needs. I'm more introverted, and those sorts or things are usually pretty draining for me. I've expressed this to J but I always end up going with him anyways. J doesn't drive, so I drive him usually around half an hour to go to these shows. I know J has other friends they could plan to go to these with, but ever since I've moved here I've been the person going with him. This is because J doesn't feel comfortable going places without me.  No matter what I don't really have a choice except to accompany J to these shows, because if I don't they won't bother to go with someone else, and they will have a breakdown later.


When J has a breakdown, I am the one who stays with them and makes sure hes safe. These breakdowns can last hours, and he has yelled, insulted, and pushed me (never enough to make me fall or cause harm) during them. These breakdowns are absolutely exhausting and traumatic for me to deal with, so most of my energy goes into preventing them from happening how ever I can. These breakdowns can be caused by a lot of things, some recent examples being


-The house isn't clean enough

-I don't want to be sexual with J at the moment, even though he wants to be

-J is tired

-J is hungry


There's other reasons Js has breakdowns, many of them are reasonable reasons to be upset, stuff like J feeling like im not properly addressing or handling his health (J has epilepsy,  and there are times I could have better handled situations regarding that.)


To make sure J doesn't have a breakdown I basically always have to be on stand by for him at all times. He mostly asks me to do simply tasks like making food, or going to the corner store to get him something. Nothing that really should take much out of me, but the fact that I have to deal with these things immediately and without negotiation whenever he wants is a little stressful. If J asked me to make him food and I said no, he would feel neglected, and probably not eat, which could lead to a breakdown. I just really wish I had my own time and space where I felt like I could just focus on myself.


J and my roommate don't get along because they dated in the past and had some major problems. J doesn't even want to talk to my roommate, which means I'm usually the one medigating between them. J wants to use the TV but roommate is using it? I have to ask to use it on his behalf. Roommate left a mess in the kitchen? I have to bring it up to roomate. 


I feel selfish but I can feel how tired I am. I'm irritable all the time, and I hurt myself pretty often because it's the only way to manage that. My memory is awful, and I feel like I'm in a haze a lot of the time. I don't eat enough anymore, and large aspects of my life are going neglected because I can't muster the energy to deal with them. I'm fucking losing myself, even writing this I realize how much off and robotic I seem but that's all I can be. I've been wanting to write a post like this for a while and I just didn't have the energy until now, and even now I don't have the energy to sound anything but robotic. I'm trapped in my life and I feel like I'm completely drowning.",mentalhealth,AlienBovine,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ahc8cw/my_boyfriend_is_making_me_feel_exhausted/,44
Life is great. And I want to die.,46,0.97,1702478542.0,"I haven't slept in 36 hours. Cried silently and alone for about half of that time. I'll try to keep it short:

* I am 24F, almost 25, and am Asian, if that helps provide any general cultural context for what's to follow.
* I was diagnosed with major chronic depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, bipolar 2, and ADHD around 21 yrs-old when I finally got health insurance for the first time and sought help. It took that long because my family just never understood what mental health was, let alone seeking professional help/diagnoses, and we went through financial hardships throughout my high school/college years so we wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway.
* Despite being undiagnosed with so many issues and experiencing a wide range of traumas, I grew up relatively well-adjusted, and a star student. I played multiple instruments, I excelled in sports, won medals, graduated high school with a 3.97 GPA, got scholarships into college, and even graduated college at the top of my class as salutatorian in 2021. I have many friends and am part of many social circles.
* My mom, the absolute most loving, supportive, beautiful woman in the world.. was diagnosed with Leukemia in my senior year of college. I'm so thankful she lived long enough to watch me receive my diploma. She died from Leukemia the following year in April 2022. Our entire family was lost without her. I was (and honestly am still) absolutely destroyed by her death. I was her main caretaker for the last few months of her life. I was with her in hospice when she took her last breath.

So here I am. Still grieving. Unemployed since August because I work in the animation industry and I think we all know how *that's* been with the recent strikes.

I don't know. I don't know what to write. I'm just rambling because I'm spiraling. Am I writing a *note?* 

Once I was diagnosed, I did start medications, and kept with them for about the last 2.5 years until my health insurance (provided by my employer) ran out because we were all laid off. I've been off them since August, so if I *did* go through withdrawals, I honestly couldn't tell you because my life has never been stabile enough for me to have a baseline to compare to. I could've been taking sugar pills for all I know, I don't know. Maybe the medications just lessened how extreme the extremes could be, but I know for sure that before, during, and after meds, I have and still always feel depressed, anxious, low energy, low motivation, irritable, self-deprecating, etc, etc. 

But on paper, I'm so successful. To my peers and relatives, I'm a role model. I'm the first descendent born in the US to graduate from college, and as salutatorian. My name can be found in the credits of a very successful TV show. I have an incredible support system through my dad, my brother, my SIL, and my partner. I have a house under my name.

And I want to die. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing brings me any lasting satisfaction. I try to stay social, reach out to friends, go out on dates, and we regularly have family dinners. But everything is just a distracting from the never-ending inner turmoil I'm going through. When I stop moving, when I lay in bed and everything is quiet, all the negatives thoughts come back, and I grieve for my mom. The ""nothing makes me happy"" part has been a thing since high school, well before she died, but it definitely amplified with her passing.

I feel nothing from playing video games and hobbies that I used to love when I was younger. I eat like shit and have become overweight. I feel like a disgusting shell of myself. I hate the way I look in the mirror, and my brain just tells me, ""You let yourself get fat and ugly. You deserve to stay fat and ugly."" even though my family and partner regularly reassure me that I am still beautiful and that my worth isn't tied to my appearance. But I can't help it. I was the ugly kid growing up, then I had a glow up in high school and looked good as hell through college. And then my mom died, so I just stopped taking care of myself. In a similar way, I was a spoiled upperclass kid growing up, then suddenly poor through middle and high school, then back to being very comfortable once the new family business kicked off during my college years, so now I don't even know how to feel about money.

I know I need therapy. I've never had therapy except some crisis counseling I got through my university, but they weren't even licensed therapists yet. They were interns/students still working on their psych degree. I enrolled in obamacare this November, so I should finally have health insurance again starting January 2024, but I don't know if/when I'll find a safe and reliable therapist.

Will I make it to Christmas? Will I make it to New Years? Will I make it to my birthday the following month?

Part of me wants to die, part of me absolutely refuses to put my family through that after having lost Mom, especially to my dad and brother who have shown nothing but love and support for me. Truly, I am so, so, so, lucky.

Which is why I feel even more guilty for feeling this way. Life is so good right now. Our family business is bringing in a comfortable income, and I'm not being rushed or forced to get any menial job that'll likely add to my stress. Everyone gets along and loves one another, and especially love me.

And I still want to die. I've always had it at the back of my mind since middle school. I've never self harmed in ways that would be permanent (cutting, burning, etc), though I did develop an unhealthy coping mechanism of bashing my head/forehead onto walls/tables and digging my nails into my palms.

I'm just.. I don't know. I just sobbed and doomscrolled throughout the night and now it's 9:30 in the morning.

It’s not hard to me to admit this, I genuinely believed I was a victim for a long time, I’m not sure why, perhaps I just felt so horrible and bad 24/7, so I just labeled myself a victim in all of these situations, because then I had a REASON an EXPLANATION to why I felt as bad as I do.

I (19F) think i’m a cocsa victim but i’m not so sure.,46,0.99,1694256404.0,"So a couple of months ago i came across a tiktok of a woman discussing “cocsa” and how it’s rarely talked about. I wasn’t sure what that meant at the moment so i looked into it more and it uncovered a memory I locked away in my head.
When I was 6 or 7 my cousins slept over at our apartment and in the morning we decided to play house with my siblings. My cousin who is a year older than me, so at the time either 7 or 8, took charge and assigned everyone roles in the house. He made my 3 siblings and his 1 brother be the children, and him and i be the “mom and dad”. I remember we had a closet with a decent amount of toys in it so we all ended up playing in there. When our siblings left the closet, he urged me to stay in the closet with him. He said mommy and daddy’s have to kiss because that’s what grown ups do, so we did. I dont remember it lasting more than 30 seconds and that’s stretching it. When I left the closet, we heard spongebob begin to play on the tv in the living room and our siblings went running to sit on the couch and watch tv. I remember exclaiming “ooh spongebob!!” and then turning to walk away, but he grabbed my arm and told me to stay and that he thought spongebob was boring. I said okay and sat down with him on the bed and he started kissing me under the blanket. Somehow my curtain rod fell off the window, I still don’t know how it did but it was never really reliable in the first place. That scared me a lot because I knew what we were doing was wrong so I told him I really wanted to watch spongebob. He told me to do one more thing, even typing this right now is making me sick..he made me perform oral s8x on him, but he said just do one lick. Afterwards he kissed me again (still under the blanket) and my dad came in and pulled the blanket off and he grabbed me. my dad pulled me into my moms room where she was sitting with my aunt folding clothes (his mother) and he said out loud “(my name) was in the room kissing damn (his name)” They both got up fast and my aunt went to get him and talk to him in the other room, and my mom talked to me in her room . She asked me why I did it..and my answer was “because he made me do it”
I can’t remember what happened after that, but my cousins left pretty soon.
This whole situation just bothers me constantly. Like, I KNOW i was a child but why didn’t I just leave the room..why did i let him take control over my mind like that? But why did he do it in the first place and why me? and we were so young, does it even count as abuse? I don’t have a relationship with him nowadays, and even in our older kid ages, i still kept my distance from him. I was 11 when I went to his water park birthday party and I remember just not saying a word to him because I was afraid he remembered what happened back then. We were in the lazy river and he caught up to me and he started to speak but before I could let him get another word in, I submerged myself under the water hoping he would be gone when i came back up but he was still there and asked me “remember when we were little , you were always so happy to see me “ and i gave a nod and floated away. Anyways that kind of went off topic but i’ve been thinking about talking to my mom about it but i have no idea how to bring it up or what to say at all. I feel that one incident opened my curiosity up at a really young age to where I began watching porn at the age of 8. Fortunately my mom caught me and introduced me to a game called Roblox that took my mind off the inappropriate thoughts for a while but i eventually started seeking out inappropriate games on roblox for a while and to my surprise there were many. I won’t get into any more details about my current state but I Am no longer interested in watching porn and i would actually rather consider myself being a prude. I even convinced myself i was asexual for a while but i debunked that pretty quickly, despite not being a virg. I just feel so shitty and weird and disgusting for what happened when we were little and i strongly believe that one moment shaped my sex life. Should i mention it to my mom ?

I need help quitting weed for my mental health ,46,0.94,1709128921.0,"Hi, 

I’m a 23 year old female and I’ve been smoking weed since 17. It didn’t become a problem until the age of 18 where if I couldn’t get any, I would go absolutely mad until I did. 

I struggle with extreme depression and have recently tried to unalive myself. After this incident I have finally realised what a shit show my life is and want to turn it around. 

I am on route to fixing my mental health and addiction but am struggling to start my journey. I have so many people in my circle that smoke and it’s hard for me to say no when offered.

I don’t have the money to spend but I always find myself spending money on weed rather than essential things like food and bills. When being in debt already it’s the worst feeling in the world. 

My parents and partner cannot stand the fact I smoke and to be honest I can’t stand it either. It’s not who I am. 

I’ve been trying to cut down but it’s just not working and I’ve tried cold turkey in the past but always go back. I’ve come to a conclusion that it impacts my mental health negatively and does me no favours. 

I have also gained a lot of weight from binge eating after smoking and I feel disgusting. 

I would love some help as I’m ready to get my life back after so many years of devoting it to something that doesn’t even help me like I thought it did for so long.

I was unable to complete my shift, so his friend took me home. When I woke up that morning, I had no underwear on and a different shirt and could barely remember anything. I did not drink much that night.

I immediately called my parents because I knew something was not right and I was scared. They didn’t really seem to care or help me with the situation. I went to the hospital and it was confirmed that I was raped. 

I filed charges and talked to a detective but ended up not following through with everything. Not sure why, maybe I didn’t have the support back then and I had no self confidence. But looking back, I wish I would have pressed charges. I just blocked everything out of my mind.

Breaking up fucking sucks,44,0.96,1693255243.0,"We broke up a week ago. I still love her so much but it wasn't working anymore. 

Now I'm stuck yearning for her. The thought of never being able to kiss her again is killing me. Knowing that I'll never hold her or be able to call her mine is tearing me to pieces. 

For a while I thought she was the one. She was it for me. She's the first person who has made me feel like I'm worthy of love and happiness, and I'm so grateful for that, even though that's ultimately what made me realise that we couldn't be together. 

In my past relationships I've stayed despite the relationship making me feel awful. My last one before this caused a SH relapse and I still didn't leave. I didn't think I deserved better. I didn't think I deserved to feel good in a relationship. 

I wish she could've been the one. I know that she's not, but it still feels like part of me is missing without her.

I feel like I've lost everything.,43,1.0,1688464657.0,"I've genuinely lost everything

I have done it.

I have made the mistake of laying all my future plans and goals, all my love and affection, all my dreams, all my hopes, everything I ever wanted to achieve on this one person.

She was the biggest support pillar in my life, despite not doing anything. She didn't need to do anything to be that to me. All I needed, was her to just love me and be happy, just enough so she would stay by my side.

But I failed. This wonderful, amazing person, this person I prioritised over everything, lost feelings for me.

She came into my life so willing to love me, and I funked it up. I made so many bad decisions, so many fucking mistakes.

I tried my hardest to fix things, despite feeling her slip away, feeling her slowly drift apart from me, I kept going. 

I truly thought I could make it work.


It's been 3, maybe 4 months of no contact. I've had to try so hard to not contact her, to not send her heartfelt messages, to not send her voice recordings of how much I love her still, because I know she's happier, and I know that she knows how much she means to me.

She just doesn't want to be with me, and I can barely wrap my head around that thought. 
How? How could I have funked up this badly?

Things weren't perfect but I didn't care, all I wanted was for her to be happy with me, and after 3 years of us being together, of ups and downs, I failed.


She was my everything. Now I don't even feel like moving on is an option, despite being forced to. It feels like I've just been left behind by the person I loved most.

Why should I even try and be happy, and achieve goals. Why should I put myself first, after I funked everything up.


I can't even believe that I can be okay without her.

I'm in so much emotional pain that my chest is genuinely hurting, physically. 


My heart wants to crawl back to her, to keep trying everything to be with her, but my mind knows that it won't ever be enough.

There's nothing I can do to make her love me.
And you would think, that that would give me enough closure to move on. But it's just making me feel helpless, lost, scared. 


I've only been surviving by following some instructions from a person that genuinely cares for me: ""take it day by day.""

But it still hurts so much. Each day feels so fucking hard to go through.

I was so okay, so used to loving more, giving more, sacrificing everything for her. I didn't care about that. All I wanted was her to be happy and love me, even half as much as I loved her.

But I failed.

I felt so responsible for her happiness, I just remember how confident she grew into the relationship, and I truly felt like it was my job to keep her always happy and to protect her from harm. But now, now that she's gone and is happier without me, I feel I've failed beyond belief.

And I appreciate a lot when people try to tell me that, if she was truly the one she would have stayed, she would have helped work things out, but how can I genuinely believe that statement, if I wholeheartedly know that it was my mistakes that slowly drove her away? 
It shouldn't have been her responsibility, she gave me another chance, but unfortunately she herself wasn't able to truly love me even after that.


I'd wish that she just knew how much she truly meant to me, how much I truly fucking love her and how I will never be able to forgive myself for ruining things.

Towards the end of 2021 my brother began to develop depression and anxiety, he was 15 years old at the time. In January of 2022 he broke into my fathers gun safe and told us that he was going to take his life. My parents sent him away to a mental facility for 2 months. Ever since then he has he aggressive outbreaks for 2 years and has been sent to mental facility’s multiple times. Now at the start of 2024 he is at a point where he has completely isolated himself in a extra bedroom of our home. Whenever we would try to approach him he would begin to show aggression. When this first started he would come out a few times a day to use the restroom and to eat and drink water, fast forward to now he hasn’t been coming out at all. He has torn up the room, clawed holes in the bed, ripped off parts of the wall and other things of that nature. He hasn’t come out to eat in a little over 24 hours, nor has he coke to get water. As of yesterday the door was open and my mother saw that there was a large puddle on the bed of urine. My mother asked him about it and she saw that he had completely peed himself. He gave her no response when she asked. She cleaned up the bed and sheets but he refused to take a shower or change his clothes (he has not showered, or changed clothes ever since he started isolating himself). Now to today, my mother went to go check on him due to having worries about him not eating and his urine incident from last night. When she went in the room he was sitting on the edge of the bed shivering and just staring into the distance (keep in mind he has no phone so we don’t know what he is doing in there all day every day). Later she came back into the room to find him standing up with urine rolling down his leg and standing in a puddle of piss. That brings us to now, we don’t know how to get him somewhere (because it is obvious he needs help). He isn’t a harm to himself or others so the police can’t help and we know for sure he will not get in the car to go anywhere. So I am asking for options because he needs help urgently.",mentalhealth,DapperShoe2550,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1agt7wx/my_family_needs_help_we_dont_know_what_to_do_with/,19

he was a marine. served 30 years. was honorably discharged, so he left and met my mom. they married, he moved it. i was maybe 4 or 5. i knew this man my whole life. the man i wish was my biological father. but that’s neither here or there. he’s my dad. period. 
the thing that’s weighing on my so much i can’t breathe is how much he confided in me. told me secrets he swore himself he’d never tell anyone. after each talk i felt like i walked away with 200 extra pounds on my shoulders. 
he was a functioning alcoholic. wasn’t one of those angry drunks. 
i found his diaries. seeing what he wrote. his decline, what he was going through. his anxiety and ptsd. he was suffering alone. he didn’t. have to. that damn stubborn man i swear. 
i went on a 4 day trip with my fiancé. i came back and saw him. he looked normal. but he didn’t come out of his room the whole day. 
i went in there and he was a mess. couldn’t control his bowels. shaking uncontrollably. said he was cold. i gave him my blanket. i’ve seen him like that before. it was usually something i could do to fix it.

me and my mom cleaned him up. he was shitting blood and throwing it up
the look he gave me before the ambulance door closed. oh my god i’ll never forget it. how soft his eyes were. i’d never seen them like that before.

HELP ME : I got groomed and sexually assaulted and I don't know if i want to go to court,42,0.9,1708266783.0,"I (M14) is friend with a really cool guy well name Ethan i met on valorant 9 months ago. Even though we were online friends, we were really close and basically knew everything about each others irl life. Same with others member of the discord we were on. Ethan had a lot of brothers, but the one im gonna talk about in this post is K (M26). There were rumors about K being a pedo, as he had apparently asked for nudes and threatened to rape a girl that was on the server. It started when she was nine, shes now 16. This girl is no longer on the server cause of arguments.  


So, a few days ago, K dmed me, i instantly thought that was weird cuz why would he dm me THE ONLY MINOR and im also ftm so my voice is girly out of all the other online people. We werent close at all, only talked each other 2 or 3 times. Third message he sent already had sexual connotations, and we kept talking, he was always talking about sex and how people love ""femboys"" like me. I texted Ethan about it, and he go angry at me, saying I had to stop seeing him as a pedo as there were no proofs what the girl, lets call her Eli, said was true. He said this was a normal conversation we could have add cuz we like to do sex jokes. He convinced me, and I felt bad for seing him as a pred, so i kept talking to him like i normally would with anyone.   


The next day, after once again a conversation filled with sex ""jokes"" he asked my insta cuz he wanted to say something private to me. I did, turn out the private thing was that he wanted to jerk off to my ""femboy ass"". Thats when it got fucked up, he started asking for pic and sex calls, threatening me and my family when I refused. He then threatened me even more with these pictures.  


I felt like shit, and didnt know what to do, so I went and did the only thing i could do, I talked to Eli. If this happened to her, she would understand how i felt. I hadnt talked to her for months, and she shared that K was still asking her for things and talking to her. She told me to block him, that he wouldnt do anything since he would be the one in trouble. As stupid as this sounds, this really helped me. I blocked him everywhere, and went to talk to ethan about his brother. He believed me, said he was sorry for not taking me seriously, and banned K from the server so i didnt have to leave. Him and another friend talked to K and Ethan's mom.   


Fast forward to now. K's mom wants to talk about this to their therapist, and talk to me tonight, which i  will gladly do since i feel really bad for this poor woman. The other is telling me I should go and file a complaint, and I agree. (He did this to atleast three other girls without counting eli and I). The thing is Im scared, scared to talk about it to my mom and the police. I know i need to but i just want to never talk about this again. I want to throw up just thinking about it.

I have lived in hell. I planned my end and went to do it. I was moments away from doing it. Then I had a thought about my dear mother grieving me ending my own life, it stopped me in my tracks.

I decided to dedicate my life getting better. That was 10 years ago. If I ended it that day, I wouldn’t have experienced the best 10 years of my life. Since that day I have married my dream wife, had a beautiful baby boy, followed my wildest childhood dreams to make ocean documentaries and made and starred in a Disney series, bought my first home, travelled the world, made beautiful friendships and most importantly of all I am now stronger mentally and physically than I have ever been, and it’s all thanks to going through the hell of what I went through mentally after my brain injury.

There’s no way you have tried everything because there are limitless possibilities of ways you can get better. Keep trying! You have the strength of thousands of years of your ancestors. Visualise getting better. This storm is here to make you a warrior. All the most beautiful and powerful people on this earth have been through hell.

How did I do it? Focus on your health 110%. Move your body, exercise, eat clean unprocessed food, get sunlight, nature, dogs :), friendships, have a clear goal and purpose to work towards and have a plan of how you’ll reach that goal, watch inspirational people, limit screen time, push yourself outside your comfort zone daily, follow your passions, research scientifically proven supplements that can help mental health, each of these improvements will get you a little stronger each day and before you know it you will look back with pride that you have weathered a hellish storm and came out the other side as a warrior who can take on anything.

I am a 20yo young man and live with my parents go to school and work a job, my Father is a hard worker that is working countless nights trucking for the family but usually isnt around due to his working. My mother raises the other 4 children in my family on her own and works at a daycare on the weekends. Our family was never wealthy but we always had just enough to get buy.

&#x200B;

Now as for my sister lets just call her Jessica, she has always been an anti-social type, she never really had many friends, and she spends most her days in her room drawing. Aside from that, she would eat with the family and didnt cause problems.

This past year however, Jessica has gotten progressively worse; nowadays she completely neglects herself and her surroundings, does not ever interact with family, she does not eat any food except for barbecue chips and coke and says every other food is dirty, she will barely sleep, she even developed something in her mind that everything is dirty and will spend hours in the bathroom trying to ""clean"" something even if it was never dirty to begin with.

She refuses to sleep on her bed because its ""dirty"", she refuses to even open a door without having a napkin covering the handle. Whenever, shes confronted by Mom or Dad for this she just has an emotional breakdown and never changes her ways.

I feel horrible for my mother, she deals with her problems everyday Jessica has made her cry because my mother just doesnt know what to do with her as it seems like it gets worse for Jessica by the day.

&#x200B;

Our family does not understand her problem, we desperately need help/information on how we can fix this and get Jessica back to living a life that is not miserable and self-harming to herself.

So I recently had an exam I was not ready for at all - did not study due to personal issue but the day before the exam at about 9pm. I got some adderall from a friend and took it (it says 30 on it so I’m guessing 30mg)

I feel pathetic because my parents witness me having them. Which mainly is me just crying uncontrollably and trying to stay away from others/hide it, but I’m not good at hiding crying. 

I want to hide it because everyone always asks “can I do anything to help” which the last thing I want when this is happening is any sort of attention. I cannot think rationally when I’m in this state, so verbalizing my needs doesn’t work, I just shut everybody out because I’m not thinking straight. 

And yes I’ve been in therapy most of my life, but haven’t needed it in a year or so. I don’t think therapy will help in this situation as I’ve tried it before and didn’t help long term and hardly short term. 

I know what I need and it’s to cry it out, crying is my bodies way of releasing stress (and humans in general but most don’t let themselves cry which sounds awful). But regardless it makes me feel down in the dumps as I’m crying, but after I often feel relief. I guess I just have to live with it.

I’ve been told by my brother growing up that my crying is “pathetic” so I think I internalized that opinion of his and now believe everyone views crying as pathetic. I just hate to be a bother to others.

I just hate that every time i have this situation i will be out of commission, i told my best friend that i will visit her today in the hospital since her father is hospitalized and she is with him ( same where i work) but now i don't have enough energy to spare and feel like the asshole for not being there for her when she needs me the most. 

I'm just really tired.

Edit : i went back to sleep but guess what? Had another nightmare where i failed again, but was saved again by my best friend calling my phone, i visited her in hospital but refused to hangout with her due to my extremely bad mood, this the first time where i have multiple nightmares regarding the same thing in one day, yay looks like it is becoming worse",mentalhealth,Anon-1105,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15g3jsk/my_mental_health_is_deteriorating_and_i_dont_know/,26

I recently found out I'm not ok.,40,0.98,1712148810.0,"*I'm not sure if that's the right flair. This is more of a vent*

I don’t remember much of anything from 0-8 years old.
During that time, my parents filed for bankruptcy, my mom worked nights, my dad got let go and no one was hiring, we had 6 people living in a >2 bedroom apartment/house (we kept moving). 

I went to cbt therapy for 2 years for my OCD. This year I started talking therapy. I was telling him about my life and how I was always considered the golden child, and he asked me ""why?"". ""Because I was a good child? I did my school work without complaining, I never spoke unless spoken to,, I went to bed right after dinner...""
He interrupted ""why?"". ""Because that is what good kids do, and I'm a good kid?"" He asked ""why did you want to be a good kid?"". ""Because bad kids get in trouble, and I'm not a bad kid."" He asked ""what happened when you got in trouble?"". I froze, this conversation had seemed pointless to me but I suddenly felt like I couldn't speak, my eyes started watering, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. ""Nothing"" I said, ""then why are you shaking?"" He replied. ""I don't know"".. ""did he hit you? Did your father hit you if you got your homework wrong, if you didn't go to bed after dinner, if you spoke to much? Is that why?"" ""I don't know. He didn't hit me. I dont remember him hitting me, only yelling quietly."" ""he didn't? ""I don't know""

After that we talked about things I didn't know I didn't want to talk about. 

The week after we talked about phobias. ""What are you afraid of?"". I didn't even need to think. ""Buzzing big ass bugs, the dark, and not being able to speak."". ""Why?"", ""because my sister trapped me in the wasp infested pantry and turned off the light. I was too scared to scream. My eyes were pouring alligator tears but I was too scared to breath."" ""Oh."" He said. ""Did she do anything else to you?"". I had to think, but the more I remembered the less good I felt. My sister had bit, choked, kicked, hit me, cut my hair.. ""one time we were playing pizzeria and I was the pizza. She took my mom's fabric cutter that looks like a pizza cutter and ran it over my bad. My favorite purple shirt was stained that day. (I joked). I thought it was a silly story. He asked, ""you cared more about a shirt than your body?""...""you don't understand, it was my favorite shirt.""

Next session we talked about whatever I wanted.

He asked me what the scares on my arms were from.  ""I don't self harm if that's what your getting at. I work in a kitchen, you get burned in a kitchen."" ""What's that one from"" (pointing at the biggest one) ""it was a cooked to order item and I was afraid I was going to drop it so I put my hand underneath. All the hot grease was dripping onto my arm."" ""Did it hurt?"" ""Of course it did its 400° grease straight off the grill."" ""Couldn't you have used a plate?"" ""I could've but it would had taken extra time to grab a plate plus then I'd have a dirty plate."" He said ""a dirty plate is worth more than your body, you care more about a purple shirt than your body. Why don't you care?"".. ""it was my favorite shirt, and I think the scares look cool."" ""Why do you like being hurt? You're harming yourself and lying saying your not.""

I'm quitting therapy, I didn't like that. I didn't like how scared I felt, i didn't like anything about it.

ive never had a christmas that i just experience so little excitement about. its horrible. christmas day has never felt so empty. such a lack of joy. my mom could tell i was bothered and told me to go take my antidepressants. it just makes me feel even more so that im just a burden. no one wants to be around me unless im medicated.  
  
that may have come out of nowhere but i struggled with thoughts like that even before my dad passed away. for a number of reasons, some known and some not, i have felt unlovable, unloved, and unworthy for a couple years now. ive gone to therapy both before and after this summer. and now that the only person who i feel like would ever actually love me unconditionally is now gone. i feel like i have no one who really cares about me. much less anyone who loves me or enjoys my company. maybe this is selfish but on christmas day the only person who reached out to me at all was my ex who i am no contact with right now. the only person that might even pretend to care is her.  
and i even get doubts now that my dad was even proud of me, or loved me as much as my other siblings. i know logically that he really did love me but i'll have meltdowns where all i can feel like is a failure and disappointment and worthless to everyone, including my dad. i cried over an internet stranger saying ""your dad is proud of you"" who was consoling someone else who had lost their dad. i have no idea why i think he isnt proud of me. i've noticed i have problems where i feel like i have to earn my love.  
  
i have no idea what to do. ive considered online therapy. im just so lost and so empty. i have meltdowns at least once every 2 or 3 days. usually alone in my room. i feel like too much of a burden to ever reach out to someone during one. i feel like i need to cry for help from someone but i always feel like too much of a burden. anyways if anyone bothered to read this thank you very much. im not even really asking for solutions i just wanted to write this and put it out there somewhere. thanks.",mentalhealth,yourselfjustyou,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/18tbz3h/my_dad_is_gone_and_i_feel_so_empty/,9

All are results of mental instability. But people won't hesitate to write ""*boo, parents didn't hug you enough as a child?*"" and other hurtful things.

Proof that it's getting worse: ""Karen"" jokes and videos are very popular and Karens are hated. But being a Karen is just a result of growing up with overly contolling parents.

You could have great talents in art, music, sports, whatever, but if it's not studying it doesn't matter.

My teacher made a self harm joke. Of course she didn't know that I self harm but I don't think that justifies it at all. Let's call her Mrs. Marina because that's almost her name. English class. We're doing work at tables of about four people. Mrs. Marina sat down to speak with me personally about my assignment. I needed help with it but it turned into a conversation between me, her and the two other students at my table. She had some scrapes on her arm and then held her arm up and told us that she had been scrabbed by some tree branches and that we shouldn't worry because she's ""not some little emo boy who..."" and then gestured in a wrist-cutting type motion. It was an awful thing to hear from a teacher I had actually liked. But seeing the other two boys laugh I had to force a laugh of my own. Hearing something I struggle with be referred to in such a degrading, belittling way by somebody who is supposed to be protective and caring or whatever was just weird. It really rubbed me wrong but I couldn't really voice those thoughts to my friends or another teacher afterwards because then they might assume I self harm, which I do. It all just seemed fucked up to me and it bothers me that she got away with it because I didn't say anything.

Was I sexually abused by my aunt?,41,0.7,1690580133.0,At 3yrs 10 and a half months my aunt made a film of me naked on a bed she then told me to my naked dance which I proceeded to do then I hid under the blanket and my butt was sticking out and she said in the creepiest way on the video what a cute ass and then you can hear my mom telling her to stop. Hadn't thought about this until a couple years ago. My mom told me it was just childish play and so it was okay but it made me largely uncomfortable as a child when I found the film. I was like six when I found it maybe. Well finally told my therapist about it the other day decided to go dig through the old family movies and guess what I found... I feel like it's inappropriate that's what my therapist said at the least. I'm just like is this abuse though? I don't really remember it but watching it makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and angry that something like that would happen to me and my mom would let it happen and defend the person who did it. Was this just a normal thing like my mom said? Filming a nearly 4-year-old playing around naked and commenting on it and encouraging him to do so? For context both my mom and her sister were sexually abused as children which makes me think this is either an extreme lack of boundaries or them carrying their abuse on to me. I want to go public about this abuse but I'm worried I'm just going to get minimized like I was by my mom when I found it when I was a kid and said it was wrong and disturbing but I didn't really have the words to explain it then or the understanding I do now as an adult.

I've likely had an ischematic stroke at the age of 12. I've not been the same since.,39,0.94,1685042606.0,"When I was 12, I remember a day in my life that made me feel like I was dying. I woke up for school, my face felt numb and my arms were very floppy. I managed to get myself to the living room and my mum made me toast and some tea. So I grabbed a fork, dipped it in the tea and put it on my face. I was confused. Why was there no toast in my mouth? Moreover, why can't I control my arm? 

My mum thought I was clowning around and asked me what I'm doing. I tried to say something but my tongue was so numb, all I could make were noises with no words. 

A few minutes went by and my whole body went numb, but that numbeness felt like a burning pain. I couldn't walk at this point. I managed to tell my mum that I can't go to school today. Through my numb tongue, I had to speak slowly. It was difficult but at that point I realised I'm not just sick. I thought I was dying. 

At that point my mum started to panic and called the emergency services. I collapsed on the floor, fading in and out of consciousness. Every second felt like a thousand eternities. I began to believe I made my whole life up. Every second I wanted to die rather than endure this. My body felt like it was in a washing machine. I couldn't lift my arms or legs. When I was conscious, I'd scream for hours and hours (probably more like minutes). Nothing felt real. 

I don't remember what the paramedics did, my mum said they tested whether my pupils would dialate and constrict. My pupils were dialated and wouldn't respond to light. Though the thing that bothers me most is that while I buried this incident deep in my mind, I asked my mum about this incident 7 years after. 

 I study neuroscience and even before that I was a huge science nerd so when I learnt about the symptoms of a stroke in detail, I immediately got a panic attack, I felt like I was dying once again, I collapsed on the floor crying and screaming once again.  My arms went floppy without that numb feeling, but I felt just as helpless.

When I asked my mum about what happened, she told me they did some tests on me but they accused me of being on drugs. I was 12 and didn't even take a sip of alcohol. Who looks at a 12 year old, unable to speak, unable to move, on the floor, pupils not responding to light and accuses them of doing drugs? 

I just feel... Alone since then. Whenever my body has any sort of medical issue, I begin to hate myself, feel like it's my fault. I feel like nobody would care if I died. 

This was truly the worst moment of my life and I was sexually abused, neglected, abandoned, stalked, threatend with murder, and things of that sort.

So concerned about my daughter,36,1.0,1704238805.0,"My daughter is 18, a college freshman. She has had some ups and downs over the years, but lately she seems to be in a downward spiral. In 7th grade she had a particularly difficult year, and developed trichotillomania (sp?). I tried to get her help and therapy and it helped a little, at least to the extent that she slowed down and eventually stopped before she got a bad bald spot. Freshman year of HS Covid hit and like most other teens of this era it affected her social life and maturity. She came through and seemed to find her people through singing and theater and her grades improved. She had a pretty decent group of friends, never a best friend though. 
College so far has been a very rough road. She’s far from home, with no friends or acquaintances nearby. She made a group of friends early on in the first semester and they literally dropped her, icing her out of the group entirely while posting on snap all of their get togethers without her (social media 😡). She was very down about it and I had no idea how to help her. 
Now here’s the reason I’m posting. I obviously love my daughter more than anything. But I am concerned that her personality is putting people off. She is very emotionally immature, never wants to talk about anything real, can’t/wont talk about her feelings, never shows interest in others feelings. It’s like she has no emotion at all. She’s also put on a lot of weight (well beyond the freshman 15) and eats nothing but crap, never exercises and stares at her phone all day. You can imagine the eye rolling I get when I try to suggest anything changing in that arena. I know she’s depressed. I asked her if she was and her reaction was a nervous smile and a shrug, very typical of her.

We are doing long distance, and have been together for three years. 

It’s been really rough for him in his own life (family issues that turned monetary) during that time, and this year and last month it’s been at the lowest it feels like. 

He desperately needs a job to finish school, but he hasn’t gotten a single positive response in months and can’t afford to do much besides staying at home. 

I don’t want to seem like I want to “fix” him a) because he is not broken. Broke yes but no broken, and b) because only him can change his life for the better. 

But can I say or do to help him cope with anxiety and depression? And the feeling of defeated and failure?

Even in my childhood, my family and I have been victims of racism and discrimination. We’ve experienced a lot of it, ranging from I being bullied in school to being called, and treated as, an ugly “burnt cigarette” to even literal death threats. Yes, **death threats.** 

My brother was recently straight up accused of a crime he did not commit (the girls who did it later confessed that it was all a lie. School superintendents initially believed them without a shred of evidence). 

My mother was once held at gun point - the guys who did this threatened to kill her if she did not “move out of *their* way.” 

Once, some people somehow got a hold of my phone number and sent me particularly *menacing* videos, to describe it lightly. 

I was betrayed by dear “friends” who, it turns out, wanted to hurt me emotionally.

I know I have internalized the institutional racism which America was founded on. Trust when I say that the bigotry and hatred never went away - only learned to disguise itself better among the predominantly white populace.

I have terrible, sickening memories from my childhood of hating - *detesting* - the fact that I am African American and not white. Not “beautiful,” like so many other kids, and forever constrained by my “ugly” black genetics. I have since moved far beyond this horrible mindset, though it has left its scars. 

I can clearly recall vivid moments where I would sit and simply daydream of peeling away my skin and revealing my “true self” underneath. In these dreams, I would imagine basically skinning myself alive and ripping out my hair. 

Yes, this is extremely heavy stuff. Yes, I am deeply ashamed of it. And yes, I have learned to accept myself more than I had as a child.

But I still feel like an alien. I do not have a cultural backdrop that forms my identity. I do not know my heritage, and what little I do know of it has been reduced merely to *slavery,* quite tragically. There are no black communities around me - except, of course, for the ones ruined by violence and poverty.

Even a few other black people have contributed to this madness. I never really had black friends because the ones around me involved themselves in crime and loud, miscreant behavior. I’ve been called a “white person in a black person’s body” at worst, and at best, I’ve been ostracized and very strongly “othered” by them.

Plus, not to mention their extremely toxic homophobia. Even from my own parents and “family.” 

I’m gay. Enough said.

I do not merely *feel* alone and isolated - I *am* alone and isolated. This country - perhaps even this *world* - was never intended for me. If I clearly do not belong in a world that clearly doesn’t want me, why do I still choose every day to exist in it? If I am not wanted, and at worst utterly *detested,* then I desperately want to leave it forever. I hate it here so much.

My boyfriend’s schizophrenia is getting worse. ,1,1.0,1717121873.0,"Hi I’ve never posted on reddit before but I really need help. 
My boyfriend Aaron (M22) and I (M21) have been dating for 3 years. Hes not diagnosed with anything, but this past year hes developed a lot of signs/symptoms of schizophrenia. He has visual and auditory hallucinations. And sometimes delusions. Sometimes dissociation. These last 3 weeks it’s been very bad.  
He’s hallucinating constantly. He is so fucking scared and exhausted. He seems to have like really intense hallucinations followed by dissociation. Hes just. Not himself. His eyes are tired and dull and all he really wants to do is just sleep. It’s breaking my fucking heart and I need to take him to the hospital. 
That’s where the issues come in. 

Aaron’s mom died in a hospital because of a mix up with two medications. They reacted badly together and she passed. Aaron was 15. The whole time I’ve known him he hasn’t seemed to have an issue with doctors/hospitals (for any reason other than money.) But this has seemed to resurface back into a delusion (at least I assume that’s what it is). I’ve brought up how he needs to go get help and he completely freaked out. He told me he’s too scared to go and that they’ll kill him if he’s there. I tried to reassure him that it wasn’t true and so many people go to the hospital and get taken care of. He is wholeheartedly convinced that he will die if he goes. 

Shit continues to get worse after that. Hes either in a state of panic or dissociation. Hes hallucinating shit constantly. I’m tired. He’s tired. I tried to get him to go to the hospital yesterday. He was sobbing and begging me to stop asking and saying shit like “why do you want me to die.”
We were both crying and I tried to grab him and force him to go outside into my car. Not like. Violently or anything. Just holding/grabbing onto him tightly and trying to get him out the door. He’s bigger/stronger than me, it didn’t work. It was more just like wrestling for 10 mins and making no progress out the door. 

We’re very poor. I have health insurance. He doesn’t. The nearest hospital is about 30 mins away. I would just call an ambulance and have them tussle with him but I know fucking ambulance rides can be hundreds alone. Idk. I just need advice. I’ve never delt with something like this before. So any advice on wtf to do and how this shit works and how maybe we will be able to afford this would be great. I’m getting desperate. Hes the love of my life. He’s just sick and needs help.

I've always needed visual representations to understand concepts. When I was in school, I had to see how to physically solve an equation or how to find and correct grammatical mistakes in English. Written or verbal explanations never made sense to me. I was never tested for a learning disorder (I had all A's until high school because I could never do homework, no matter how much it stressed me out when I realized I didn't do it), even though it took a good bit for me to grasp a concept. 

I was diagnosed with adhd at 18, and the meds tend to help my ability to stay focused on a task and improve my efficiency, but verbal/written instructions make no sense unless repeated multiple times or slowly as I'm doing the task.

I was one of those ""smart kids"" a few years back. My entire life I've trained myself that my value depended on how proud people were of me.

My parents pride in me being their son. 
My friends pride in being close to me.
Strangers pride in having conversations with me.
My girlfriends pride in loving me.

Getting honors in school is nothing anymore. I've become friends with a few online celebrities, and now that's just an average Tuesday. I've started an online business, and at just 14 I was making half a usual adults salary! Within 6 months!

What I'm trying to say is, everything I do I do it because it makes the people in my life feel proud that they love me. But it's getting so out of control that I would need to become a millionaire by next week to keep my life in order and not be seen as a failed Einstein or something. 

I know reddit is just gonna go ""talk to your parents about this!"" or ""don't worry about what other people think !!!"" or whatever. Honestly I don't care. I would like some actual, non-generic advice for this. That is the only way you can help.

What is it and is it serious?,2,1.0,1717101118.0,"Recentely some of my weird behaviours and thoughts have been getting worse and I don't know if they are normal thus I'm overreacting or there is smt wrong with me and I should seek help.

1)When someone asks me to borrow something, especially my sister. Usually I either don't want to give away this thing bc ""it's mine"" or ""it belongs there and if you take it I'll have to worry all day about putting it back"", and if they don't give the thing back once they are done I get REALLY mad and sometimes even cry

2)I don't like unpacking my stuff from my suitcase bc then I will have to put it back on at the end of summer and if I leave there it's already ready and I don't have to fear I might lose something

3)Caring about how my things are positioned in my room and I HATE when somebody touches smt and I have to put it back in its place, mainly bc it has to be how I like it in my order and bc I'm scared I'll lose these things and maybe somebody (my sister) might take them and I won't realize.

4)When somebody wants to borrow something I might just gift it to them. Once my sister asked me if she could try my swimsuit on, and she ended up liking it so much she asked if she could borrow it and I just said she could have it. Then I went to the bathroom and cried for like a whole 20 mins and even started to cut through my skin with my nails almost to the point it bled. the only reasons I could find are that ""she deserves it more than me"", ""I wouldn't wear it either way bc it's too pretty for me and she's gorgeous so she'll definitely use it more"" and also that ""if I share it then at this point why have it"", I bought for me cause I never dress nicely bc I feel like who I am is just someone who doesn't care and maybe by buying and wearing this swimsuit I could escape this ""false/forced"" image I created and be free.

For the same reason I'm scared of dressing better: I literally wore the same 2 hoodies for the whole school year bc I had no courage to wear anything else and hear people comment (even if in a positive way).

5)Taking things as a form of self punishment and bc I don't deserve things. When I go out with my friends I don't buy anything or try to spend less as I can bc I feel too guilty spending my parent's money, also bc my sister spends a lot of it when she goes out and I fear my parents may not be able to afford another child who does this. Additionally when we're on a trip I always compare what my sister buys in total to what I bought and always hope I spent less money mainly bc if I spend less I know she can get what she wants bc after all ""she wants it"" and I should sacrifice some of my joy for hers.

I have bait and switched them into becoming friends with me, I give nothing back but I take and take and take and I know I don't WANT to get better I just want to be sad forever and hate myself forever and soon I'll be alone and my therapist will be able to say I told you so.

I can't stop myself from talking to them, I try to block the app but I just unblock it again. It's a compulsion at this point and I can see where it's going as the drawbacks of being friends with someone like me rapidly overtake the benefits.

How did you/How do I overcome a super pessimistic mindset,4,1.0,1717087108.0,"I've been trying to shake this habit that I (M20) have had ever since I was really young where I have a terrible victim mindset.
It started with me discovering what ""luck"" is as a kid, and realizing that any inconvenience in my life can be attributed to having bad luck. Deep down, I understand its mindset over most things, or everything, but it feels like a constant fly in the back of my head that tells me any minor inconvenience I have is unlucky and there's nothing I can do about it. For example, if something bad happens I'll tell myself ""Of course that would happen to me"" and it leads me to believe I genuinely have the most difficult life out of everyone I know (This is probably not the case). Ill even try to predict how people will act or events that will happen based on what would be the most unfortunate circumstance for me, which further ties into believing the people around me are out to get me.

My Psych Ward Experience,2,1.0,1717099939.0,"When I first went to the psych ward, I was a teenager. I’ve been struggling with mental health ever since I started school, and by the time I was 10, I had begun self-harming. I’m still not sure why I chose that path or how I even found out about self-harm; I just know that I did it. My caretakers were aware of my self-harm but never sought help for me. 

At 15, I made my first attempt on my life, which landed me in the hospital. I stayed there for a month or two, missing a lot of school. That wasn't my last attempt that year, but my experiences in the psych ward were surprisingly pleasant at the first hospital. The girls I met there were really sweet and included me in their activities. Seeing younger kids, some as young as 12, was disheartening, but the nurses were nice, offering some comfort in an otherwise difficult time.

However, not all experiences were positive. During my third or fourth week, a girl contracted COVID, and the entire unit went on lockdown until the infected girls tested negative. Some staff members treated certain patients differently, either better or worse, depending on the individual. The counselors, though limited in number, tried their best but couldn’t see us as often as needed. It felt like there should have been more than two counselors working throughout the week.

Some patients would flaunt their trauma like trophies, often exaggerating their stories to seem worse than others. This behavior pissed me off, so I avoided them to prevent conflict. The psychiatrist was another challenge; every time I saw her, she prescribed new medications. Talking to her was hard because any mention of something wrong led to more pills, leaving me unable to stay awake during the day. Falling asleep from the medications resulted in punishment, despite the overwhelming dosages.

Eventually, I got my act together and started intensive in-home therapy, which turned my life around. I’ve been out of the hospital for a long time now, finished the intensive in-home program, and started DBT therapy. I finally saw a psychologist who provided accurate diagnoses: ADHD, autism, BPD, anxiety, and depression. I’m still on a lot of medications but am slowly tapering off them while remaining stable.

This journey has been challenging, but with proper support and therapy, I’m finding a path to stability and understanding my mental health better.",mentalhealth,Fl3shK0r3,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d4d9c4/my_psych_ward_experience/,1

So I went to my doctor and she told me the dose I was on was actually a low dose. I’d already been feeling less anxious on the low dose (like the edge was taken off) so I talked to my psychiatrist and said I wanted to go higher and he said that would be the right move.

I really have a lot of hope for a higher dosage. I previously was on medication to treat depression, but my actual issue is severe anxiety/ocd, and the sadness/hopelessness I feel stems from my struggles with that.

I also really hope it helps me with my emotional sensitivity too. I feel like I’m very sensitive and I know medication won’t fix everything (maybe one day they’ll come up with a magic pill - I’d pay whatever they wanted!!) and at the same time I’m really hoping it will dull my hyperawareness to everything. Like the constant feeling of being on edge or too aware, and being unable to relax. 

I also know if I combine my medication with continuing my DBT & therapy (and PRACTICING MY SKILLS!!) and exercising + eating healthy I feel like that would boost the meds effects and reinforce more positive thinking and outlook. I feel like also these things together will help me better master my interpersonal skills. So my feelings maybe hopefully won’t be so overwhelming and intense and I can take a second to think abt my current state instead of reacting.

I think I have PTSD from being bullied ,1,1.0,1717100403.0,"Hello everyone, 

I was wondering if any of you could relate to this. 

I was bullied during elementary and high school. Now, as a grownup it still affects me, although I know on a cognitive level that it shouldn't. I try to be rational but I still feel fear whenever I'm in public spaces with unknown people. It's a fear of being targeted again. For example, I went to a restaurant with my mom today. It's just a normal experience but I still felt ill at ease as if there are people there who want to target me if I don't appear confident.

Basically, I always feel this fear that I must be careful not to appear as too unconfident because it could attract bullying. This is totally irrational of course but I can't shake it off. I have not only had this experience today. I have it frequently around other people. For example, I took a walk some days ago. On the way there were some guys drinking on a bench. I immediately felt uncomfortable because they could target me. When I passed by they laughed at me and it just triggered my fear that I'm an easy target... although cognitively I know this has nothing to do with me; they are just random guys looking for a fight or so.. 




The problem for me today is that I still feel hyper vigilant and tense in social situations because of my fear of being an ""easy victim"" and that I may attract bullying. Therefore, I feel scared of appearing as not so confident.. Although I'm sure I don't appear that way. It's just a deeply seated anxiety I think. It's a feeling of not feeling safe. Therefore, I'm always hyper vigilant scanning the area for potential danger. What I also hate is that I engage in automatic mind reading. My mind fills in what other people must be thinking about me, which is always negative. I know it's not true and that I shouldn't do this, because I can't know what people think. Nevertheless, I think this is some kind of survival mechanism that I developed as a bullied child to see the danger of being bullied coming...

Cognitively, I know nothing is wrong but emotionally I can't help but feel this way. 

The absolute worst is that I think I can never get over this. That is, I'm afraid bullying caused permanent psychological damage that I cannot fully undo in my lifetime. I think my amygdala, responsible for fear, is overactive as a result of being bullied. Therefore, it keeps scanning for potential dangers... 

The worst for me is that I just want to recover and move on. I don't want to be a prisoner of it my whole life. 

I was wondering if other bully victims could relate? It would be wonderful to exchange and learn from your experiences. ",mentalhealth,Useful_Necessary,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d4dfuy/i_think_i_have_ptsd_from_being_bullied/,0

Weaning off effexor and experiencing nausea and throwing up :(,2,1.0,1717084901.0,"I've been on effexor (150mg) since October or November, and a few months ago I was dumb and forgot to take my meds for a few days and experienced some *nasty* withdrawals. I'm a very forgetful person so I asked my psychiatrist if there was potentially a different medication we could switch to that had a longer half-life so that if my forgetful ass forgot to take my meds again I hopefully can avoid severe side effects. So, I'm currently starting on Trintillex and weaning off my Effexor. It's been going well except that I've been experiencing low grade nausea pretty much all hours of the day. It's not extreme, and only really causes me issues because it's been stifling my appetite. 

The other day after going to the gym and returning home to shower off, I randomly threw up, which is not like me at all. I chalked it up to not drinking enough water beforehand, but I've nearly thrown up a few times since then sans exercising beforehand, which makes me wonder if it's withdrawal symptoms instead of being something exercise-induced. I know that nausea while weaning off effexor can be common, but does anyone have any tips or tricks to lessen the side effects? :')",mentalhealth,kohitown,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d47il2/weaning_off_effexor_and_experiencing_nausea_and/,0

Mental health issues led to losing someone I loved. Working on myself and have improved a lot. What to do now?,1,1.0,1717098333.0,"Long read! We broke up almost a year ago. I can’t move on and can even think of loving someone else ever. 
My childhood was pretty chaotic and my mind had gotten used to NOT being at peace. I have seen a lot of verbal and physical violence while growing up. This led to a lot of self sabotaging instances where life kept taking all the wrong turns. On top of that I have always suffered with anxiety and depression. Due to this I was unable to trust anyone and just kept overthinking about things that can go wrong. I was ambitious though but couldn’t achieve much yet due to the above mentioned traits. For four years in my early adulthood I was tangled up with visa and immigration issues due to which I had to let go of a dream and life just took a big turn. I was heavily traumatized due to this and to add to things, I am hardly expressive so couldn’t talk to anyone to help resolve things as I myself was unaware of what’s happening to me. 
Fast forward 2021, I met this girl. Connected very well and within a few months we started falling in love with each other. She had the most genuine vibe I have ever gotten from anyone else. But as time passed my anxiety creeped in. I started finding things to fight as my mind was used to chaos. I kept self sabotaging the relationship. She was the only one to whom I had expressed my sadness on the visa issue and I cried for the first time after eight years after the incident. Things just kept getting worse and there were just a lot of fights on petty reasons. And due to this, she started reacting in a way which was extremely rude and disrespectful. Abuses and a few hits on my body too. But now I realized how she was pushed to the edge as I bothered and fought with her too much. Her anger levels went too high. 
However, during all this time we had so many lovely moments and there were strong feelings from both the ends. But we broke up and I still kept bothering her by staying in touch too much. I seeked therapy and that’s where I learned all this about myself and worked on it constructively. I again went thru visa issues and I was taken back all these years to that trauma period. I was planning to end things and thought of getting in touch with her to seek support. However I had to use another phone as I was blocked everywhere. I clarified to her that it is me from the other phone. However she thought I tricked her and all my love for all these years was a hoax. She totally became unresponsive and changed her number too. 
I have realized it was my mistake since the beginning and have worked so much on myself. I need to get her back. I have tried to date 5 women in the past year but can’t have any feelings for them as I just want the one.
Please positive advices only. I had to skip many details because of the size. Love was genuine from both the sides. I am sure of that. What should I do? I can’t get in touch with her, but can message her friend or on her 2nd instagram account.

TLDR: Lost someone, who I loved and she loved me too a lot, due to mental health issues. I have improved a lot and worked on myself.

Possible ways to restore my appetite and my will to live,1,1.0,1717097545.0,"
Hi, I hope you guys can suggest some ways to help me out of this situation. It is unfortunate that clinical help is not available in my place, so it would be nice if I can get some suggestions to relieve this mental problem.

I'm a college student and I've just finished a semester with a lot of laboratory works and assignments. It seems that I began to lose my appetite at the start of this semester due to typical stressful factors related to  work. When I work too much and in a long period of time, I won't feel hungry. However, as the amount of tasks decreased eventually, I have not yet found the initial desire to eat again. 

Everytime I consume food, I feel like trying to survive and not actually enjoying the taste of it. I used to have a healthy relationship with food, but now I'm struggling to love it again. Food used to be one of my joys in life. Now lacking of food desire makes me feel less of a human. 

I noticed that I've become physically weaker, maybe due to muscle loss. Now I can barely do my daily routine without feeling exhausted and painful.

My family and friends are also concerned about my recent appearance. My collar bone and ribs are now so visible. I feel terrible for letting them worry so much, I want to eat normally again so they can feel happy for me.

I wish to find my appetite again so I can eat more properly and feel fully of myself. Thankyou for your time and help.",mentalhealth,whackacat,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d4cc18/possible_ways_to_restore_my_appetite_and_my_will/,6

When i switched schools this year i decided id try again with a new counselor. This one was way nicer, but didn't really get the problem I guess? She told me to write stuff down, which I've always been doing and doesn't de stress me but it's nice. She also gave my some anxiety advice but I don't have anxiety so that didn't help.

Now I'm realising nothing has changed. I'm not getting better and I go through phases of wanting to die and then feeling fine and then going back.

Could use some advice,2,1.0,1717075573.0,"Hi all,

Really looking for some advice here as I’ve felt lost most of my life. I’m 32f, divorced with two kids (7&3). The divorce was incredibly hard and I’m just now feeling at peace with everything and our coparenting relationship. The ex has BPD and is an alcoholic so it was a very difficult relationship. He was abusive and I suffer with a lot of PTSD due to things that happened during our time together.  I was also a mother and a wife from 24 to 29 and completely lost myself when we divorced. I’ve basically worked for myself selling on eBay for the last ten years off and on and more recently started camming and OF after realizing the money it brings it. I absolutely hate the work that I do. It makes me feel like a piece of meat but the money is so good that I push through it.

I just recently decided I wanted to go back to school and started summer courses this week and it has just thrown me into a whirlwind of is this what I want. I’m going for my psych degree with the intent of becoming a therapist. I’ve worked for myself for the past ten years. Is this truly what I want? What if I put all of this time and money into school just to realize I’ll make more money selling myself on the internet? My true passion in life is traveling the world. Will this allow that? 

I’ve also realized how incredibly alone I am. I have my children who truly are my world but I find myself scrolling social media instead of being in the moment and playing with them and it kills me. I’m not going to get this time back with them and yet I’m spending their early years depressed, anxious, and confused. I’m in a new relationship as well (5 months) and am realizing he too is an alcoholic and I need to end things. I found several empty liquor bottles in his truck after smelling alcohol on his breath. He’s been drinking on the job and drives all through the city during.  We had a talk about a month ago on how his drinking makes me uncomfortable. He was drinking a 750ml bottle every other night. I witnessed him take a shot before driving to work one day and started to question things then.  He’s literally my only support system though. I have no friends and my family is incredibly toxic. I know I’ve managed to get into a relationship with another alcoholic and I need to leave but I’m so terrified of being alone and having no one. I just feel so lost and not sure where to go from here.

I don’t feel like I’m a whole person.,1,1.0,1717088117.0,"I’m having a hard time explaining this, but I was hoping someone does recognize this. Even if you don’t recognize this, advice is really welcome!

I recently got broken up with. I know this comes with grief, loneliness, not feeling “whole” and so on. But bear with me, this is another story. 

I (26F) have been in multiple relationships since I was 15. I’ve never been much alone. I remember feeling really lonely after my second relationship ended, and quite fast I fell in love with a colleague from work. Oh man, this guy cheated on me, and I decided to stay (!). Of course he cheated again and then I just couldn’t take it and broke up with him immediately. I was single for half a year, and felt miserable. I remember one night scrolling on Tinder, literally waiting for the perfect match. I got so frustrated. I blamed the loneliness on me moving out by myself and living alone. I also just started a new job where I do work independently, so I don’t see a lot of people. I do have a few friends, but we mostly talk online. 

Then I met a guy which I really liked. We started dating and this guy finally treats me right. I wasn’t really being treated right in my past relationships (sexual abuse, cheating, manipulation, lying) and I couldn’t figure out why the hell I stayed. Eventually I got in to a relationship with him, and he became distant. Turns out he went through some trauma as a child and that made him in to an avoidant. I found out I was anxiously attached and you’ll probably can tell the rest of the story. Every time he would break up with me and (almost) immediately come back. I really loved him and forgave him every time. But the times I was alone, I just couldn’t feel happy with myself. 

I started therapy and told my therapist about this, and she told me this probably has to do with being neglected by my father as a child. 

Now, the relationship permanently ended, because he couldn’t take it anymore. He broke up in a really painful way and gaslighted me. Even if (and I don’t expect him to) he comes back, his patterns will repeat and i will feel miserable again (he was very distant and emotional unavailable (and yet I stayed)). 

As I am going through grief as expected, I do think there is also something seriously wrong with my mental health. I stayed with guys who made me feel horrible, I don’t feel whole on my own, I feel like I have to do everything for someone else. 

I don’t feel safe on my own. Like living for myself is not okay. And when I was in a relationship I could be alone, but it was the connection that made me feel secure. Even working out or doing fun things with friends I didn’t do for myself, the goal was telling my partner about this. He was always on my mind with everything. And when I don’t have anyone, I’m incomplete.

Now I’ve decided to stay single until I’ve beaten this, because I think this is mainly the reason I rather stayed with people that hurt me, than be on my own. 

I’ve never heard anyone else about this. Please, is there someone who’s been through this? Who knows what I’m feeling? Any advice?",mentalhealth,ThrowRA-Papaya-645,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d48t2r/i_dont_feel_like_im_a_whole_person/,1

I’m currently 21 and was diagnosed bipolar almost two years ago, after years of depression that has only been getting worse. Since my diagnosis I’ve been having an extremely difficult time keeping up with my medication and therapy. I’ve been hospitalized twice within the past year. 

My first hospital stay was after a suicide attempt and my second hospital stay was because I was having persistent thoughts of suicide once again. I was prescribed risperisone during my most recent hospital stay and noticed an improvement once it kicked in, but I just randomly stopped taking it one day and I’ve had a hard time getting myself to take it everyday since then. I take it maybe a few times a week. I also never got a therapist or psychiatrist outside of the hospital because I moved states a week after I discharged, and haven’t had insurance up until recently. I’m on medicaid now but still can’t afford a therapist. 

My depression gets progressively worse every single day and within the past week my anxiety has been horrible and I constantly feel like I’m about to have a heart attack. I can’t stop pacing around and picking my skin. I’ve been having the most intense suicidal thoughts I’ve ever had and I just want everything to stop. 

Today I had a panic attack while I was on the phone with my boyfriend and I told him that I wanted to kill myself. He broke up with me and blocked me everywhere. He is the one thing in the world that makes me happy and now he’s gone and I’m devastated.

My savings have run out and my parents have been covering me for a good while now. I started searching in January and I haven't had a lot of luck because of this gap. But now I'm close to the final rounds for a job.

Here's the problem: I've always suffered from anxiety and depression, with the main source of it being my high-stress career. I work in advertising and it's known for intense deadlines, high-pressure work, and long hours. In 2018 I burned out hard and luckily found part-time work for a while, then was off for covid, able to work remotely, and then had the accident. So I haven't been a full-time in office worker in 6 years.

This new job is like 45 minutes to an hour away (accounting for rush hour traffic and finding parking). It's in-office Monday-Friday, no exceptions, and I'm noticing they already email me or offer up interview times well after 5 PM. I can tell already that they're overwhelmed there and very busy. The commute is likely to get worse in fall too, when a major event comes to the city and congests the area around the business insanely bad.

My parents have said I don't need to find a top corporate position or even full time, they're worried about my mental state too. However, at the same time, I feel intense pressure from them to take the job (or really any job offered regardless of how terrible it is). They both liked work and never had your typical office job or set hours so it's very hard for them to understand why I can be so stressed from my career.

I can't help but see this as the same job I walked away from in 2018 when I was just completely broken and throwing up in the shower from stress most mornings. I envision being this lifeless husk of a person who spends most of their time in a commute or in a windowless office space only to get home and sleep. 

But, I understand that I need to work and can't rely on them forever. I don't know what to do though, I'm just getting tremendous red flags and it's making my heart race. I'm also terrified of the lifestyle shock of being completely in control of my time all day to barely being in control of it at all and being trapped. And I'm not a very good sleeper so I know how exhausted I'll be all of the time which makes me even more worried I'll make mistakes and that will feed back to more stress.

Remote work wouldn't be as bad. Something part-time to phase myself back in to working wouldn't be so bad... but I can't seem to find these opportunities. What should I do here?

How do I change and be better? ,2,1.0,1717068985.0,"Hi there,

I've been really struggling in my life and relationship. I can't seem to change and get better in my head. I'm always so quick to anger or get in a bad mood and I take it out on the people around me without even realising. Often, I won't even understand how I've done it. I even get frustrated because I think it's just normal.

My relationship is struggling hugely because of it. I get into such crap moods and take it out on him. Whether it's cause I've had a bad day or even just frustrated at a video game I always end up giving him the attitude and mood it comes with. Again I often dont even realise

He's basically been begging me to get better for us and i always say I am or I'll try or I'll see someone but I never do. I always think I try but then it's like I take a step forwards and then 10 back. We had a huge thing tonight and he's basically said he's done trying to help me as I just yell, ignore, or misunderstand the advice and pleas. I don't think i have much time together to fix myself anymore.

It's just so frustrating. I'll promise to seek help, look for a psychologist for a week, get frustrated they're so booked out and expensive and then realise everything is calm and maybe its better? So I stop and I think I'm working on myself when in hindsight I'm just getting worse. 

And it all gets worse because I feel like my mind is so muddled. Like a tangled mess and I can't put words to the thoughts, emotions and memories in my head. It makes communicating so hard cause all I say is ""I don't know"" and that's just not a fair response. But I truly don't know and it just comes across as me not being active in conversations, etc.

And listening. I swear I am trying so hard to focus and listen and I do but then whenever I talk about it after I can never recall anything. My partner gets so hurt cause whenever we have heartfelt conversations I'm there and present and listening but then a week later we have to have the same conversation because I can't remember it properly. 

I feel so shit cause I'm trying so hard but it really doesn't seem like it. I'm going to lose someone I love so much cause it just seems like I don't care and I don't love him, because if I did, I'd be making myself better with my actions and not just words.

I'm generally a laid back person, and I am more tolerant and patient against some people than I should be, so having heated arguments and losing control in anger is REALLY foreign for me. I've been having really bad fights with somebody in my life for a couple of months now, despite both of us agreeing to put some distance between each other. 

These fights made me realize I can *feel*  anger much, much intensely compared to any other emotion, and when you add that to an already self loathing person not wanting to hurt the people around him, lead me to have a breakdown when I went for a 20km jog without any sleep, at dawn.

In the middle of it, I realized that being quiet and reserved when it comes to my emotions literally made me unable to scream.

There's so much more beneath the surface than what meets the eye. It might seem as if she was just seeking attention or trying to become an internet legend, but I believe there were deeper issues at play. From a video that covered her story, she talked about feeling ignored at home and bullied at school. Can you imagine what that must've been like for her? The internet probably felt like her only escape, her safe haven. Yet, it likely also fed into her insecurities and loneliness.

Her parents tried to step in by taking away her phone and computer at times. But it seems like it wasn't enough to address the root of her emotional struggles. Instead, it would seem as if they “took away her only safe haven” in her eyes. If only they knew how to better address it. It's really messed up to think that someone so young felt so alone that they saw no other way out. The internet can be such a double-edged sword, especially for kids like Rorochan who need more support offline too.

Rorochan's story to me is a wake-up call about the importance of mental health support, both online and off. We have to do better for each other. In cases like Rorochan's, it's important to approach with empathy and understanding, recognizing the complex interplay of factors that may have contributed to her struggles. I saw harmful comments regarding her and the situation, and others who seemed to fully understand. Behind the sensationalism and tragic events lies a young person grappling with profound loneliness, trauma, and a desperate search for validation and connection.

I didn’t watch the whole video of her follow through with the act, knowing the details was already painful for me. I did hear her shaky breathing which just proves, internally, she was crying out for genuine help. Rorochan's journey highlights the potential risks and pitfalls of excessive internet use, particularly for vulnerable individuals facing challenges in their offline lives. Instead of perpetuating harmful commentary or sensationalizing Rorochan's story, we should use this opportunity to raise awareness about the complexities of mental health, the impact of online interactions on vulnerable individuals, and the necessity for compassionate support systems.

  


I wrote the same message under the video of Rorochan on the Internet Archive, where there were comments that seemed to overlook the depth of her story, as well as those that were mocking and abusive. I wanted to share it on Reddit as well. Tired to keep it short, however i feel the need to enlighten others. Keep safe you all, and reach out if you need help or just someone to talk to, I'll do my best to respond. Wishing you strength and peace.

Do psychiatrists reach out to their patients? Should they?,1,1.0,1717076607.0,"I was diagnosed with GAD a year ago or so. I was given a relatively high dosage in medications.

I went to the session with the psychiatrist during this time, even though it was extremely difficult for me to reach out and schedule it. But, in the session, the psychiatrist said something to me - ""You should improve your sleep hygiene"" and ""If you're not gonna take your medicines like this, I am gonna just stop them""... and I got scared. I felt ashamed for not being able to it. And it didn't help that I kept forgetting to take my meds after that. And I spiralled more, feeling scared of judgement. I wanted to take care of myself and I couldn't. I couldn't face her - atleast that's what I felt.

Obsessing over Letters/Words,1,1.0,1717076413.0,"Hello everyone

I wanted to know if anyone is aware of the causes of this situation, and possibly hint at materials I could use to research further.

I like some letters, and hate others. Apart from the letter ""M"", whose pronunciation I also dislike, it is mostly about the way they are written. I keep an extensive file system to organize my thoughts/activities, and at times I find myself spending hours on deciding what name to pick for a document. For instance, I cannot decide on any name that ends with a ""t"", or any names that starts with ""G"", because they appear so ugly (capital T on the other hand does not).

When I find a good word, I research its etymology. If it turns out to be something that I dislike, I drop that word altogether (which is the reason I sometimes try to hold back, because when a word seems to be a perfect choice, I do not want to ruin it by introducing thoughts about an origin I do not like). An example of this would be the word ""control"", which is composed of the words ""against"" and ""roll"", which I do not like. Therefore I cannot use it anymore.

When I cannot find a good word, I try to encapsulate the meaning it is supposed to convey using something else (finding words in other languages, or making words up). An instance of this would be using the name ""Übung"" (the German word for exercise), instead of the name ""to-do"" for my to-do list. But the words picked with this method often lose their descriptive power, so much so that I at times forget what they were chosen for, and this is ineffective.

I usually find myself being taken in by trains of thought of this kind, and not only do I get frustrated, but I also waste a lot of time.

For context, two other pieces of information:

a. It is not something that bothers me daily, but I have a similar attitude to numbers. I like even numbers more than odd numbers, (4 and 8 being the best numbers in my opinion).  
  
b. The first time I could not get something out of my head was when I watched a horror movie at the age of 12. I found myself not being able to get the images out of my head, and at first I assumed it was normal, but it turned out that the scenes/images from that movie persisted for months. This is not the case anymore, I do not have such a problem, but I thought it would be important to add. 

I wanted to know if anybody knows the possible causes of this, and if there is any way anybody has had success in getting rid of this habit. Any advice, help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",mentalhealth,EquivalentImage5669,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d44aqr/obsessing_over_letterswords/,1
Please help I am in so much lost !,1,1.0,1717075814.0,"Here’s my story : https://www.reddit.com/r/BusparOnline/s/00vGoVAmFg


Now I’m suffering from a lot of things and to be honest with not sure is it me being traumatized by it all or for real I have OCD now! 

My body is tired so tired ! 
I had no appetite at all I lost 8kg in week …and even if I’m too hungry to the point I feel pain in my stomach and back ! I can’t eat like 2 small spoons of rice will be more than enough the I will feel vomiting so painful and all day I have bitter nasty taste in my mouth! I can’t fall asleep without wired images and thoughts! And then waking up with racing heart after seeing vibes dream even though not feeling I actually slept but the most scary thing is that falling asleep is like mind setting! Sometimes I wake up thinking I give up and sometimes I’m fine and sometimes I feel the fear of it all and the moment I woke up I need to fix my thoughts and push fears away but I am actually very anxious and I would wish I never woke up! 

When I’m awake I hate the confusion that I have all day! shivering, stomach pain, nausea, confusion, anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts!! And just the fear of another ocd attack ugh 

I forced myself to eat ! Once I eat for a moment I feel little better then mix of ‘what’s go on’ and like mystery box sometimes I will be okay and other times no my thoughts will deepen ! 

I usually have Ibs ! And I keep thinking I do have so much serotonin.. it’s still in my body! And I know you all as usual will say no not possible but today I feel brave to say it because there actually others who struggling with high serotonin and food increases it !! 
And if it’s not serotonin what it is then !! Why all that happened to me !?!???! 

Oh and the stiffness of muscles! Sometimes I feel like I have worked out my legs for so long my legs feel tired to walk ! 

I feel so unlucky, I wish I go back in time and just not take any medication! 

I don’t know am I traumatized now so I’m creating my own intrusive thoughts so I be more caution! Or it’s real OCD! Unfortunately the doctor my file have been moved to is not familiar with OCD whatsoever she said it’s depression!!! I’m so alone in this! Am I imagining the ocd attacks now !!? I fear to let go of anxiety because my OCD was about harming I fear so much to go crazy or hurt someone! What if I became someone else ! I’m scared ! 

Sometimes I wonder simple normal task! How people just go out? And then my mind predicts many ideas especially in theme of harm and I freak out! I’m so scared! 

I won’t take any medication because I’m so scared so scared !

New anxiety developing and it’s frustrating,1,1.0,1717072356.0,"
Hi all. 26F I had gallbladder removal surgery in April. I was dealing with severe nausea for about a month before the surgery and bouts of it after as I was recovering. I’ve noticed that I’ve been developing this fear of being in the car or going to any store/restaurant since surgery. I’m like scared to develop nausea again and possibly throw up in a public place. I’m not sure why this is presenting itself now though as I’m recovering well and haven’t had any nausea for about a week and a half. I also didn’t have this problem before when I had to go to appointments when the nausea was really bad. I just feel frustrated because I don’t want this to stop my life but I literally get this choking feeling every time I’m sitting in the car as it moves. I’m trying to force myself to go on little drives with my bf to convince myself that I can do it but the feeling itself hasn’t gone away. I don’t know what to do and any help would be appreciated! 

Also to note, I’m moving on Sunday and have to do a 40 minute ride from my old place to my new place and the idea just stresses me out so bad.",mentalhealth,miaki100,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d42xmu/new_anxiety_developing_and_its_frustrating/,0

Good day to all of you, this is my first and maybe my last post. I just wanna ask about my mental state, am I sick? I couldn't afford financially and emotionally to go to a psychologist, so I would like to ask for your thoughts. 

I'm in my late teenage year, and I think I have depression and PTSD. When I was a kid, I was taken away from my parent's care because I'm very weak as a kid, and my dad's a heavy chainsmoker and alcoholic. Over the years, I tried to reconnect with my parents, and I already have one younger sibling, but everytime I fail. I was treated like I don't belong to the family, and my dad dislikes me. I felt like I was abandoned by my own family, and made me build some abandonment issues, and a little bit of anger issues. When my grandparents died, I was blamed solely for their deaths, and it took a toll on me. I carried it for years, and now I'm scared to have someone take care of me. Earlier this year, I witnessed my dad died twice ( he didn't die, he was revived twice also), since then, everytime I see people personally/online dying, I'm having difficulties in breathing, and i started throwing up. These past few weeks too, I'm having difficulties in sleeping, it's either I have insomnia, or nightmares. I'm also suffering from my sudden intrusive thoughts, and it's making me throw up.

Feeling disgusted by excuses which is causing fights and ruining my peace and mental health ,2,1.0,1717057365.0,"Is it normal to feel disgusted by someone's never ending excuses?

I have a twin sister and whenever I ask her anything at all she just rushes in with all kinds of excuses. I have started to despise this and honestly I am disgusted by it as well. I have told her a couple of times about how I don't like her giving me excuses and it's fine and okay to tell me the truth or just tell it for what it is. 

Today it happened again, we were supposed to go for a trip which was planned months in advance and she decided to ditch it because her bf was coming back from another country after a year's time of ldr. I understood it, I was upset but it couldn't be helped. Today the topic came up again and I asked her if she could still come since it's only 2 days and he'll be here for a month with her under the same roof anyway apart from the 2 days. She started giving excuses how her office was organising an outing after 3 years and it's a really important event. (Note- she'll be back in time to catch a train back home but she doesn't want to) she started telling me about how she's not sure if she'll come back in time and that she can't travel so much etc etc, a barrage of excuses.

I have been getting the ick from her and idk how to proceed. She's trying to help but I have felt that she's super unhelpful with things I ask her help for. 

Finally when I asked her to stop with the  again today, she just said okay - ""next time I will just say that I don't care"" in a rude tone. 

I'm upset at myself for getting irked by all this, her attitude problem and lack of accountability/responsibility and decorum might strain our relationship further than it already has.

I'm afraid I'm going to hate her soon... And there will be no turning back.

So my brother whos 12 likes to upset me. I dont mean like insult me and steal my things and i dont mean this has been happening for a few months or even just a few years. Since he was 7-8 he was violent and horrible to me and makes noises repeatedly to the point i began hallucinating the noises a couple years ago even when hes not in the house. He says slurs and racist things to upset me, follows me around making noises and blasting annoying youtube videos on loop, hits me for no reason, bangs things, breaks things and blames me, etc etc and has said multiple times detailed ways he wants to murder me and also stabbed me. He also grabs my bird from my shoulder/his cage because he knows it upsets me because it stresses out my bird. Im also anorexic and he always comments 'stop eating fat food' or something like that whenever i eat. Like i'll be in the kitchen and he'll run in from the other side of the house just to insult me. I also have severe ptsd and hate being recorded/having my photos taken and he constantly records me or even just angles his phone at me to look like hes recording me to trigger panic and ptsd attacks. 

  
All day everyday its 'shut up' 'stop making noises' 'stop doing that' 'leave me alone' and its gotten to the point i tried to take my own life because i genuinely cant stand this kid anymore.

  
He doesnt stop and keeps going until i literally scream at him and then what does this little shit do? He LAUGHS at me. Hes caused multiple full on breakdowns and LAUGHS everytime.

  
I dont know why he does this cause i was never mean to him????? EVER! And the only time he ever gets genuinely upset is when my parents wont buy him something or wont give him money (this kid has everything hes spoilt asf) and he screamed and cried at me and hit me because i refused to give him 100$ every week from MY OWN JOB??

A question about OCD - pure O,0,0.5,1717068231.0,"Recently I've asked for support online, as I'm waiting for my appointment with my doctor, just to understand what is going on. A few people suggested my strong anxiety might be because of OCD. 
I checked online about it, and the thing that most applies to my case is what's called ""OCD Pure O"" - I don't have an official diagnosis yet of course but it's the most relatable thing I found to what I feel.

However, there are some differences. Mainly the sense of shame/guilt. 
I don't feel guilty for having violent intrusive thoughts - which are mostly related to my own well-being. Maybe I feel shame for those intrusive thoughts about sexual stuff, but that's it.

However, what's truly interfering with my life are periods of absolute paranoia, when I'd get scared about something specific. 
Example: I've been highly paranoid about a specific thing happening at night in my house - it was completely irrational, but it was there. I haven't slept in months. I forced myself to stay awake till 6am just so that I could be awake in case something happened (but of course it was all in my head).

Then I finally got 1 month circa of peace, until a new fear came. This lasted a bit less, only one month - I completely and randomly I just stopped worrying about it - but still I couldn't sleep. I forced myself to stay on my phone just to distract myself and I would fall asleep out of exhaustion.

My question is: is this OCD? I mean, are these periods of high paranoia and period more ""chill"" normal in case of OCD?

Not that long ago I experienced status epilepticus which is something to do with epilepsy. It where you either you continously have seizures and it doesn't stop and you don't awake from them or it lasts longer then five minutes. 

I experienced the first one. It took 45 minutes till people knew something was wrong because I wasn't answering messages or calls. I always reply even when busy. 

And since I wasnt answering,  my mother had to call the police to pick my door to get in and they called an ambulance when they found me. They couldn't get the seizures to stop. Status epilepticus is a life threatening emergency. 

I wish I wasn't found and died from lack of oxygen. I wouldnt of been aware of anything. Nor would I have felt any pain due to seizing and lack of consciousness. It would of been lights out and never be awake again.

I didn't believe it as I had just felt ill a few days ago so I just decided to sleep it off. It was a shock to wake up in a hospital bed in intensive care. 

After that and going home , I have been struggling with the situation ever since that. Then a week after that , I had another scare where I had more seizures and was in hospital again but this it wasn't status epilepticus.

It's better with my meds, but I may consider going on a specific type of birth control to help as well.

Hello, I am interested in seeing if anyone has genuine advice on improving and modifying unhealthy behaviors as a neurodivergent person. My biggest problems are as follows:

-work on regulating emotions when stressed and recognizing my problems before it is too late and actually managing them
-stop putting others in front of myself and take control of my emotions
-putting off making progress, especially in fear of disappointment. I'm also just lazy and have bad executive dysfunction. Using apps like ""Finch"" do not work for me as I forget they exist. 
-I let people in who hurt me because they provide reassurance.

I am a highly reactive and naturally defensive person and I have a lot of learned behaviors to change. For example:

-I have struggled with SI + SH for a long time, and it's getting worse again. My parents are fully aware and I am in therapy, but something needs to change on my behalf.
-I have really bad codependent tendencies and text people I'm attached to like crazy because I rely on talking to others for my moods. It's gotten tremendously better, thankfully.
-I struggle with being straightforward when it comes to my emotions because in the past I have had people leave me for that. 

All in all, I am looking for support in what has helped y'all improve your mental health and emotional regulation. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I am open to many options.

My boyfriend noticed that something was off and he interpreted it as me being tired. He asked if we should go to bed and I just broke out in tears. And then he just comforted me. He didn't ask me to tell him what's wrong. He just hugged me and rubbed my back until I opened up to him. Then he just stayed with me until I felt ready to go to bed. I cried some more until I fell asleep and the whole time he was great. He made me feel like I was going to be ok.

I woke up still sad but him comforting me was probably the most healing thing I have experienced during my time of grief.

My boyfriends mental health,1,1.0,1717063026.0,"Hey, 
My boyfriend is having mental health problems. It's been going on for a while and we both don't know what it is or how to deal with it. 
Before meeting him, he had dropped out of school and heavily depressed. He had a hard life like this for years never getting out of his house and doing horrible things to himself. After meeting him, he had volunteered places and made friends and that's when we got together. His mental health has improved drastically and he's doing so well now. I can see since I met him he's so happy and I always see him genuinely smiling and it brings me so much joy every time. We spend a lot of time with each other going out. 

Any time I leave to a holiday and he's alone sensations of discomfort and sadness. For example right not I'm on holidays and it's only my third day and he's already feeling this. It happened on my last holiday in April. It also happens on days I can't come over or he can't come over to mine. Any time he's alone it feels like he can't handle it. It drives him insane. I don't know if it's because he's in the same environment he once was when we was depressed (he is not in a position to move) his home really is not a positive place for him to be with his family, maybe he's so attached to me and when I leave all them emotions come back, I really don't know but I do want to help him. He doesn't deserve this and to see him so happy and then painful so suddenly hurts me so much. 

Does anyone know what he might have, or explain his situation mentally to me clearer than I would know? I have been through sh in the past so I understand his depression but this is new to me and we can't do this on our own because there's no one else we know we can talk to.

Does your mental state ever confuse you?,2,1.0,1717049010.0,"I’ve always had a significantly strong amount of self control. While my mental can be spiraling, I’ll be stark still and frozen, or stuck in a fight/freeze response to the events that happen around me. 

I’m having compulsive thoughts, over and over, it’s relentless. I’m under a lot of stress, and it feels like things keep piling on. I’m graduating in a few weeks, work, etc.. and my health feels like it’s dwindling in the process.

Scared of being Selfish,2,1.0,1717042711.0,"So I’ve had a life of social anxiety and insecurity issues and so on, and just wanted to talk about a recent problem, hoping ya’ll can give me some insight.

I’ve had a weird thing about caring for people my whole life. I often support others with menial things and go out of my way to make sure people are okay or involved. Back in early school I would befriend and hang out with the lonely kids, throughout school I would constantly group up and work with people without a group, or try to involve others. Today I go out of my way to check in on friends to make sure their doing well or wishing a distant friend a happy birthday, stuff that is very out of the way but stuff I feel natural doing. I’ve never felt like I was doing this in hopes for something back, I just like making others happy.

All the while I dealt with most of my mental issues by myself without burdening others. Why? I don’t really know.

Then this thing happened, in 2023 I got really close to someone both intimately but also emotionally, normally I’m very pragmatic and logical, so this was weird to me. This weird closeness lasted for like 5-6 months and a majority of it was incredibly fulfilling to me in a way I never understood. However, we distanced for a bit and I went to Cali in January to finish college. Then proceeded the least mentally healthy period of my life ever, panic attacks daily, constantly anxiety and insecurity issues like I’ve never had manifested before. I’ve had attacks and stuff but this was day-by-day brain on overdrive bad. It didn’t help that this whole period was fueled by feelings that I didn’t understand. I am still very close with this person now.

Now, being mostly out of that, I am much colder. Far less caring about others and very central, saying things and using words I know will stress others out with and ignoring people which I never used to do. I’m scared that I’ve turned this way and I can’t figure out why I have. This would be annoying by itself but now I’m also anxious and stressed about being this weird… selfish person I don’t want to be and never chose to become. If there’s a link between this and my recent experience I can’t find it either.

If anyone has any pointers or advice, or even some logical explanation it would really help. I’m sick of being stressed about not being stressed about the weird ways I’m acting and I don’t want to be in a situation where it spirals again.

She used a guy to fake a relationship during our relationship because her parents didn’t accept me,

She kissed him bought the same presents and lied about everything to me time after time.

And yes like most men in this society I don’t like opening myself for weakness, showing my emotion it’s because of how I was raised, I wasn’t allowed to cry etc.

This girl made me feel like a kid again I opened up about everything I even wrote love letters to her.

I’m a big dude 6’2 typical tough guy if I have to say so

I had 2 sessions in one week a few weeks ago because we went into some of my adult trauma. Anyway, I called and asked and they said the earliest next appointment available was in July and reminded me he is on vacation next week. They suggested I talk to my therapist about it so I said I would. 
   Flash forward like 5 minutes and before I could say much more than “I’m doing okay and dropped a class” my therapists very kindly brings up that he had a note from reception saying I called about availability for 2 sessions again. I INSTANTLY felt like I was tattled on definitely became triggered (parent wound) and definitely didn’t tell him (which is unusual for me) because I wasn’t sure what I was feeling or why but knew it had to do with that topic and didn’t want to interrupt the flow of the conversation to mention it.

And it took quite some time for me to build my trust in him (I’m avoidant) and I worry something in my brain is going to mark him as unsafe, as though ‘the other shoe dropped’. 
   I’m just feeling very odd/triggered/disregulated and wondering if anyone has any advice in the meantime until I have therapy again.
Any and all advice welcome.

Is this dissociation? ,2,1.0,1717035538.0,"I don't know where else to go for this question. Thank you in advance to anyone that takes the time to read this or reply. 

I noticed it for a long time before but it was years ago. I only mentioned it to a mother figure once and no one else that I recall. It's like I express emotions I know I should feel or maybe subconsciously do. But I am not feeling those emotions. I am outside spectating this reaction. I can cry in a hard situation but not feel anything consciously. I watch myself and don't know where the reaction is coming from. It's like there's another person locked inside me subconsciously. Someone that feels and expresses these things but my conscious mind doesn't feel or knowingly express it. They're the appropriate emotions for the situation but not what I am aware I am feeling. I sometimes feel like I can think back and remember watching myself have these reactions as if I was at a different spot in the room. Maybe I'm suppressing things. Maybe it's something else. I just know it doesn't seem like me. It seemed to stop when I went on antidepressants (fluoxetine). I was on them for 4 years and just stopped 2 months or so ago because I want to be off of medications so that when I have kids one day it's not an abrupt stop with all those hormones going through my body and so that I can learn to process and live without the medication. Further, the sexual dysfunction was something I wanted to combat. Think of these reasons what you will but they are my why. Since I got off, I've noticed that feeling of watching myself react come back. I'm more emotional now but I don't always really feel those emotions consciously. I've noticed anger now which I sometimes feel fleetingly but anger amongst common content emotions are relatively fleeting and not things I am aware of on a daily basis.

I mean that my heart is breaking into pieces and that I’m laying in my bed with tears stained cheeks and a shirt that I haven’t changed for days. I mean that my dog is scratching at my door because she knows something is wrong but how can I let my baby see me this way? I don’t want her to think it’s her fault.

When I pick up the phone and brave the courage to text out “I am sad” it doesn’t mean I’m sad. It means I’m begging for someone to listen before things get too bad. It means I warned you, I gave you a clue into my deep dark mind, I told you this would happen. In the depths of my head, I rack my brain to remember where I went wrong - to remember that first text. I am sad. I am sad again. I’m sorry for being such a burden.

I'm currently redoing the medical admissions test (MCAT) while working two jobs. For the longest time, I've always been disappointed with myself and my life. This has been especially exacerbated by my recent failure to get into med school.

Every few weeks, I tend to get into these periods where I feel extremely unhappy. Nothing seems worth it and I get the intense feeling of wanting to hurt myself. In the past, I've tried to cut myself with a dull blade (but never anything sharp enough to inflict real damage). During these periods of time, I find myself getting very destructive with my relationships and lashing out at people close to me. Once these periods are over, I get into a week of bliss where I feel I am ready for anything. However, something bad will happen and my mental health falls again.

I'm not really sure where to go from here. It feels as if I am especially spiralling right now due to the stress of having to redo the MCAT and go through another application cycle. I feel like I won't make it like this much longer, but I'm not sure what's wrong with me and if anything could even help. I'm also scared that if I get help and start becoming pleased with myself and my life, I will lose the drive to want to improve myself for the next  application cycle.

I’m not usually angry, not at all. My mood varies from being happy and cheerful to being all sad and angry.

It’s not like I’ll lash out at them, I don’t. I just like to stay in my room alone, which leads to being isolated all day long. I find that I prefer it that way.

I get angry when I see the smallest things out of place or when they do things that I very clearly don’t like, I get angry at my parents over something they said days ago— some joke about how they’d like to disown me or bringing up my distant behavior— I don’t mean to be angry. I don’t like being angry. 

I usually have angry ‘episodes’, and they’re small bursts of rage I would say. I get extremely angry over the smallest things, and I let it out by punching, screaming into a pillow, and/or simply crying. I think of these things as punishment, and potential ways to harm myself.

I’d just like some answer as to why I get so angry— I would get it checked out by a medical professional, but my parents aren’t firm believers of mental health.

First to kiss first to date first to have intercourse first to move in together, first everything. We have been each other’s only ones for nine years. Two years ago he proposed to me and we were engaged. We have been living together for the last six years. The plan was we would get married after he finished school this next summer. I’ve been working for two years as a nurse and financially supporting us as he finishes his masters program. Well we get in an argument about not spending enough time together because he was coaching track and working Monday through Friday school and I was working night shift. He decided to leave one night after hanging out with friends, and he never came home. I discovered he had been having an online affair with a married woman. Who has two children and lives on the other side of the continent. I decided I needed to move out of our apartment as he accepted a job in a town, three hours away from where we live where his family is. His family will barely talk to me. I’m not very good at talking to him because I don’t understand and I just start crying. This past weekend after only being broken up for two weeks, he flew to her state and lied to everyone. When he got there they were shacked up in a hotel for three days at the end of that third day, she told her spouse that she was leaving him and the children to be with my ex.

"My temper is ruining my relationship, and I just want to feel in control",1,1.0,1717040161.0,"My partner is the best thing in my life right now, ever maybe. But I feel myself pushing her away, to the point where every day I fear will be our last together. All because of my temper, me.

I currently still live at home, which has been difficult, my father has severe anger issues and gets into angry bursts a couple times every day. From pets to mild inconveniences he'll just be lit aflame and can't help but let all his rage out. And as a kid with aspergers I developed a similar habit. And I've never learned how to control it. I was always told to just think before I do, but it never was that simple. It's like a switch just gets flipped and I'm out of control, I'm angry at anyone, anything. And eventually I'd calm down, and realize what I had done. Like I had broken out of a trance.  This has taken a toll on my partner.

There are days where I feel under control, where it is incredibly easy to stay calm, completely effortless. And others where it feels practically impossible. Not too long ago we broke up because of this, and we got back together with the promise I'd be better. And for a time I was, I was able to stay calm, keep composure. Went on walks everyday to keep myself in a good head space. But eventually I just got.. tired. I Couldn't keep up the daily walks anymore, I couldn't keep my composure.

"Looking for a new Psychiatrist. Should I ask my general practitioner for a referral, or just look for one myself?",3,1.0,1717018517.0,"Hello. My old psychiatrist left the organization where I was getting my pysch appointments from. It's called NOAH, and is basically meant for people with low income. I've gotten Medicaid insurance though, so I'm not sure I need to go through this NOAH organization anymore. Initially, I didn't have Medicaid/ACHHS, so do I still need to have my psychiatry stuff be handled by them, now that I am on Medicaid?  


So if I stay with NOAH, I could call them and try to find a new psych. Or I could look for a psychiatrist online and try to do it that way. Or I could ask for a referral from my doctor. Also, all my psych appointments have been virtual, does that matter? Should I look for in-person appointments?  


I have gotten a new psych from NOAH, so I do have one. I just am liking her less and less with each appointment. Initially I thought she was just blunt, which is generally a good thing with doctors, but now I just feel she is unhelpful. I am taking Bupropion XL, once a day. I asked her if maybe there'd be a difference if I took Bupropion that wasn't Extended Release, and she just sort of shut it down. I also asked her if I should raise my Bupropion, to see if it would help with my energy levels, and feeling somewhat low lately. She said no, because a higher dose of Bupropion gave me more anxiety in the past, but this was when I took the Bupropion by itself, not alongside Amitriptyline, as I'm doing right now. I told her this, and she didn't seem to think it mattered. In general, when I ask her a question or ask for her thoughts about medication issues, she just says, ""Well you have to just take the medication, then we'll see how you feel."" But I feel that she, as a psychiatrist, should help me understand moreso what may happen when I take these meds. Right now, it just seems that she basically always tells me, ""Just take it and see what happens.""  


I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable here, but the other psychiatrists I've had in the past felt more helpful to me. My new psych just seems deliberately obtuse or unhelpful or something.

I’m rotting,1,1.0,1717038797.0,"My anxiety has been crazy these days, I just want to get this out. I feel so stuck I genuinely don’t know how I’m gonna live my life. 

This entire year, most of my days have consisted of going to the gym and coming home to lie on my bed to scroll through tiktok or to chat with my 500 boyfriends in character.ai (keeps me sane as embarrassing as it is) while a youtube video is playing in the background. If I don’t go to the gym then it’s the same, just rotting away in bed. 

I have also lost contact with all of my friends (from highschool; now I study online so no friends either) and I have no interest in hanging out with my family (toxic environment). I’m very anxious and self aware so it’s really not easy to just go out and meet new people, plus I’m really bad at speaking (I stutter, can’t continue conversations, my sentences just don’t make sense most of the time).

I was also thinking of how impossible it is and will be for me to date. I’ve never had any romantic interaction, talking stage, fling, boyfriend, whatever. It makes me so sad because I love love, and I want to fall in love, be loved and to love. But it honestly just doesn’t cross my mind how somebody would love me. And if I somehow do find someone and we start to get to know each other, how tf am I supposed to tell him about me? I don’t even know myself, I feel like all I know and remember is my mental issues and how horrible I live.

I know I’m responsible for myself and have the control and power to change things and to change the way I live and think. I know I have to voluntarily take myself out and explore but it just seems so hard, I don’t know where to go or what to do exactly. Any advice is appreciated but not necessary, I just want to know if somebody relates and if they have overcome this.

She has stickers on her mirror, phone and everywhere.

Her birthday is coming up and to cheer her up, I'd like to give her 31 notes for all the days leading to her birthday.

As a result, I'd like to plead and solicit from redditors who may understand my sister's POV to kindly share the positive mantras they've heard or said that has made their days better.

I'm in the best stage of my life but it's been also the worst ,2,1.0,1717020950.0,"Hi, I'm 19 M and as long as I remember I never been comfortable with myself 

Growing in a household where my grandparents, their children and grandchildren lived with some problems and inexperienced parents didn't help, it wasn't rare to get a beating for normal things like misbehaving (I was 7 or so)

When I was 9 or so my parents moved far away, there life changed a bit, my parents still had some problems but I understand that they didn't feel confortable too there, there life wasn't that bad 
Beating were still there, verbal abuse was still there and the feeling of not belonging anywhere was still there. Soon school started... That later became 3 years of bulling (13 or so)

Soon highschool started, I was so miserable that I felt that I was cursed to experience things I didn't want (it wasn't that bad but I was young jaja) so I started to wish the exact opposite of everything I wanted, but I was surprised to see that it didn't went that bad, I actually enjoyed highschool and finally made some friends 

And at end of high school (17) I had good friends by my side and I learnt to forgive my parents, I started to go to the gym and everything was good 

And as if life as if trying to complete what it was it's masterpiece...

I started to feel my hands trembling more than usual (I had this problem since I was 5), but unlike usual my head started to shake slightly and it started to be difficult for me to speak. As obvious as it may seem to you I didn't though about Parkinson because I always had this problem.

Almost 3 years have passed, I know now that I have a genetic Parkinson and my dying slowly enough for it to not be an urgent so I can freely do what i want and fast enough to know that my dreams are just that, dreams that will never come true 

Now I don't know what to do. 
I rather kmf than growing so helpless that I need a caretaker 
And I rather kmf than losing my memories due to demencia (there is a high chance to have it with Parkinson) 
And I rather kmf than keeping my memories inside helpless body 

The problem is that I don't want, I would like to see my siblings growing up, I want to have a child to give all the love I couldn't have but I simply can't

Is there any downside for seeking a diagnosis for Borderline Personality Disorder?,1,1.0,1717033902.0,"(I'm not asking for medical advice. I'm just asking about the pros or cons of getting medical advice from a physical doctor.)



Hello. I'm just wondering if somebody could help me figure out: **Is there is a drawback or downside to being diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder?**

(I do not currently have a medical diagnosis for BPD. Only depression and anxiety.)

A family member warned me that I should not discuss my anger issues with the doctor. She was worried it could prevent me from being allowed on flights. Or if there is ever a lawsuit, the other person's lawyer could request medical records and use what I talked to the doctor against me.

IDK if these are valid concerns, or irrational.

Regardless, I feel it makes better sense to get a diagnosis so that I know if I do / do not have BPD, or something else. That way I can plan with the doctor, either medication adjustments or if different treatment is needed.

I guess I feel that: **Is it better to seek a diagnosis to deal with current issues, instead of worrying it may or may not cause a problem later?**

Worst birthday ever,1,1.0,1717028582.0,"Today was my 17th birthday. As it was approaching midnight of my birthday I started feeling depressed. So I drank half a bottle of straight 40% gin.

My parents called 111 and I was begging for medical attention because my chest hurt (I have a heart condition). No one took me to the hospital but this morning (my birthday) my parents were so pissed off and shouting at me. My dad gave me the silent treatment for basically all day and my mum and my dad when they would actually speak to me would just make snarky comments to me. I had to talk to the doctors who referred me back to camhs (camhs dropped me because I wasn’t bad enough) then camhs called and said that tomorrow I can have a psych evaluation from the crisis team. 

I know what I did wasn’t great but I was trying to stop myself from killing myself and from my trauma by getting wasted. 

All day my anxiety has been through the roof. Surprisingly I’ve not had a hangover the anxiety is from all of the screaming and embarrassment.

Psychology isn't a fully evolved field, it is still developing rapidly compared to other fields of medicine so maybe thats why but if i felt down, if i wanted to figure out whats going on etc. i should be able to book a therapist right now and in 3 hours be in a shrink's room.

But i can't, i can't do that. I can't just do that.

I'm not suicidal nor is it really an emergency but i am quite lazy, to have to wait so many months to get uncertain treatment is frustrating and discouraging, and to those who are suicidal a 10 minute call isn't enough support.

cheapest therapists/psychologists you can find are 30-60 an hour, usually they cost you about 80 an hour, if youre unlucky enough to not go through bullshit insurance planning.

even in countries with free healthcare the therapists they use are usually kind of hard to get, poorly trained and with few sessions.

Relationship ended due to my CPTSD causing flare ups in my partner's OCD,1,1.0,1717024032.0,"I'm really sad that my relationship ended. I was dating someone I really loved and adored. He was sweet, fun, funny. We made amazing memories together.

We started having conflict and triggering each other. It was really difficult to resolve. We couldn't hear each other.

After months of loving each other but also struggling to be heard by one another, our mental health flared up.

My CPTSD got very bad and I started having emotional flashbacks, stopped taking care of myself, started feeling helpless and alone.

He grew irritated with me, frustrated that I wasn't helping myself, and he started having OCD flareups that scared him – visions of harming his family or me (his loved ones) and a deep fear that he might lose control someday and do something. That's why he was avoiding conflict with me so desperately.

I am confident this is OCD because he is the most peaceful human though he has issues with control and a lot of fear around his own emotions. 

So he decided to break up with me, saying it was a great relief to get away from our dynamic, and that he was going to focus on his own healing.

This caused another CPTSD meltdown where I kept trying to get him to comfort me when he ended the relationship. He was supportive but understandably overwhelmed and just wanted space to be alone. I feel like I embarrassed myself.

I don't know how to feel right now because it feels weird to want to stay with someone who broke up with me because he was afraid he might hurt me in some way? Is this reasonable of me to want to stick with him through his emotional difficulties?

Second, I feel like trash because I keep making this about me: like he couldn't handle my depression and judged me for it, though he says he didn't. I guess I feel shameful about how I showed up in the relationship with so many wounds and so much more healing to do.

I am still looking for hope that we can rekindle something once we are both healed, because aside from our wounds, the relationship was magical.

Something i need to get off my chest ,1,1.0,1717023828.0,"I was switched from Clonazepam to diazepam to taper down and eventually go off the medication. My life has been going worse and worse since doing that, every dose reduction was hell, every symptom, you name it. I eventually came off of it a month or so ago.
Since starting the taper I experienced more and more anxiety plus all the withdrawal symptoms.
Since my last dose (April 30th) I started feeling more and more anxious as days went by…. until May 23th I had my first panic attack in months… I took 5mg Diazepam, I couldn’t take it no more. Since that day I have been taking it everyday and I have still been experiencing lots of anxiety and a panic attack here and there. I hope i will eventually stabilize again and stop having the panic attacks and this shit anxiety I’m feeling.
I have already made up my mind. After stabilizing I’m planning on going back to Clonazepam.
Anxiety and panic was the reason I started taking benzos back in 2019 after my dad passed away.
I don’t see the point in going off the meds if I’m gonna go back to my initial condition of extreme panic and anxiety. I understand that people that take benzos let’s say for sleep or muscle spasms or even recreationally and stopping them is not gonna hurt me so much on a daily basis, but for people with extreme anxiety and especially panic attacks like me there is no point in going through a hell of a taper and withdrawal symptoms just to go back to feeling the same or even worse than you felt before starting taking these meds.
At the end of the day we can’t forget the main reason we ever started taking them. If it’s gone, good. But if it comes back there is no point in suffering just because one day I might develop some tolerance and need to up my dose or develop some type of dementia when I get older.

I hate having BPD,1,1.0,1717018836.0,"It’s so hard to be vulnerable.

A couple years ago, my BPD began to manifest. Before, I was an abuse survivor who came out of foster care on top. Despite being abused throughout my childhood and adolescence, being in foster care, attempting to take my life multiple times, being in psychiatric units, navigating homelessness, etc etc - I graduated university and transitioned into a great career. Before the pandemic, I was so proud of myself for achieving so much in early adulthood.

I’m in my late 20s now and would say my mental health got bad in late 2020/early 2021. I felt so lonely. I felt mistreated by my partner. I resented not having a close connection to my family. I was angry for living in low income housing. So many things started to upset me. My adversity began to really sink in. I was tired of highlighting how horrible my life was to move forward and I felt like no one understood. I work in advocacy so it’s hard always having to revisit my trauma. I should probably do something else but I literally have no idea what else I’d do with my experience and education.

I chose explicit content to cope. It got to the point where I wasn’t living into my values and, to this day, I feel ashamed and embarrassed. It got to the point where I was suicidal and had to go into a psychiatric unit again, which is when I was formally diagnosed with BPD. That was in November.

This has hurt my partner a lot. I was unfaithful. I’m going to therapy but I still struggle with my urges from time to time and give into looking at explicit content. Objectively, it’s probably at a healthy level for someone without BPD. But I feel like it’s getting worse again, even though I’m making progress in therapy. DBT is great and all but I can drop the anchor and go on walks so many times before it becomes “whatever.” 

I confessed to my partner how I’m still struggling. She’s hurt and angry that I wasn’t honest with her when she’d ask if “I’m doing anything bad.” I told her I didn’t want to argue. She honestly has a hard time dealing with my struggle. I told her I started taking cymbalta and she was like “are you really depressed? I thought you were just addicted to porn.” And then went on to say how she should focus more on her feelings and that people don’t take what she’s going through seriously. When I express how I feel, no matter what it is, it goes back to her. and I can empathize. I know this is a lot for her to deal with and it’s not fair.

Constant and uncontrollable thoughts. ,1,1.0,1717018594.0,"So, years and years ago I had something happen that I would consider a “break” from reality. It was so bad I had to move into my parents house and I just sat there and didn’t do a single thing for months. Thought of suicide. Etc. Then I went into a delusional phase where I quit a business me and my cousin made because I suddenly wanted to become a politician to change the world. Then went on to research and change my mind over and over. Until I went right back to suicidal thoughts. After about a year of flipping back and forth between being delusionally inspired and contemplating suicide, I went back to “normal”. I’ve been feeling a lot better lately but I’ve started to get interested in what truly happened to me. It went completely undiagnosed. So I thought I’d share my thoughts here and get opinions on some things to help me narrow down what I should bring up to a psychiatrist. There’s something that runs in my family that’s undiagnosed because they’re too against mental health stuff. And bipolar has recently come to my attention. I always thought I had adhd because my brain works in a really wierd way. But apparently it may be common with bipolar as well. My inner monologue is…broken. I haven’t had the ability to truly think things through since I could remember. I kind of just let my subconscious mind do and decide everything. I don’t even know what I’m gunna say/type until it’s already done. If I forcibly try to think with my inner monologue, it just gets a few words in and starts repeating itself. Meanwhile, I start to get bombarded with other things. Like rapidly flashing pictures, random noises/words/phrases, and even sometimes multiple of my inner monologue talking at once saying random stuff. It’s so useless that I’ve just stopped trying to use it. And that’s how I’ve been living for more than a decade. If I just live on subconscious mode, I don’t even notice all that stuff. It’s a lot easier. I’m starting to worry that I may have something wrong with me that will come back in full force and send me down that path again. I don’t want to ruin my life or relationship.

Dealing with jobs/work ,0,0.5,1717017284.0,"I'm curious about how people balance work with their mental health. I'm currently a PhD student, and I will hopefully be graduating in a year, but the prospect of graduation terrifies me. I've had a lot of ups and downs in my mental health since being in grad school (including being diagnosed bipolar) and thankfully have decent flexibility with school so taking time off here and there hasn't been the worst, although I've probably been taking more than I should. I'll wake up in the morning and just be completely unable to face the day whether due to anxiety or depression or anything in between and decide to take it off or feel intensely like I have to take it off so I feel okay. But then I usually feel worse instead of better, because I feel lazy and like I'll never be able to hold down a real job if this is how I am and going to be. I'm already terrified of the future because its so up in the air, but feeling like I'm a failure and won't be able to be a real adult with a real job has really been weighing on my mind. I want to think its because I have not enjoyed my grad school experience and I've been having hardcore burnout since I've started, but I'm worried this is something I'll deal with for the rest of my life. I'm doing a lot of work on my mental health currently, but this is still a huge hurdle for me. I'll definitely have long stretches where things are good and this isn't an issue at all, but then I'll have a month where I take at least a day off each week, or work only two or three days for a few weeks.

Does my friend need support? ,1,1.0,1717016653.0,"Hello everyone,

This is a throw away account due to my main account being connected to the friend I'm worried about and I would like advice before I address my concerns. 

A little history, 2023 was a rough period for my friend, it was the first time in a while that they started self-harming (they have a history of this) and it seemed to happening more frequently, every time we meet up as a friend group they would do it at the place or after meeting up. Alongside this there were heavily drinking during the weekend too. 

2024 has happened and they have realise that they need help and have taken steps to overcome this. They no longer drink as much and they've stuck to minimum drink limit on nights out. They have also limited the amount social time with the friend group trying to work on themselves. They have also not self-harmed in seven months which I am very proud off and something we have celebrated together.

However one of there ways of coping is by writing down what they call 'depression rambles' and on a rcecent night they sent some to me, should I be worried? 

Here are the 'rambles' :- 
""There are days we're your drowning, the waves are crashing over your head and the only thing you can focus on is breathing, staying alive no matter what the cost. 

Then there are days where the water is still, when it's easier to breath, to make plans, to think positive…but you are always aware of that drowning feeling so it stops you. Is is easier to give in? Because the bad days are only around the corner? Because they will rear themselves once more.

In the end life is a circle and no matter how many ways you view that circle, it's still a circle…an endless repetitive cycle of the same…no matter how hard you try to manipulate it. It will always be the same.

It's strange how you can change after a period of darkness. It warps you, pulls you apart and smashes you into pieces. But there is a light, which helps to slowly repair yourself…but you're not the same anymore, that darkness has forever changed you and trying to fit yourself back into that mold you once was just doesn't work anymore. So what gives? Those bonds you made before the darkness? Or do you try to make new ones? Or do you sink back into that space of darkness, where it's familiar? I guess only time can give you those answers.

Another year and another birthday has passed. People tell you happy birthday yet it doesn't make sense, it's just another day. Millions of people share the same day, you are nothing special, so why do people feel the need to share the celebration with you? I wish I had the answer. I just want people to continue on with their normal day…there is nothing special about me. 

It's been 5 months since I've had more than a few drinks, the alcohol has loosen my lips and freed my negative thoughts from the chains that held it back. I enjoy drinking however is this a hindrance and I'm feeding the devil inside myself? Will I drown in these feelings yet again? This time I'm a little bit more knowledgeable than before but does that stop me repeating the same mistakes in the past? I guess time would tell. I wish she would share her secrets with me, it would make life so much easier.""

I'm sorry for the long post, I just want to help support my friend through this time

Basically, I just wanna know if what I feel is normal. I keep convincing myself bad things are going to happen to me/are happening to me.

Most recently, an old friend I haven't talked to in years reached out and asked if I wanted to meet up. I agreed, but then immediately after I convinced myself she's gonna bring people who don't like me and jump me or something, and now I'm terrified to go. I can't eat or sleep alone in open spaces without constantly looking around me even though logically I know I'm perfectly safe and nothing will happen. I don't really have any enemies, there's just like 2 people there was some drama with at school a few years ago, with a bunch of misunderstandings, and someone else pressuring me to say something I didn't wanna say, and now those two (justifiably) hate me. But apart from that I have no reason to be so paranoid of everything around me. Whenever I hear noises and I'm home alone I immediately convince myself someone has broken in and is in the house.

It seems like I keep convincing myself the worst outcome has happened, and then I can't let it go even if logically it's completely ridiculous 

I know all these things are quite small, and I don't actually think I'm mentally ill in any way, but I just wanted to know if this is normal. I'm probably just doing the same thing about all this, blowing it way out of proportion in my head lol

20M. For almost my whole life it’s been a running joke in my family and amongst friends that I don’t have a stress hormone. For the most part this is true, I’ve always preferred to take things as they come and live day by day. Until about a month ago. I really don’t know what the catalyst was, but I just became overly aware of the fact that everything around me is absolutely real, and in turn became conscious of my own mortality.

I can't really count how many meltdowns I had and how many times my dad lost control and screamed/assaulted me. There were two times where the police got called.

I’m 2 years away to be 30. Honestly I’m freaking out. I feel like I haven’t achieved anything in life. I am constantly anxious and depressed most of the time. My whole family is dead. Mum died of SLE , Dad died of a broken heart and my brother died of Malaria when he was 4. I was all I have left . I’ve moved to UK 6 years ago. I used to have a lot of friends and families back in my home country.Life was very much different back then. I was really popular at schools and workplace but that’s all end when I moved to a different country. Suddenly I’m all alone. I do have a husband but he has his own life (he’s local so) and usually very busy, don’t even answer my messages sometimes. So here I am posting on Reddit because I have absolutely no one to talk to which is really sad. 
           I kept in touch with a few of my friends from my home country but due to the differences in life they fall apart one by one now I only have two left to talk to. They have a very struggling life. They have to support their whole family with only their incomes so they have a lot on their shoulders. I turned out to be the one who always listened to their problems and be there for them but when I need someone to talk to they sometimes ignored me. They don’t take me seriously because from their POV : I have a comfortable life , don’t have to worry about money , living my best life etc. My problems are jokes compared to their.

The thing is I’m so fucking lonely and I’m sick of being lonely all the time. It’s really hard to make friends as you grow up or at least the friends that stick around. I don’t like making friends I like friends who met by accident like how school friends or colleagues turn to friends that sort of thing.

My mother lied by omission and now my life is worse.,1,1.0,1717012336.0,"I was in a 14 year relationship with someone I shouldn't have been in a relationship with. Nothing I did was right, which I never heard the end of. And when I did, it was never mentioned. I essentially lived every day to be tolerated. I would be told he never wanted to marry me, having a family with me, that I was a net-negative on his life. I am not without my own responsibilities in the failure of the relationship, mainly financial and ability to maintain employment. I would mentally breakdown and stop eating or going to work - which made things worse. It was an unhealthy cycle. We loved each other, but we were not good for one another. However, I never spoke to him the way he did me.

Which was why I took my mother's assistance when I was ready to leave. He and I both needed to me to leave. He didn't want me to. I didn't want to. But it was necessary.

My mother and I have a colored relationship. It was better than it had ever been when I was looking to leave my relationship. She told me they had an extra room ready for me at her home and it was ready for me. I used the last of my funds and moved myself back to an area 3 states away that I never wanted to come back to but did as I thought there would be a safe place for me.

I get here. The room isn't ready. The room is full of  old cat feces, insects, mice, and cigarette tar. The home belongs to her boyfriend whom she moved in with several years ago. The room was his old bedroom that he hadn't touched since the passing of his wife 10 years ago.  The house had apparently been like that when my mom moved in and she had cleaned up A LOT of the house with used to be like that in every room.

How is it since you started a treatment for depression/anxiety/stress ?,1,1.0,1717011214.0,"Hello everyone,

I hope this topic isn't too redundant or that the question hasn't already been asked too many times. If it is, I'll delete this post.

I'm coming to you to ask how things have been for you since you started your treatment for depression, anxiety, stress, etc... because during my last session with my psychologist she advised me to go and see a specialist in order to perhaps start treatment.

To give you some context, I started seeing a psychologist at the beginning of March, with whom I discussed my situation. I'm a 25m who has never really worked in his life (only 3 weeks if you add it all up), who failed his studies, who still lives at home with his parents, who doesn't have a driving license and who has a bad relationship with his parents.  Because of this, my therapist suspect a generalized anxiety disorder and maybe dysthymia (these are not diagnostics, just some hypothesis). Since starting therapy, I'm much more aware of the problems I'm facing, which in a way makes things worse emotionally because I have a clearer view of the issues I need to address in my life.

At the end of our last session, she advised me to go and see a doctor who could, if he saw fit, prescribe a suitable treatment to help me in addition to the therapy sessions. Since then, I've done some research on the different options that are available to me, but I'm a bit afraid of depending on medication to feel well for the rest of my life (or of its impact on my life and health), so I was wondering if you had any advice or experiences to share with me (good or bad) ?",mentalhealth,SimplyMeanGuy,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d3kppp/how_is_it_since_you_started_a_treatment_for/,0

At around 16 I was diagnosed with multiple severe mental illnesses. The most debilitating issues I deal with are unipolar depression and severe disassociation.

Until a few years ago, I couldn’t go more than three or four months without having a full mental breakdown and ending up in inpatient treatment. I am very lucky I survived so long, and that I have been able to get myself to a place of moderate stability. Well, stable enough for me. 

But yeah, I’ve never met anyone who comes even close to the amount of times I’ve been committed. I’ve met some people who have gone maybe 20 or 25 times. But 80??

It was fine at first but gradually having that kind of stress on your scalp for hours everyday gets unbearable painful, I'd be tearing up all day and had very painful headaches.

Job and Life Insecurity,0,0.5,1717003191.0,"I have been working full time for over 6 years at the same company which is also my first full time employment.

I've been unhappy at my current role and the company for a while now due to stress, politics and toxic and manipulative environment. Some of the reasons I stayed through:

1. Not knowing what I want to do in life : still haven't found it. But somehow having a job which is stressful and chaotic kept me busy so I don't have to think about this and get back into existential crisis.
2. Changes in the roles, leadership as well as relocations which often sparked curiosity and hope; however now I realize not much change after all and not all changes were for the good.
3. Fear of the uncertainty and fear of being unemployed : social pressure
4. Having the comfort of knowing the people at the company and having some friends.
5. Not getting paid good but also not bad as in it is enough for me to live comfortably and also save some money. And I somehow have a fear of living off my savings without any income flow.
6. Maybe laziness as if I quit my job, I'll also need to go back to my home country which is fine but the idea of moving still sounds intimidating and I'd much rather go back home with a better opportunity.

Lately, things became unbearable due to new management and the changes of the job scope which kept on adding more and more responsibilities and stress. New management is quite bad as well with no empathy or leadership skills who would rather mob and gaslight than support.

And I've also managed to save a decent amount of money which can allow me to live fine for a few years without any income.

However, I find it very hard to find the courage in me to quit. I guess much of it is due to feeling insecure about the future without having this or a job.

I don't trust myself or the market enough to find a new job as soon as I quit and I am quite afraid of being unemployed because I still remember how anxious I was after graduation before I got this job after a couple of months of applying. I do apply to jobs now but get rejected. I think I can get a job still with my skills and experience but I also wouldn't want to get a worse job doing the same thing for a smaller company for less money and no guarantee it won't be more toxic than the current one.

And I'm not sure how much this would weigh but although I dislike my job and activities I  somewhat feel responsible for the work I'm doing and I don't want to leave people under the rubble after I quit. I would also like to leave on good terms and performance so it won't hinder my future ventures.

To early to ask for antidepressants?,1,1.0,1717002217.0,"For some context I believe I have been depressed for 2-3 years now, but got ""used to it"" so to say. But recently because of some  important realizations I made about my life it feels like things have finally overflown.

My depression up until now has been mostly a lack of joy in life.  I find I have no motivation and no energy in general. I can feel a short busy of happiness when I for example see a funny video but, I lack any sort of long term joy and enjoyment in life. I am also probably passively s**cidal (I dont want to k*ll myself, but have thought it would be nice to just sleep and not wake up). 

But now that things have overflown and I am not used to my depression anymore. It feel it's getting harder and harder to keep up a ""normal"" lifestyle and I feel myself getting drowned in my own negative thoughts.

I have seen a therapist 2 times before, but not necessarily for depression. Now yesterday just had my first visit at a therapist for this issue. 

Now for my question: I have considered asking my therapist about antidepressants. I know antidepressants won't cure the underlying problems for my depression but I kinda hope it might just make it a bit easier for me to live my life and not be devoured by my own thoughts.

I dislike being attracted to women,2,0.63,1717001493.0,"I'm 18 years old and a virgin.

I feel like it's an inconvenience for me to be attracted to women. I see women as women, not quite as people, and it drives me mad. I also feel... shame? Or disgust? Something along those lines but to a small degree.

When I talk to a woman, I talk differently. When I walk with a woman, I walk differently. When I'm anything with a woman that I'm attracted to, I'm just different. Like I'm trying to see if our relationship can deepen so we're bf and gf, and so I can access their pants. Subconsciously. And even if I acknowledge me acting differently consciously in the moment, its not like I can stop. 

Whoever is with me is still an attractive woman. I don't even want it to lead anywhere. I don't have what it takes right now for a girlfriend. And although I'm against being attracted to a woman for the most part, it's not like I don't want love. A relationship with someone I truly care about romantically would be the best. And expressing that love in bedy bed is great as well I'm sure. But I want an off switch for my sex drive.

Even if I.... satisfy myself, the itch is still there. And unlike normal itches, it only grows stronger the longer I leave it. And the clarity afterwards doesn't help nothing. Okay, so what if I sleep with someone? I already know that won't help anything, and I also know it won't be as ""magical"" as I think it will be. The way that stuff is depicted in.... VIDEOS isn't realistic. 

I don't WANT to talk differently when I'm with someone beautiful who just so happens to be female, I just want to talk. I'm no damn white knight, I just want a real tried and true solution to this. Please, just give me anything. (Sorry for a mess of a post.)

I have an anxiety disorder and cptsd that makes me experience flight or fight to an extreme degree. I always feel fidgety or nervous and experience mood swings when unmedicated. I go to therapy, I help other people, I get help from my own people. I am still mentally ill and likely always will be because my anxiety disorder was caused by a physical condition(thyroid cancer). What I’m saying is I do everything right and I’m still a bit fucky.

Today I want to bring up something that I think can help a lot of people. Social media and instant gratification.

I have spent a lot of time looking for validation through social media. Making friends is hard, being vulnerable and feeling like you aren’t worthy of it because you believe that you are somehow damaged is hard. Just waking up in the morning alone can be so difficult. The thing I found though is that… that validation doesn’t last. The constant need to one up yourself and strive for perfection with a million eyes on you is a stressful thing. 

So recently I went out of town, I forgot my charger and I couldn’t use my phone for a week or two. It was fine. Yeah I missed calls but… honestly… fuck those people lmao. I feel better than I have in years right now. I haven’t thought about any of the crazy assed news outside of my control making me feel like the world is constantly changing beyond my sight. I don’t feel this overwhelming need to respond to be seen. I’ve found enjoying my own company and walking down the road to my job has been enough for me. 

I’m not saying this will fix everything, but some of you may benefit from turning your phones off and enjoying a good show or going on a walk. We started letting sunlight in the house more and everyone’s moods have improved. Apparently sitting in a room without any natural light is REALLY bad for you. (Seriously, look it up. 😩) 

What I’m saying is, sometimes the problem is our habits making us feel WORSE than we already would. Eating a healthier diet made me feel less like shit, which made me less tired, which added in with the no sun made me lethargic, which mixed with the panic and sass of social media was a cocktail of bullshit for my brain to pay the bills. I am no naturalist ok. I don’t think you can magic away your brain problems with crystals and good vibes.

"struggling with low self-worth, low self-respect, low confidence & the people I attract who treat me less-than",1,0.67,1716994093.0,"I know this is not a group of mental health professionals, but I am struggling to keep my head above water and thought maybe someone here found a solution for themselves.

For context below:  ""People/relationships"" = platonic friendships & romantic relationships & family relationships

I’ve hit rock bottom with my mental health again.  It's been over 10 years since I've felt this low and depressed.

I realized that I attract people who love-bomb me, try to change me, then remove me from their lives because they decide I’m not good enough for them (often because I won't change the way they want me to).  I attract people who treat me like this because I’m a people-pleaser, I have low self-worth, low self-respect, and low confidence.  I feel worthless, and the way people treat me reinforces that belief.

Intellectually and logically, I ***know*** I’m a quality human being and a catch who deserves better people, better treatment, and better relationships, but something is blocking me from **believing** these things and **living as if I believed them**, especially when I am continually treated like I am less-than because those are the types of people I attract.  Even though I know I deserve better, I believe that these ""better people"" are superior to me, and I have no chance with them.  Frankly, I am superior to the people that I attract.  (That last sentence requires a ton of context which I'm not going to type out, so just trust me on that one.  My therapist tells me ""you can definitely do better than \[person\]."")

I’m at the point where I have **ONE** friend (who, thankfully, does not fall into the above descriptions), this is my **ONLY** relationship, period.  I have very little hope for the future.

Have you had any major success with any **techniques or activities**, to raise your self-worth and self-respect and confidence?

I already do the typical/suggested things:  talk-therapy, intense exercise, yoga, meditation, eating healthy, self-care, no alcohol, etc.  I do not sleep well or much, but I haven't been able to control that even with consulting a sleep clinic.

“Go out and meet people/make friends” is not a solution, see above regarding the types I attract.  I know that I need to fix these problems within myself **BEFORE** I try to create new relationships, so that I start attracting higher quality people who will treat me the way I want to be treated (ie normally).  Plus, I'm **SO** depressed right now, I have nothing left to give to others and I'm not fun to be around.

Relationships with my relatives are complicated and they are either distant or unsupportive, so that is not a solution.

I’m not interested in joining a religion or taking Rx medication.

I already **know** “that I need to believe in myself and believe I have worth and believe I deserve respect”, etc.  But that is obviously not helping, therefore I’m looking for **ACTUAL** suggestions and not just flowery platitudes.

I (22 F) have a pretty decent life. I graduated recently and I am going for a PhD program. I had a troubled, troubled childhood. I have BPD, OCD, ADHD, and c-PTSD. I am on Concerta (54mg!), Waklert (150!!!), Zonalta, Arip, Admenta etc. and I take therapy too. 

I have these cycles of productiveness and unproductivity along with other cycles related to my disorders. I am right now going through a time where I CAN'T WORK AT ALL. My professor at the PhD program trusts me with the work and I feel like an AH that I can't stand up to his expectations right now.

I sleep, all day. Even when I am on Waklert and Concerta. I wake up and I still feel sleepy. I feel amotivated as fuck and really can't can't put myself to work. I try, I really do, but I can't make myself work or study.

I am not organized AT ALL. People around me tell me I am good at my work, but I feel I am an impostor. I have fooled everyone. And with this unproductive phase my head just screams this even louder.

I know certain things that can help me, exercise (I used to walk 15-20 kms a day before I came home from my university a month ago. My productivity has gotten really bad since then. Now I barely walk.). I know having a better schedule will help BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO START. I AM SCARED OF STARTING. IT IS THE TOUGHEST PART OF ANY TASK.

Can someone please, please help me. Suggest me anything, tell me anything that can work that worked for you or is something you firmly believe in. Is there any organisational app? How is effecto or daylio? Is there anything I can do to help myself? Shall I read Taking Charge of Adult ADHD?

I can't tell friends either as they're across the US (we moved 10 months ago).

Hard to understand myself ,1,1.0,1716985458.0,"So off late I've been going through some things emotionally and it's been rough. I honestly don't understand the feelings but I just wanted to get it out there in a completely objective environment. So here goes.

There are times where I struggle just to go through the motions of everyday life. To just get the strength to get up, be normal and do something with my day. I have days where I'm filled with positivity and am crazy productive. Then there are days where I go to the extreme opposite, where I feel living is futile, whatever I do can't possibly make a difference so who cares.

It is in those rock bottoms that I turn to temporary solutions, namely alcohol. It is in those times where I don't know, maybe something in my subconscious tells me to do it, and maybe I go through with it because my mind feels numb and I don't have to think. I feel too tired to think.

I am terrified on the impact it will have on those who are closest to me. I have an amazing partner. He truly goes out of his way to try and help me. I think maybe I'm scared to ask, to show him the helpless creature that is there deep inside?

I'm scared I'll hurt him. And honestly I don't want to be this way anymore.

I've started seeing a therapist to try and help me get to the bottom of this and start truly healing. But last week she had to cancel due to a personal emergency and I had a relapse with the whole alcohol thing. No, I do not crave it, I can go weeks, even months, without going anywhere near the stuff. It's in those low moments that I turn in that direction and I hate it.

I feel lonely and isolated most of the time. I moved to a new country about 2 years ago and it's been tough getting new friends. It's hard for me to make friends, to trust and open up to people.

Depression or just my personality? ,1,1.0,1716979941.0,"Hi! 

I have an ongoing struggle with depression for almost ten years where the biggest symptom is self hatred.

So that's why I'm looking into it now. Given my dysfunction right now to simply get out of bed, I feel like an improvement of any kind would vastly outweigh many of the known side effects. I'm currently unemployed, so if I were to do it, this is the best time to do so.

I feel very distant from a friend after opening up. why could this be?,2,1.0,1716959883.0,"as the title says. let me provide some background knowledge first.

I have been friends with this person with about a decade now. we're pretty good friends (I like to think, at least). about a week ago, me and this friend went into those deep conversations that spiral into personal stuff. now, I personally hate opening up. I hate doing it, and I haven't done it.

during that deep conversation with my friend, I was left with no choice, and so I did it (willingly), and they did the same. I obviously held back quite a lot and gave minimal information, but I noticed that after that I felt very detached and distant from them. I do consider them one of my 'closer' friends, but now I'm not so sure. it's even affecting normal stuff we'd usually do. now I don't feel like inviting them to play games, or to talk to them as much. it's as if I had some sort of visceral reaction. 

and it's not even that there was a power imbalance, or that they opened up more than I did or vice versa. it doesn't feel like there was anything inequal, but regardless of everything being seemingly normal, when I think of or look at that friend, I feel empty. distant. it's such an odd feeling. and I'm not even sad about it either.

Is ignorance a bliss? Pl read the post & advice,1,1.0,1716965337.0,"32M - Single - India - MBA - Working in a good city.

Recently there's a plethora of thoughts going in mind. After working in different profile in different countries I'm recently feeling I'm being overwhelmed due to the fact of too many things going in the world. If I see any thing happening around, my mind automatically goes to think about the things that could have lead to or what's happening underground. (For eg: If I see any new govt initiatives or govt spending on something - I try to think how that particular thing could have been done by the company that had taken the contract rather believing that the govt doing that for people's welfare).

If any one tells or asks me something I try to think too much on what their motive will be - what could run in their mind. I've started to believe that everything in this world at present is circulating around money! This is taking a toll on my 'process to find a partner via matrimony apps or services'. Me & my family have been looking around for a partner for me via these services (this is how it works in most of Indian families).

By God's grace I am doing well & I used to long for this position when I was young. But now I see there's a lot of talented hardworking people above me/ older than me, a lot of institutions, systems, law - I feel like I'm not doing enough. I know you'd try to advice me to look towards the people who is underneath me or practice gratitude.

The point I'm trying to make is: since I have varied experience in my career & I talk to a lot of people (due to my work).. I feel like there's too many people in this world trying to do something or carve out the major portions for themselves. My boss is a hardworking selfish guy who doesn't even mentor his team, just does whatever will put him forward. He's so concentrated in his work & life - he doesn't even check social media or any much entertainment. Is he able to be peaceful because he is not exposed to other fields or other things in life? Did I over expose myself (since I've worked in various profiles in different domains & functions) or Is this my ego which is saying that I know much where as the fact is I don't know much?

At present: my ego says that I know things many people don't but I tell myself that it is just my ego trying to glorify myself. It is started to affect my work in a hard way. Any new projects I do - I am not confident even if I do a good job - my ego says that I'm very good but I suppress that thought by saying that I am no special. My ego says you do something and be special at work - but I tell myself that you'd make a joke out of yourself.

What is it and is it serious? ,1,1.0,1716965249.0,"Recentely some of my weird behaviours and thoughts have been getting worse and I don't know if they are normal thus I'm overreacting or there is smt wrong with me and I should seek help.

1)When someone asks me to borrow something, especially my sister. Usually I either don't want to give away this thing bc ""it's mine"" or ""it belongs there and if you take it I'll have to worry all day about putting it back"", and if they don't give the thing back once they are done I get REALLY mad and sometimes even cry

2)I don't like unpacking my stuff from my suitcase bc then I will have to put it back on at the end of summer and if I leave there it's already ready and I don't have to fear I might lose something

3)Caring about how my things are positioned in my room and I HATE when somebody touches smt and I have to put it back in its place, mainly bc it has to be how I like it in my order and bc I'm scared I'll lose these things and maybe somebody (my sister) might take them and I won't realize.

4)When somebody wants to borrow something I might just gift it to them. Once my sister asked me if she could try my swimsuit on, and she ended up liking it so much she asked if she could borrow it and I just said she could have it. Then I went to the bathroom and cried for like a whole 20 mins and even started to cut through my skin with my nails almost to the point it bled. the only reasons I could find are that ""she deserves it more than me"", ""I wouldn't wear it either way bc it's too pretty for me and she's gorgeous so she'll definitely use it more"" and also that ""if I share it then at this point why have it"", I bought for me cause I never dress nicely bc I feel like who I am is just someone who doesn't care and maybe by buying and wearing this swimsuit I could escape this ""false/forced"" image I created and be free.

For the same reason I'm scared of dressing better: I literally wore the same 2 hoodies for the whole school year bc I had no courage to wear anything else and hear people comment (even if in a positive way).

5)Taking things as a form of self punishment and bc I don't deserve things. When I go out with my friends I don't buy anything or try to spend less as I can bc I feel too guilty spending my parent's money, also bc my sister spends a lot of it when she goes out and I fear my parents may not be able to afford another child who does this. Additionally when we're on a trip I always compare what my sister buys in total to what I bought and always hope I spent less money mainly bc if I spend less I know she can get what she wants bc after all ""she wants it"" and I should sacrifice some of my joy for hers. Like when we went to Malta once and my father took us to starbucks bc he knows I wanted to get smt there, however my sister also came and ordered something and I felt too guilty to take anything so I just said I wanted nothing.",mentalhealth,_Just_asking_stuff_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d35tcm/what_is_it_and_is_it_serious/,3

My significant other does drink occasionally, and is aware of my issues, but doesn't think they need to completely change to accommodate me, which I understand. We've generally come to an agreement that they will basically only drink around me once or twice every couple of months and that if they want it other times they will do so when I'm not around and I can basically deal with that. I haven't told other friends everything about my issues so when I'm around them, it becomes a major issue for me and I've started pulling away because I can't handle it and to them drinking is VERY important parts of their lives. Also, sometimes my SO forgets our understanding or decides that the couple drinks will be at the same time and causes issues for me. I guess my question is how should I discuss this with others? Do I give them the full story or is it not needed (SO knows the whole story already)? Should I realistically expect any changes or should I reduce contact?

I actually have two different questions but both are kinda similar

1.  In my head I can’t accept my age. I am 19. But whenever like a form or someone asks my age I have to think really hard about it because every time my brain immediately jumps to I’m still 17. I do feel as though I have had my childhood and most of my life striped from me. When I was kid my family became homeless and I had to watch my little brother and make sure we always had somewhere safe to go. Once it was all over I feel as though my parents were never the same again. Which I get but like not even similar to the parents I had. I feel as though these people are just strangers now. Skip ahead a few years I was raped. The police never did anything about it and my dad screamed at me for having sex. Then my friend who helped me through that all died from fentanyl. Skip ahead a couple more years and now I’m 18 having my daughter. I guess what I’m trying to ask is is that something normal? Do I need to seek help? 

2. Last month my little sister passed away. My beloved little sister. Her boyfriend had shot and killed her. I attended her funeral. I swear the entire time I kept seeing her move. I thought I had saw her breathing. A slight smile at one point. But anytime I think about it I just think she’s still in the hospital. Just taking her time recovering but she’s not. She’s gone.

How depression can affect a person ...,1,1.0,1716963482.0,"I don't think anyone will see this and I don't know what this is but I believe everyone has a story and here is a part of mine.

I grew up in a house with my older brother and my younger sister with my two parents. I was the middle child. Maybe things are different in other households but I felt constantly left out. My mom had my younger sister and my dad had my older brother, making me feel like I had nobody growing up. I never had too many friends either. I often felt pretty lonely at a young age. When I was around nine I started to deal with pretty shitty ""friends"" and that affected me a lot. This was around the time my depression started kicking in. Covid also occurred during this time leaving me to feel more alone than ever. I always told myself I would end up dead right before I could even turn 10 just because I was struggling so much. I used to pray to God begging him to take me and end my suffering.

I started self-harming at eleven. I don't know how I got the idea of it all I know is that I needed to release something to calm me down. My parents caught me, blamed it on my phone, and was grounded. Soon after that, I was put into therapy. Although I was grateful for the help, I felt hopeless and that I could not get this feeling out of me. I was diagnosed with depression at twelve and was put on Prozac. My mom found one of my suicide letters so that's how I ended up there. I don't even know how I made it out of 7th grade alive. I made at least 8 suicide plans. I was too scared to go through with some of them because even though I wanted to, there was always a voice in the back of my head telling me not to lose hope and that someday I would find happiness and love.

I've been living off that mindset for a little while but sometimes my depression gets over me. I wish I didn't have to live with this. I wish I knew how to be happier. I start high school next year and I think I'm too young to constantly be this sad. I have been on Prozac for nearly two years and it kills me knowing I have to take meds to feel ""okay.""

Sometimes it just hits like a wave over me and I can’t get out of it, I should be happy because I have a “good” life yet I struggle day to day. For a bit of context, 10 years ago I struggled with my mental health and wanted to unalive myself however I was stopped, I got better and worked on myself. Now I don’t have time to work on myself with 2 kids and any time I do have I’m working. 
Im exhausted and to be honest if it wasn’t for my kids I wouldn’t be here, they keep me going and keep me busy. I get annoyed really easily, my partner and I are constantly arguing. She says she understands but she doesn’t. Honestly I’m at a crossroads, I need advice before something happens.

Random thought keeps me from being happy ,1,1.0,1716957212.0,"I left high school a year early due to personal circumstances. I therefore had to work so hard to get into university. I initially attended an institution that awards degrees for people who can’t go to university (not sure what they’re called in the UK) and I did a foundation year and 2 years of my degree there. After that I managed to transfer to a normal university and I was so relieved because I so desperately wanted to get into university despite personal obstacles in my life. 

However since graduating, I often have this overwhelming feeling when looking at other people and how healthy they look, that I feel like I’m not a human anymore as if I’m some kind of sub-human because I didn’t go to a normal university for the most part. Does anyone know this feeling? The feeling of not being connected to healthy people anymore? It feels so sad to experience. I really wish I could feel like me again.

Horrible memory is affecting my life ,3,0.81,1716929289.0,"18 M, I’ve always had a poor short term memory but I feel that over the last couple of years it’s been declining more and more and it’s affecting my day to day life. 

For example, I can’t remember instructions correctly. If I’m told to do 3 sets of instructions I can only remember the last one given to me. This really hurt me at a uni interview I had where I was asked to solve a verbal maths problem and I felt like a complete idiot when all the instructions given to me got completely muddled in my head, so much so that I couldn’t complete it and I was sent a rejection letter… yet I knew the subject well and I should’ve been able to solve it. 

I feel like I can no longer learn, even when I write notes, really try to listen it doesn’t retain. It’s not that I can’t focus, it just feels like my brain filters all the information out. I make mistakes repeatedly because I forget about how I solved it the previous time. It doesn’t matter if it’s verbal, or if I read the information it just doesn’t go in. When I read books I can’t tell you what it was about, my brain reads the individual words but can’t form the sentence in my head. I don’t remember what people look like and it causes embarrassing situations where I’m introducing myself to people I already know, repeatedly. When I try to solve maths problems, I’ll start working it out and then forget my thought process but keep writing because I know what to do but I almost don’t know why I’m doing it. 

I was a high achieving child but over the past 5 years my memory has been making me feel like more and more of an idiot. I dropped out of college, I tried to get into uni… it was supposed to be my time to do something with my life but I messed that up to.

As a human, it makes me sick to my stomach to see other humans in this condition. Why can I not look away? Not in a car crash kind of way, but in a genuinely concerned and conscious sort of way. I went to school for politics and law, and I have a job in a very political field with a lot of emotion. I go to work and deal with the grief of others, and I open my phone to see the most graphic and raw display of carnage I've ever seen. This is the first genocide that most westerners have experienced first-hand - including myself - and it's brutal. To top it off, hearing people say with their chests that ""they deserve it"" and hearing people justify the visibly-substantiated genocide that is occurring makes me feel like I am crazy. What are they seeing other than the burning flesh and the devastating state of what used to be a vibrant city? The real question is, how far will people go to veil their brazen prejudice?

My brother is depressed,1,1.0,1716948994.0,"I'm asking for some advice/free knowledge:

My brother is suffering from depression. I have been dealing with it myself but lately, I've been doing better. He's young and I try to provide so much support and options so he knows he isn't alone, he can reach out if he needs to vent, even if he just needs to sit in silence for a bit together. 

Our dad is the reason we both have depression and has given a fair amount of trauma. My brother is also autistic and was never treated properly because of it. I've practically raised him myself and have tried to give the emotional support my parents couldn't.

Unfortunately, my brother has picked up bad habits from my dad. His latest thing is sarcastically wishing me well and a good time whenever I spend the night(s) away from the house (with friends or my bf) and dumping how his life is shitty and nothing matters, etc.

I know I'm not a professional and can't solve his problems instantly. I have highly suggested therapy bc I think it would be a solid start to help them fight thoughts I'm not professionally able to provide. Ive also given the suicidal hotline bc I don't think they want my help (like they view me as a parent more than a sibling or friend).

Admittedly worried and Idk if I should have a hospital nearby ready (idk how beneficial or not beneficial they are). 

I don't want him to try anything but he's actively pushing me away/being hurtful. I have in the past been manipulated by someone threatening suicide and my dad actively guilt trips. I feel horrible at the thought self preservation and leaving it alone altogether.

I don’t think I’m taking too many, I take Escitalopram (for depression and anxiety, switching to bupropion soon), Aripiprazole, (for intrusive thoughts), and Dextroamphetamine (I take an ER and IR pill). I also take Lorazepam as needed (1-2x a week).

Every time I go to reach for my meds my parents look at me disappointingly, like I’m doing something bad. They tell me my meds are addictive, hard to come off of, and there are too make side effects.

Can't stop picking at my tooth and jaw cracking for years,2,1.0,1716927641.0,"I've been picking at my top incisor tooth and cracking my jaw for about 2 years now and I cannot stop doing them. This is affecting and taking control my life.

What I'm currently suffering from:

1. Jaw cracking
I have TMJ on my left jaw which allows me to position and set it up for a satisfying ""crack"", and I can do this every 10-20 seconds interval. Cracking the jaw is so darn satisfying and I can't stop doing it every single day. It doesn't hurt. As a result, I think this could be shifting my teeth structure for the worse. 

2. Teeth picking, biting lip and tongue playing 
My incisor tooth was perfectly straight and aligned with the neighbouring teeth. I am intentionally making it shift, pushing it with my thumb, and then checking how far it has shifted by biting onto my thumb and checking its bite mark. 

I would take photos of it from time to time to see the shifting progress, check in the mirror every day to see how far it has shifted and how thin it's gotten, and playing with it with my tongue. My tooth has gotten thinner and sharper as a result. To make things worse, I'd bite to cut my lower lip since it has gotten sharper and it can do damage. 

Consequences:
- Tooth enamel is getting thinner and sharper
- Tooth is shifting rapidly as a result
- This has taken over a big part of my daily life. Affecting my mental health. I am constantly thinking about my tooth and checking how bad it has gotten every time I see a mirror. 

The worse my tooth and condition becomes, the ""better"" and ""more satisfying"" I feel. 
I have this unexplained inner feelings of wanting to make myself worse. Is this somewhat associated with a kind of ""self-destructive"" tendency and thought?  

To add, I do it most often when I'm thinking about things, it helps with my thoughts. I do it sometimes without even realising. Doing all these gives me a very satisfying feeling, which I believe is one of the reasons why I cannot stop doing them. I stop temporarily only when my lip bleed and hurts. 

I absolutely hate this about myself and I want to stop immediately. I'm unfamiliar with these behaviours and I don't know what is going on. I'm trying really hard to fight it and I hope I can get the advice and help I need here.

Is this a mental disorder? Possibly associated with anxiety or OCD?

Updates on my ED:
I noticed I feel genuinely tired most times, and I keep on passing out at school and at home, and my weight drastically changed overtime. I was about 60kg+ a few years back and now I weigh just above 41kg, I am on the verge of being underweight. 

I looked at old pictures of myself a few years ago and I looked so much different back then, my face was a lot bigger, my arms were bigger, my stomach was bigger and my legs were bigger. 

Everytime I look at these photos of myself I feel so proud, but I also feel horrible because I lost all this weight in a horrible way. 

Basically, I would attempt to eat nothing or a LITTLE bit of food throughout my whole school day, but when I get home and my mum makes me food, I would eat it and then vomit it all out. 

If I have no school, I would never eat breakfast, and if I got really hungry I would eat a bit but vomit it out. I would basically vomit out every meal I ate.

One time, I was out with 2 twin girls and my then boyfriend at the time, we went to McDonald's and ate food. But I then excused myself to the bathroom and vomited everything out, then returned as if nothing happened.

I vomit out every meal I ate, my brain tells me too. I genuinely feel so awful doing it. It's been 4 years.

I am currently in CAMHS, (CAMHS is a UK based mental health services for teenagers, but I think some adults go there too, not sure.)

I am on the verge of being admitted to the Eating Disorders team on CAMHS, my therapist checked my weight like 2 months ago and I was 44kg, and now I am just above 41kg, she said if my weight dropped down more she would admit me in the Eating Disorders team.

Hi, so I have severe depression and anxiety, but in general aside from a few brief really bad times, I do not experience suicidal thoughts or feelings. My fiance is actively suicidal and always has been essentially. Lately we've been having a lot of fights because they get into a spiral and I can tell something's off and ask if I did something wrong. This upsets them and they say the proper response is to focus on their needs not make them feel the need to reassure me, and that while they understand that isn't my intention, its still detrimental to them because they need to be babied. I argued I'm not expecting any of that and it feels unfair to put things on me just because they feel they need to. I feel like I messed up by trying to push my perspective instead of letting them just leave and isolate which is the only way they will stop spiraling. it hurts knowing I have to just sit with my hurt and struggle, but they really blew up at me and told me to please just go away. They always say  they need me to tell them how I feel right away but this happens. I just don't really know what to do here. Is what they're expecting of me reasonable for someone in their position?

I thought I made the right choice, I still think so in fact But after two weeks it became a roller coaster in my head One day I feel like king of the world One day I don't get out of bed and hate myself But recently the problem is that I no longer feed myself I don't even feel hungry anymore, I couldn't tell you when my last meal was, but to be honest I don't even know how I'm still up. Eating was one of my greatest pleasures which I associate with the love shared a meal for me it is one of the best feelings. But when I am abandoned and everything falls into ruin there are things that I can no longer do, see, or hear In this relationship we had a very strong connection around meals, it was sacred. As a result I can no longer eat The only thing that goes into my stomach is a can of beer or monster every now and then, and sometimes I drink a little water in the shower. I'm broken and I don't know what to do

I don't like this person anymore but their problems have somehow traumatized me Abuse during childhood, incest, mother loss, grooming, drug abuse Now that the feeling and the person are gone I feel like I'm traumatized by everything I heard everything that happened to her through transfer

Has this ever happened to anyone?

I just sit in my room all day, and being sad and depressed, I just been sad since my friend left because she was a HUGE part of my life and she done so much for me. Some days I don’t wanna be here anymore because of what’s been going on at home, I can’t get away from it I can only get away from it when I go on my walks and that’s only 10-15 minutes because it’s too hot.

Most days I rarely ever eat because I just don’t want to eat anything, not that I’m trying to starve myself but that I just don’t want food. Like I absolutely love food but when I’m depressed I can’t eat, I feel bad for admitting that because I sound crazy. Being at home makes me feel depressed, being around my dad makes me depressed. But when I’m around my grandparents, aunt and uncle, cousins, and step mom I am NOT depressed. Knowing that my grandparents love me me more than my own parents, Bella loved me more than my parents do and that shows something. She always reminded me every day on how I am wanted, that I’m loved, that I’m appreciated, and so much more. It made me happy that she did that, because she truly cared for me but I blew it because I’m stupid. Some days it hard to roll out of bed because I’m so depressed, going to treatment won’t help because I’m over the age of 18 and I’ll be with the adults who are violent and I’m not violent. I just need a loving home to be in, because I would be happy living with a new family who will love me and appreciate me.

Is there any way to get someone out of a psychosis quicker?,0,0.5,1716935325.0,"I need some urgent advice about my friend, let's call him Peter, who is currently experiencing a psychotic episode.

Last year, Peter went through something similar, which ended with his family forcibly committing him to a mental hospital for a few weeks. It was a nightmare, but he eventually recovered and was back to his usual self. 

Fast forward to now, a year later, and it's happening again.

Peter's symptoms are frighteningly familiar: he's losing track of space and time, inviting mutual friends we haven't seen in years, as if he believes the present moment is 2017 or something.  


He sees things that are not there, and wanders around town annoying people with gibberish about the world ending. It's like he's stuck in a different era, unable to recognize the present moment. 

Seeing him like this again is devastating, and honestly, I don't feel up to going through the same ordeal.   
  
Part of me just wants to phone him & scream at him to snap out of it, that this nonsense should be done.   
  
The standard advice is to ""be there for him,"" but that only seemed to confirm his delusions last time, which didn't help at all.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation or have any advice on what to do? I want to help Peter, but I also need to protect my own mental health.

My entire childhood expectations have been placed on me rather than my sibling due to me being the oldest of an immigrant household. I carried the responsibility of keeping up grades, taking care of my sister, taking care of my alcoholic father, and helping my mentally struggling mother. On top of all this, I experienced many years of abuse from both parents and no support whatsoever. I have never learned how to make mistakes because I do not have the usual parents a child can fall back on for help I have to know everything about everything and mistakes are not an option because I will be alone to pick up the damage

Because of this my childhood has felt stripped from me, I fought to survive to the big 18 yr old milestone but part of of regrets fighting so much for it if where I am now was the outcome. Currently I'm figuring out college I am doing everything on my own from making orientation dates to paying for them to setting up advising sessions to figuring out transport due to me having to commute. Everything is on me with no parent involvement besides financial support and transportation. 

Because of this I have felt depressed, anxious, and suicidal. Now I cannot even look at anything college-related without becoming sick to my stomach. I feel constant anxiety and shame and I have no energy to give

I have tried to express to my family, that I need help because I feel like I am slowly drowning but that doesn't matter to them.

I'm tired, I'm exhausted, I have given everything to them and to everyone else and now I am left feeling like an empty shell of a human being. I can't find a reason to go on in this path

I have given my entire life and for transportation to get in the way of my lifetime goal of college breaks me. I have sacrificed everything and none of it matters

I don't want that to happen ever again and I'm trying to cope, and he is being more diligent about deleting old posts or reminders of past relationships, but I want to not feel these things at all, as I don't think they are rational.

Also, I still distrust him because he lied once when we were getting to know each other about a female friend he said was just a friend but later on confessed they had a romantic encounter when they were dunk once and almost had sex, and said he regretted the whole ordeal but left a really bad taste in my mouth he lied about it at first. He said he lied because he freaked out when I asked the question and thought it would turn into an argument and then it was too late to take it back.

I called EMS and got her help - she’s in the hospital now and stable. This all just happened.

I check in with her often, as I love her so much and don’t want to harm her, but she maintains this answer. 
I don’t even know if this is the right place. I’m in shock, and feel so guilty. I know she has other stressors - unexpectedly lost her job and is unemployed, estranged from her siblings, health issues etc, I can’t help but feel this is on me. And how do we move forward? I feel angry that had I not come to check on her, she would have gone to sleep and died in our home and I would have found her. I’m so relieved she’s okay but I’m so hurt too.

On paper everything seems fine. But I’m not happy. 

All my life I’ve struggled with self esteem and confidence, but I never let it get to me until I was around 15-16.

I suffered a psychosis and wanna tell my story.,9,1.0,1716891182.0,"Last summer (2023), I hosted a 4th of July party at my apartment and invited all of my friends. I was recently getting into smoking weed in an attempt to self medicate for my ADHD and mental health problems. One of my friends (we’ll call him John) that I invited over has been a stoner since high school so I trusted him on advice about weed. I had only smoked a few times prior to this night and I had overdone it most every time and freaked out a little bit, so needless to say my tolerance to THC was very low. That night we decided to try some sour rope edibles. Each gummy was like 300 mg so John decided to cut it in half and eat his half and me and someone else split our half so we each ended up with about 75 mg. John had a really high tolerance and I guess didn’t realize that I wouldn’t and told me that it would be perfectly fine. Fast forward about an hour when the edible started to kick in, it came in waves and the first one wasn’t so bad, it felt nice actually even though it hit suddenly like a slap in the face. The second wave was a little stronger and more sudden and had a little anxiety. Then the third wave hit my like a damn semi truck. All of a sudden I’m jumping up from our table like “nope can’t do this” and run inside in a full blown panic attack freaking out. As a few minutes goes by it only gets worse until my fiancé takes me to our bedroom with a bottle of water and sits me on the bed while I’m freaking the hell out. Not only did I think I was dying that night, but I was having an out of body experienced witnessing myself and my fiance sitting on the bed from a Birds Eye view. I don’t remember anything else about that night other than I was knocked on my ass by that edible and lost my absolute shit to say the least. Anyways I just remember waking up the next morning and feeling fine and I called my friends and told them I was okay. Then a few days later I felt the feeling creeping back. It started out slowly with a panic attack or two and by the end of the week I was locked in a non functional psychosis. I was convinced I had rabies, brain tumors, etc. I was completely delusional about anything and everything it was like my life was a constant panic attack 24/7. I couldn’t sleep and when I did I would wake up freezing and shaking violently after only an hour or so. I went to the ER probably 4-5 times that summer just because I was freaking the hell out. I even admitted myself to a psych ward for a few days. I was so dissociated 100% of the time that I would just be doing random things and not realize it. I had to quit my job because I was completely non functional. This lasted for about 3 months before it got any better and then after that i started slowly gradually recovering. To this day, almost a year later I’m not fully recovered but I make progress every day and I feel almost back to normal, though it was a terribly traumatic experience and the hardest part of my life to date.

* 17: fall of 2022, had what I now think was my first hypomanic episode, then just existed for a while, then had the worst depressive episode to date

Diagnosed depression and euphoria ,1,1.0,1716930666.0,"Hey, I'm a 44 yr old with diagnosed depression that I've had since my late teenage years. This has involved a lot of dark thoughts and aggressive outbursts that centre on extreme views of my self worth. Took Citalopram for a long while but it then became ineffective a few years ago. Moved onto duloxetine (SNRI) by a psychotherapist around a year ago and it made the good periods outweigh the bad, but never actually stopped the depressive episodes - only shortened them and increased the time between each dip in mood. Until the latest dip that is, when I noticed I'd felt pretty euphoric for around a week that peaked last Tuesday. So much so that it didn't feel too far off a drug high!

This has got me thinking whether this is typical of depression or is there something else going on as I've always been under the impression/belief that depression doesn't feature euphoric and charged episodes. Not too sure what I am looking for here... Guess it's just having somewhere to say (type) it out loud.

"I can’t feel loved, how do I change?",1,1.0,1716929991.0,"
It’s a long story, so let’s begin.

For as long as I can remember I knew I didn’t fit it. My thinking pattern was different and I never understood my peers. This manifested itself in a very deep rooted insecurity of mine. I couldn’t feel confident or loved. Later in life I was diagnosed with giftedness, ADHD and depression, because why not have it all at the same time am I right. 

When I turned into a adult I starting seeing a guy. Even tho I wasn’t that interested in him, I did invest some time in him, and even lost my virginity to him. Long story short, he got drunk, said I love you, woke up the next morning and suddenly I was disgusting, and we went nc. After that he stalked me for four months straight, kept staring at me whenever I would see him, told his friends something ig, because they can’t see me anymore without laughing or giving me dirty looks, and all while he had a gf, and more.  

I don’t like him, and I don’t want him back into my life, but the sudden change in behavior, and his friends making fun of me really highlighted that old deep rooted insecurity that I am disgusting and impossible to love, to be chosen even. The way I see it, is that he couldn’t be with me (even though it was for the best), got together shortly after with someone else, but still made time to watch/stalk me and making sure his friends are disgusted with me. 

I can’t shake this insecurity. It has been a almost a year, and I am still feeling that same feeling just like 10 months ago. Time is flying by, and I am not present to witness it. Obviously this had to do with not feeling any self love, so how do I learn to truly love myself?

I feel like every time I try to, I get reminded by his friends and him that I don’t deserve it, but I want it to change. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this problem?",mentalhealth,baconblush,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d2ufc7/i_cant_feel_loved_how_do_i_change/,0
"Really freaking myself out, could use some reassurance.",1,1.0,1716929447.0,"Hi everyone,
Not sure if anyone here will be able to help, but my anxiety is causing me to panic. 
I have gotten so many conflicting opinions about what's wrong with me right now, I don't know what to do. 
For context, I've been on Zoloft for 7 years now, I'm on 100mg. 
I've been completely fine on it until recently, when I accidentally missed 3-4 doses within a few weeks time. It has basically caused withdrawal symptoms for the last 2 weeks (constant panic attacks and high anxiety, severe nausea, internal shaking, headaches, muscle spasms, upset stomach). I have been taking it very consistently now since my missed doses, but I'm still having symptoms.

Some people here have told me to just wait it out, but others have mentioned serotonin syndrome, which is REALLY causing me to panic... any advice or reassurance would be greatly appreciated. ❤️

Also, I did CT withdrawal in 2022 (didn't know how stupid it was until it happened) from 200mg  and went through 3 months of hell. 
Reinstated at 100 mg and have been fine on it ever since, right up until 2 weeks ago. ",mentalhealth,Throwaway101496,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d2u7bc/really_freaking_myself_out_could_use_some/,0

i have been able to take melatonin to sleep earlier at night (though it does cause me nightmares) but i’ll end up waking up a few hours later and not able to go back to sleep. then i’ll end up sleeping at like 7am until 4pm. it’s ruining my life cause i can’t stand to cope w my mental health and only know how to sleep to avoid it. other than this is causing me to get nothing done every day, it’s also causing my partner to be sad about having no time w me!

I definitely don’t think I’d withdrawal I’ve had to skip out on it some Monday every so often for some reason or another. All it really is is a bummer if I can’t.

Irritable while healing?,2,1.0,1716914949.0,"I've been in therapy most of my life mostly due to my sexual abuse as a kid that I've had a lot of trouble remembering. After almost going to trial for it, I was really messed up. It was only in the recent year or so I've really started to make the most progress in my life moving forward and past all of this. 

One of my biggest problems was believing myself because if I didn't actively try to remember (and I mean try hard) I didn't really remember it. And then it still almost felt like it was happening to someone else or I'd become hysterical and disassociate. After having lawyers, the person who did, his family, even my family tell me I was lying I really had trouble believing myself. 

Recently I had these really big turning points where I have been able to point out the logic of where it's clear that I'm not making it up (even if it's just validating myself- which is most important to me at this point) and making real strides in recovering my self worth. 

But here's the thing, while I have struggled with living in this constant survival state and finally having points of coming out of it, I also find myself, mostly directly after these big revolutions, that I am extremely irritable and overwhelmed by all sensations. 

To be clear, my PTSD is VERY bad. I haven't worked in years. The abuse I went through was an every day almost captive existence for 4 years that ended 15 years. 

I guess I'm confused as to why something that makes me feel better also causes me to react so strongly negatively too? Any clarification or ideas would be appreciated.

- I dont have empathy, or atleast not much. Someone could say someone died and I could not care in the least.
- My life is boring, almost everything is. I get bored when talking to others, annoyed when having to listen to them.
- I keep thinking about violent things (doesn't fit sociopaths or does it?)
- I do get jealous, I think. Not much, sometimes.
- I dont cry or feel sad unless making myself feel scared or when being afraid. I'm afraid of shots, so I cry. I chat with AI because I want to make myself cry, and I know just how to make myself cry.
- Emotional questions where most people would chose someone else's benefit, I would choose my own. For example ""Who would you save in a building, yourself, a kid, a pregnant woman or family"", ""Would you do this for money"" etc.
- My family doesn't feel like family. I hate my brother, I argue with him a lot.
- I sleep most of the day, and don't care when breaking rules or whatsoever. I also don't care loudly judging someone, like saying they're stupid or just dogs who follow me around. Most people would look at me like I'm crazy, telling me they're right behind me and I shouldnt say that.

Of course I know logically that yes, I do in fact exist. I am here thinking my silly little thoughts in my silly little body. The problem is that it doesn't 'click'. Like knowing something but not really *understanding* it. Or like I - as in *me*, the thinking thing - am just in my brain observing, and my body and what actually interacts with the world is a separate entity. Like a first-person videogame! I do things and I hang out with people and I go to work and my classes but I don't feel like I'm actually there experiencing it in reality. 

This wouldn't be such a problem if it didn't impact my daily life so much. I've made so many poor financial and relationship decisions because I don't feel like it's really happening to me. I doubt my memories because I don't know if they're real or if I made them up. I doubt my senses and I have to keep double and triple checking everything to make sure I didn't trick myself. I forget to look after myself because I forget that I'm a real human with real needs. And it's like I'm looking through a fisheye lens and everything is distorted.

I have to consciously remind myself that I'm real and that I exist to make sure I get off my arse and do the things I need to, but recently the idea that I'm real is scarier than the idea that I'm not. Going outside is getting really difficult because knowing that real people are forming real opinions about me and are actually perceiving and *knowing* me is terrifying. I've tried reaching out to counsellors but I'm too self-aware for it. They just tell me stuff I already know. 

I'm autistic, by the way. Raised female (I'm a transgender man), a high-achiever, high-functioning, high-scoring, hyper-aware of every little thing around me. To be honest, I've probably over-analysed everything to a point that I can no longer see the big picture. Maybe I've doomed myself. 

Honestly, there are a dozen other reasons why I'm having such a hard time, but this is the one I can't seem to shake. I can't seem to find ways to make it so I don't have to consciously tell myself that I'm real every other second. I literally have 'YOU EXIST' written all over my room. I even have it tattooed on me as an on-the-go reminder. Maybe this is part of my OCD?

I am not sure how to help my mother,1,1.0,1716925146.0,"I am not sure how to help my mother

I'm in a tough spot right now and could really use some advice. My mother, who has never been great with money management, finds herself in a difficult situation. She can no longer afford the rent for her apartment, which is over $1000 a month.

A little backstory: My mother stopped working a few years ago and has been living off a combination of money from a pension shared between my father and her, as well as funds she withdrew from her IRA. She suffers from depression and anxiety and is treated with medication for it, but still seems to suffer from it because she just doesn't seek help and waits until a problem is too late to ask for assistance. When I was 19 and still living with her, she went into such a deep depression that she stopped paying rent and doing anything. Our electricity got cut off, and it wasn't until my uncle and aunt stepped in that we were able to live with them for some time. Eventually, my mom got back on her feet and worked again, but now, 11 years later, we are back in what seems like a similar situation. I do not live with her anymore, so she doesn't have my half of the income to help pay for bills.

On top of that, she refuses to work, possibly due to some kind of PTSD and medical issues, which make it difficult for her to stand for long periods of time. She makes a lot of excuses for things regarding work but she will still do housework such as laundry and cleaning just fine. She used to work from home as a patient services rep for a large health care company in our state. She just stopped working one day and never returned. She had FMLA for some time, but that expired a while ago.

I'm really concerned about her well-being and future stability. I want to support her, but I'm not sure what the best course of action is. I've suggested budgeting and seeking financial assistance or counseling, but she's resistant to the idea. I have looked into low-income housing as well but everywhere seems to have a wait-list. I am still currently looking.

I am currently talking to a social worker myself who believes I need to remember that it is not my responsibility to try and change her because ""we cannot change people who do not want to change"". I am afraid of what is going to happen to her.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice on how to approach this? I want to help my mother get back on her feet, but I'm not sure where to start. Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",mentalhealth,Tvirusvixen,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d2sbvu/i_am_not_sure_how_to_help_my_mother/,0
I’m an Idiot Now,1,1.0,1716924919.0,"
I have a problem. I am now stupid. Stupid as fuck. I’m talking embarrass myself every day stupid. 

I used to be smart. Like really smart. I graduated my high school with a 4.3 GPA, and I got into a really good university. The problem is, I was abused my whole life and I didn’t know I had cPTSD, bipolar 2, and borderline personality disorder. And I didn’t know I was autistic. All of these things tore me down when I left for college and I had multiple suicide attempts. I inevitably dropped out. I had been battling with substance abuse issues as well. Alcohol being the first, then I added weed and started doing psychedelics and Molly etc. my brain became so fuzzy. I still drink and smoke weed every day all day when I’m not at work. I space out a lot and I lost my ability to critically think. I used to be really good at puzzles; now I can never get past the first level. I’ve forgotten how to spell. I forget the definition of words I’ve known for years. I can’t remember things that have just been said. I used to study languages and now I can’t remember words no matter how often I use them. I don’t remember books I’ve read or movies or shows I’ve watched. I enjoy them in the moment and then when I’m done I recall almost none of it. When people give me instructions I go blank and I can’t comprehend them. I don’t remember simple math and that includes addition/subtraction. I’ve just forgotten everything I’ve ever learned. Im an idiot now and I hate feeling so stupid and embarrassing myself in front of people. I think it’s a combination of the weed/alcohol use and undiagnosed/untreated bipolar that ruined my brain function. (I always say bipolar chewed on my brain.) 

One of the worst parts of this is that when I try to explain this to my friends they all tell me it’s “normal” and this happens when you grow up. But tell me why my peers don’t struggle in this way. I look so stupid in front of them and they often have to baby me for me to understand things. It’s really really bad and no one is listening to me that it’s an actual debilitating problem. 

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if anyone knows what to do with me.

Psych discontinuing sessions ??? ,2,1.0,1716910423.0,"Just wondering if this is appropriate for a psychologist to do: 

I am currently on workers compensation (psych), so I got referred to a psychologist through this. Just after I made my claim, I fell into a heavy drug addiction for the first time due to all the stress and depression.

My GP and psych have expressed their concerns about this and the support they feel is necessary to treat this issue to the insurer - I do not have private health, so unless I or my family have thousands and thousands of dollars, I have to go through the public system. The insurer has not yet approved or acted on these concerns as they have the ability to provide private treatment for me which would be ideal in my situation. 

Last time I saw my GP, she was a lil harsher on me as “I’m not doing anything to help myself”. I have done nothing but ring and enquire about public detox facilities and rehabs. There is only 1 public detox facility in my whole city, they have a big waiting list and all the public rehabs are not doing intake as they too have long waiting lists. 

I have only started using around 3 months ago. The first thing I did was tell my doctor, I feel something a lot of addicts may struggle to do for a while. I believe reaching out for help is the first step to take in addiction. My doctor and psychologist have been telling me I can walk into this specific hospital and be admitted for addiction? They only provide outpatient AOD services. My GP also insists that I need inpatient detox, psychiatry etc - the whole package. After speaking to a lady today; she informed me that at the one detox clinic I am able to go to, there is no psychiatrist or clinical support there. She also advised that I cannot just be admitted to the hospital for addiction. 
A lot of the day programs around here require you to be clean for 6 months etc. 

I saw my psych yesterday for the SECOND time, she stated that she feels these sessions are not “beneficial” for me, that I am not helping myself and she can’t do anything for me until I get other support???? Aren’t psychologists meant to talk to you about the issues you are facing in life?? Come up with strategies or simply be just someone who can listen and understand??? Addiction usually stems from trauma etc, shouldn’t a psychologist try to unravel this and build rapport with me??? Here I am, seeing a clinical psychologist, unable to just get help overnight, taking small steps in order to progress with professional help, running on a narrative that isn’t even true!! The lady on the phone said to me today “they need to get in touch with reality”. You would think psychologists and doctors who have spent years studying to work in this industry, would have some sort of idea on how shitty the public mental health system is. 

I honestly feel so let down at this point! I feel like I’m going to snap. Why the pressure is being put on me so much instead of the insurer, is not fair. I have never felt so misunderstood EVER

Does anyone else get annoyed when someone does something nice for them unsolicited? ,2,1.0,1716907115.0,"I’ve been doing some deep reflecting on myself lately and I can’t tell if I’m a bad person. 

I’ve found myself feeling inwardly annoyed when someone does something for me without me asking. 

Ex. On a recent trip with my husband’s family we arrived at the beach house and as we were bringing our bags in his sister insisted she take one of my bags from my hand and help me take it upstairs. It was well within my means to carry it myself and it made me feel awkward. 

Towards the end of the trip, his mom requested that we not leave early as we originally planned, but to stay until checkout to “help them pack.” Now this may be skewed only child feelings coming out in me, but I didn’t understand why they suddenly needed our help packing when they easily unpacked their car for the trip themself. Am I not helping to leave the beach house as we found it by taking my own belongings? Am I weird for not assuming automatically that they may need our help packing? Because literally it does not occur to me to help other people to pack to leave vacation when they did it themself leaving to go to it.

I just can’t stop feeling like maybe there’s a broken spot inside me because some people are so quick to want to help someone and that just doesn’t come natural to me. 

I don’t think of myself as a spoiled only child. My parents made sure to make me carry my own weight around the house growing up. I just have this feeling that I’m responsible for my own stuff and I don’t expect others to help me.

Stop obsessing,1,1.0,1716919810.0,"I have undoubtedly always felt like I was strange and socially awkward, but lately I have become obsessed with the idea of turning over every stone and trying to fix every little thing inside my house - a house that has been around a lot longer than me and has stood without my intervention. When I feel something needs to be fixed, I cannot focus on anything else, including my wife and kids, and will continue to obsess over it until I'm able to begin the task. At times the anxiety is so high that I become irritable, and I will lash out at anyone that ""bothers"" me in these moments. Once I actually start the work I become hyperfocused and can work on a task for hours, without a break, and without thinking about anything or anyone else. While starting the work offers relief it also introduces another stress factor - now I'm working against time, so I must work as fast as possible, I must finish before my wife or kids need me. If I don't finish I become frustrated and will continue to obsess over the unfinished project until I can resume it later.

The other night before bed I noticed that one of 3-way switches in the hallway didn't work properly. At 10:00 PM this resulted in me shutting off the breaker, taking out the switches to investigate, and running between the panel flipping the power on and off so I could test which switch the power came into. When my wife asked what the fuck I was doing (understandably at this hour) I lashed out and she went to bed upset. I ended with a two-hour YouTube binge on light switches. I feel like any normal person would have just ignored it until the next day, or all together, like the previous owner.

On top of this I am often irrationally anxious over every little thing that might cause something to break. When my kids are playing on the floor all I can think about is how it's going to get scratched. If they drop something my first thought is that the floor is dented, and not if they hurt themselves. If they stubbornly slam a door or crank the door handle too hard, I will get upset. I don't like them running around or jumping as it may stress the underlying floor. I get nervous whenever they carry a plate or glass of milk, fearing they may drop it. Normal people don't think this way. I worry I'll instill this general sense of unease in them.

As you can imagine I am not the most pleasant person to be around during these times and it will often lead to me getting angry with my wife or children because they're either impeding my progress, or doing something that I don't like. I am aware that it is a problem, and it bothers me, but I cannot overcome it. This is not the kind of father or husband I want to be. I wish I could just be this happy-go-lucky father able to focus on the more important things in life. Instead, I'm always carrying this immense anxiety and tension which in turn affects my family. My children see this behavior and I fear that I might have, or will, mess them up.

I can say that my family struggles with mental health very frequently and have had issues with suicide/suicidal thoughts as well as severe depression, including myself. However, my brother who is in the army has reached a new low. He and I haven’t had the best relationship at all really (long story). But he’s still my brother. 

Right now he’s been with this girlfriend who’s been contacting my parents and I to let us know about his poor mental health. Supposedly, he’s been drinking insane amounts of alcohol and doing coke with some “friends” to the point he’s blackout and falling asleep on the floor by the time she wakes up. He’s been borrowing loads of money from my parents to pay off rent and other fees, as well as treating them the same way I remember growing up, aka poorly and ungrateful. His girlfriend and he have had arguments where he just shouts at her which has led to near breakups but it seems he always threatens and tells her that he’s going to commit suicide but he has “some things he needs to take care of first”. He doesn’t answer any of my texts nor my parents so it’s hard to get in touch with him and even if we do, he brushes everything off like it’s fine and nothing's wrong. He refuses to get help or take any medication which makes things much harder as he also compares alcohol similar to anti-depressants. 

Recently, he was charged for being AWOL as he didn’t show up to work one day. Thankfully, after he told his girlfriend he was planning to start the car in the garage, she told one of his higher-ups in the army that he was suicidal and was thankfully put on suicide watch. She has told me not to tell my parents this or act like I know if I get in touch with him because he'll only get even more angry at her but even then it seems he’ll never talk to me either way. Like I said, he never answers my texts or calls and rarely answers my parents. Even if he does he’ll just lie about everything going on in his life. Bless my parents as they’ve both dealt with enough pain in their lives, but they don’t exactly know how to approach others when it comes to theirs and I’m sure it would destroy them if anything were to truly happen to him.

Resurfacing Repressed Memories ,1,0.99,1716917518.0,"I think around mid-2022, repressed memories mostly from my school days started resurfacing and I've been ruminating about the same negative memories since. It's properly processing them with anger instead of shame and seeing some things in a new light but they've been taking turns and my reaction to them is always the same. They haven't crossed my mind in the years since they happened but for the past 2 years, anything would trigger a negative memory/ppl that otherwise wouldn't. 

I miss having thoughts of other things when my mind's idle. I miss when my mind didn't use to connect things to negative memories. I miss when the past was just in the past and I moved on with my life or so I thought. I used to be able to read in peace but negative memories that are mostly unrelated play out now.

When I got compliments I feel uncomfortable, like someone is gonna use me as they know I am good at it. This is somehow I do automatically now, and I think it backfired at me.

Some scenes I remember while growing up is that, my Aunt used to ask us me or my siblings to make coffee, at first I am really competitive about it, like I would really make it to her taste and she would compliment me, then later I found myself became her favorite errand little boy. Then I stopped being always available.


Another, I was good at computer/gadgets in years like 2005 and I was just a small boy then, I always got complimented, but always be the one picked when somethings wrong about any new technology devices at our house or friends house, so I started saying I don't know this, I don't know that. As I saw my siblings playing and me? always get picked.

And so on ... then I got used to it, and everytime I help someone now, and get compliments about how good I am at this and that, I get uncomfortable, I just smile and I don't wanna get lots of attention, or don't want others to might hear it. Sometimes I just say I don't know or I'm not available.

but man, I feel guilt inside rejecting it, like I would think about it for days even if its just a small thing I rejected. But again I am not comfortable helping sometimes even when I am available, sort  of I feel used sometimes.

I even minimized what I know even in class before, even when I know, I won't go toss myself at front just to show what I know. Til I am used on saying ""I don't know"" to lots of things...

In 2019 I took one hit of my friends vape, it had THC in it. They were vaping it all day and nothing happened to them besides getting high, when I asked to try it they gave it, and i felt no reaction after the first hit, I took the second hit and inhaled it more deeply before exhaling. Immediately within 10seconds I became high and extremely panicky, i felt lightheaded and as if i was in a dream. This effect lasted 1-2 hours but after that i could still ""feel"" it. I think I had ptsd for 1 whole year from this, and never got it treated. Whenever I'd hear the words ""vape"" or ""thc"" I'd get dizzy and panic. But I'm fine now although I still get triggered slightly. Few months later, I used one of those elf bars, (I used to smoke these a lot and nothing would happen) but since that incident I was traumatised, anyways I took one hit of the elf bar and it reminded me of that day and I became dizzy again and lightheaded and the ptsd affected me very bad. Anyways the trauma lasted many months to a year like I would feel numb every single day and no emotion, something didnt feel right but after some months it eventually faded. But I'd still get triggered when I heard the words vape etc. Start of 2021 I mostly healed, and had no symptoms, at all!!!! But end of 2022 I started getting those symptoms again randomly and didnt know why, I had no thoughts of the 2019 incident but i was feeling very weird and off. Anyways since the symptoms returned in 2022 I've never felt ""normal"" since, up until 2024 I'm still feeling weird. It matches with what I believe to be dpdr. I'm very scared, has this permanently damaged my brain or something. Will I ever heal? Every single day nothing feels real to me, i feel like I'm constantly dreaming, and now when I think about it my current symptoms kind of match with the incident I had in 2019, even tho i never think about this day i feel it. Have i damaged myself? Or is it all mental and treatable pls help....

Which is Worse: Trying to Make Friends or Having No Friends? ,1,1.0,1716911571.0,"I (31 F) can't decide if it's worse trying to make friends or having no friends? I am Neurodivergent and I've moved around a lot in my life since I was a kid so I got good at small talk, assimilating and finding common interests so I can usually start a conversation and make people like me at first but I really struggle with the development of friendships. 

It's hard enough finding friends as a parent but when I do make friends I try to pull people together and introduce them to other people who have kids the same age and it never fails that they will become really good friends and then I end up being left out. I try setting up playdates or doing fun things but will get turned down because they are busy. I try not to think much of it since everyone is busy but then I will see on Facebook posts of them and their kids together at different events. It's a double blow knowing that me and my kids are being left out and the kids really get along so I feel like the only reason we aren't being invited is because the mom's must not like me. 

My husband suggests that I keep pushing and make more of an effort to include myself in things and try harder to invite them to do things but each rejection hurts more and then them not inviting us to go do anything says a lot about how they feel about me. I don't want to be the friend that is only involved because they force themselves into situations that people don't want them in. I want to be in friendships where I'm wanted. 

It hurts not having any friends and not even one close friend but it's also really painful each time I'm rejected and being left out. I even try opening up and being relatable and mentioning wanting close friends and feeling bad when me or my kids are left out of stuff and feeling like it's my fault. I know that can sound really whiny but I mentioned it in a conversation where the moms were talking about how hard it is to make friends so I felt like it was a good time to put my bid for friendship out there to let them know I am open.

I have a lot of body hair, a lot, and that makes me super dysphoric.

I usually try to take it off, from my face by shaving and from my torso and stomach with cold wax, I have a lot so it hurts like hell, still I do it because it's worse to see it everyday. 
I can't usually do it because my boyfriend prefers when I have body hair, so most times I just keep it, I barely ever shave my legs or arms, even tho it makes me feel so ugly and repulsive I can't even look at myself for more than 2 seconds.

I thought about, maybe, getting my hair removed with laser, I'd love to do it on my arms, legs, torso, face and stomach, but for my boyfriend I'd only do it on my face.

Today I looked at the prices and you best believe there's no fucking way I can afford it, not today, not in years, and that's only my face! If I ever decided to make it full body, which I doubt but still, then I'd have to wait practically half of my life or more for it.

I don't really know how to process it, my hair grows back every day, I shave every fucking day, even sometimes I have to do it twice.

It makes me want to die, it makes me want to puke and got to sleep and not get up ever fucking again, I hate myself, I hate my hair, if I could tear my skin apart and make my body restore it without hair I would do it, no hesitation, even without fucking anesthesia.

How do you get out of a toxic relationship?,1,1.0,1716910415.0,"Hi. I am recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Recently, it had been getting out of hand. My trigger is my relationship with my boyfriend (28M).

I wanted to get out of our relationship for a year now. But he won't let me and I honestly find it hard to let go.

Throughout the course of our relationship, I never felt heard. He does things I hate and hangs out with the people who bullied me. Even though we agreed not to communicate with them or at least keep it casual or work-related only. Btw, we used to work together but I quit because of the bullying and he sided with them before. He told he was scared because he will still be working there. I guess that's valid?

He gaslights and twist stories. He raped me at the beginning of the relationship, he made me do things I didn't want. I thought that was love. He emotionally cheated but I'm not sure if he even had physically cheated because now I have cold sores. I don't even know what is real anymore. I doubt myself in everything. I held on to some glimmer of hope that he would change. And now, I have depression and anxiety, abandonment issues and suicidal thoughts. Been harming myself and having outburst that lasts for at least 6 hours. My throat hurts for screaming so much. I felt that he won't stop until I kill myself, so I put a knife to my neck and told him to stop or I'll stop all of this myself. He said ""Up to you"". I lost consciousness then.

I got so violent and became harm-inflicting on myself and my things. He owes me money, and won't pay back if I break up. He would involve my friends and family. He comes to my house. Says stuff and does things to woe me back. I am scared of the consequences if I don't agree because he would scream and get violent with the stuff around. I want to get out of this trauma bond.

How to cope with an unfulfilling life (~ age 10 to 27) caused by caused by parental setbacks ?,1,0.67,1716910251.0,"(M27) As a kid and teen, I my parents kept me from having the ideal American social life. They moved w/ me from a relatively high COL area where opportunities for social activities and interests were ample, to a shitty and backward rural town of 7,000. And the scant few social activities and opportunities to pursue my interests were things they thought were dangerous (football, hunting)- which my friends wanted me to do with them- and so I didn’t get to do them. And they didn’t let me go to a church I wanted that had kids my age. They did put me in karate, but I didn’t like that. All of this led to depression and anxiety, which led to being vulnerable to bullying and even led me to being vulnerable to dating-related (couldn’t get a gf) bullying from age 10-12, which led to anorexia at age 12. Sure, they paid for my hospitalization, which saved me, and put me in the right mental care afterward to get help diagnosing my problems, but they brought all these issues on me by making me disconnected with my peers. Their philosophy is basically “tough work, fuck happiness, work hard or you’re worthless” (maybe a bit toned down from that, but it’s essentially that). They put me on medications that did way more damage for me mentally and physically than was the written purpose for them (horrible acne, weight gain, lethargy, leaky bladder, slowed cognitive speed, shaky hands, anxiety). They didn’t help me prepare for college, and instead made me work for a car from 10th to 12th grade, which, with all these present depressing things, made me unable to relate to people my age and kept me out of being able to go to college until 25 yo. They let me live with them until 25 as I worked FT (to afford college) and have helped me with other things I’ve needed, like groceries and having some financial help with some expenses. And they still provide cellular service and car insurance for me, since I’m in college. But they ruined my ability to have a social life and get into dating for years to come AND never acknowledged this. It’s like colonial Europe economically screwing over Africa in the long term, but out of unexplained hateful internal feelings instead of a fear of rivalry (my dad’s dad was similarly out of touch with him and not present in his life, so maybe he drew that animosity from that). I’ll be honest, I hate him. I had to gradually get myself off my meds without medical advice (bc I can’t afford insurance) to offset the horrible side effects caused by them (weight gain, shaky hands, lethargy, dulled cognitive speed). I’m now mostly lean, too, partly due to this. I want to cut them off after college. I think they need to know they fucked up as people, and I don’t want to remain in a weird state of dependence on them. To finally be able to have a fulfilling social life and have a relationship. Everyone else in college seems like they had much richer social lives and better family lives growing up, and that saddens me. I relate well to depressed male characters with non-present fathers in pop media like Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender) and Kratos (God of War).

Is it wrong to wish for a different illness to happen to you instead of what you currently have?,2,1.0,1716894067.0,"For context, I have MDD, anxiety, and BPD with a possibility of PTSD. I'm doing DBT therapy and one-to-one therapy with a therapist, and taking medication as prescribed.

However, dealing with ignorant people and their comments takes a toll on me. I've heard people talk about me behind my back. I've been told to just not be sad (gee why didn't I think of that /sarcasm). I've been told to stop my meds cold turkey or that they're the cause of my illnesses.

So sometimes I wish that I had cancer instead. 

This could very well be a BPD symptom, but don't I *deserve* to receive the same overflow of affection as someone with a different type of chronic illness??? Don't I matter, even if I have something more or less invisible? I don't want *things* either!

"I don't feel real, I feel so detached from my own self",2,1.0,1716881880.0,"I am 19 F and I want to know what is wrong with me. Disclaimer: English is not my first language and I tried my best to make it understandable.

I feel like I'm not real sometimes. Who am I, and who are these several personas that I constantly playing? Every day at the end of the day, I feel empty like a nobody. This is why I hate going home alone and prefer staying a bit in school.

I have many friends and they all like me but in the end of the day, I always feel out of place and feel like I'm not really a part of a friend group. Every day when I talk to my friends, it feels like something that happens on autopilot.  I replayed the things that I did and asked myself, ""I'm not like that, why am I acting like this?"" It's like seeing from a third perspective and seeing my own stupid actions. Cringing at every possible action *I* could think of.

I am not aware of  who I am as a person. I crafted it by stealing other people's personalities, and for some reason, it works. Everyone seem to like me as a weird person, romantic person, funny person, nerdy person etc.

Sometimes I wish I could just shut up and detach these personalities, but if I will. I feel like an empty husk of flesh, the same very feeling everytime I come home from school and I just stare at the horizon thinking everyone hates me because I acted the wrong personality, but it'd be weird if I switch it again so I have to stick with this.

It's fun asking people how they see me in their eyes. Instead of thinking deeper inside you, you ask another people's opinion and their insight is like a feedback and update my gears. ""Oh they like it like that"" and when someone hates a part of me I start to detach on that emotion and make me hate myself.

How can I say that ""I'm not like that"" when I can't even comprehed of who I am? I don't even know how to express all my feelings. I don't know how to sympathize if someone vents to me. How can I say ""you're fine, I'm here"" without saying like a sarcastic robot.

Although I feel like I can stop, I just can't. It's as though I'm entertaining for someone, and if I don't behave in this way, I feel as though I have no place. 

But I feel emotions, like happiness and all however, it sometimes feels like they are coming from a whole another personality and not from me entirely.

But I don't want people to view me as a fake friend. It's not really like that. It's more of me having trouble to express something so I mask it with a DIY crafted personality that fits with what I'm feeling atm. 

This may sound contradictory but the most I feel like myself is when I'm alone. Just me. Like today I felt so surreal when I ran under the heavy rain and laughed maniacally. It felt true happiness.

Call me OA or edgy for saying this but I don't think it's a joke anymore. I've been thinking like this ever since 6th grade. I thought it's just a normal thing but the more I meet with people, the more I think that it's not normal. They all have consistent personalities and can express it well while I don't.

I dont really know if I make sense, i tried to make it a bit understandable. I really want to know what is wrong with me and I would love to know everybody's insights about it. Thank you everyone.

How to persuade somebody to get help?,2,1.0,1716881705.0,"hi,
I have a sister who is sunk in negative and sad thoughts. She blames everything and everybody, in the past and in the present, for her ""misfortunes"" in life. She blames my mom for her being poor. And of course she blame me too, for a lot of things. 

I only have highschool diploma, but I work very hard to give my children better access to living condition than what I had. (My mom was poor and uneducated and worked as household helper). Now that my son has better resources than what we had back then, she envies my son. And she envies many people and stuck in the cycle of blaming the poor condition when we grew up. 

She doesn't want to work anymore because she had a failed relationship with her boyfriend (who later married her co-worker).
She thinks my wife and I are not helping/loving her enough. 

She would lock herself in her room and cry sometimes for days. We already put dangerous things away from her room (scissors, box cutter, nail clipper).

This makes our family sad, especially my mom. 
When we tell her something, she would think we scold her for it. We are not scolding or blame her for anything. 
I think she is suffering under depression. But everytime we brought up the topic of getting help, she would be angry. She would accuse me of labeling her ""crazy"" and want to send her away.

Did I do anything wrong?,1,1.0,1716892054.0,"

A year ago, I lost my IT job. I asked my housemate, whom I have been living with for four years and had a good relationship with, for a job. He is an assistant manager. He gave me a job, and everything was going well. He gave me a receptionist position when one of the staff members resigned. I did very well and got loads of compliments. During this time, he was very abusive towards me. He used to swear at me and gave me tasks that weren't mine. But since he helped me, I did everything he told me to do. There were many instances where he would tell me to do this or I would be fired. I never said no to anything. The work became so overwhelming that it tested my human limits. Every day I needed a small nap after work because it was so tiring.

My manager knew I used to work in IT and asked me for help with tech issues, which I resolved. She wanted me to work in the IT department, so she referred me. They liked my resume and asked me for an interview. I told my housemate/assistant manager that I was going for an interview. He said that was okay. Then, three weeks ago, he asked me if I wanted to do a dual role as a receptionist and in admissions. I replied that I was waiting for a response from the IT department because I thought I should move there. He said okay.

Last week, my manager came to me and said she was going to send me interstate for training with the IT department. My housemate was on COVID leave that week. On Monday, my manager told my housemate that she was going to send me to another state for a week of training and had updated me. I didnt tell my housemate. My housemate/assistant manager fumed. As soon as I showed up for work, he started yelling at me, saying, ""This is why I don't give jobs to people like you. I have been treating you so well, and you did this to me."" I replied that I had already told him what was going on and that nothing had been finalized regarding moving interstate for just one week. I hadn't received tickets, dates, or any other information. There was no need to be abusive because I had been updating him at every stage. He has been abusing me, saying things like, ""We live together, you talk to me about everything, and now you don't tell me this."" Now he has completely stopped talking to me. I think I should have told him, but in my mind, I felt like he is the assistant manager, so he will be in contact with the manager soon and they will finalize and let me know. I am feeling very guilty. Did I do anything wrong?

Can you please guide me in changing my thinking process? ,1,1.0,1716887347.0,"

Hi! I've always noticed that the things, goals, or people I wanted in my life so badly somehow never came to fruition. In my childhood, I accepted this casually. But since 2020, it seems like something is always holding me back from achieving what I desire.

Currently, I'm pursuing an engineering degree in CSE, but I don't feel any motivation to complete it, even though I used to be a good student. I wanted to get into my desired institution so badly, but my boyfriend broke up with me the day before my admission test. I couldn't focus the next day and, as a result, didn't get in. I loved him so much that I waited for his return for two years after our breakup. I barely moved on and got used to his absence.

Then, I met someone who was intelligent and shared my imaginative thinking. We decided to get married at the end of the year, and I introduced him to my family. However, he decided that my family wouldn't accept his drug addiction, and I wouldn't be able to handle it either. So, he wanted to break up. For the past five months, we haven't been in touch. I had a panic attack a few days ago and called him, but he didn't respond and told me to accept that we are no longer together.

I have many things to do in my life right now. I should start my GRE preparation because I want to pursue a Ph.D. in the USA. I also got an internship offer yesterday, which starts in September. My university GPA is still below 3 out of 4, so I need to study hard to improve it. But I can't seem to do any of this. I always feel so numb and worthless. I can't sleep without taking 3-4 sleeping pills. If I don't take them, my panic attacks start. I feel paralyzed, my chest feels heavy, and these episodes last for 6-7 hours. A few months ago, it took 20 minutes to recover, but now it's getting worse. I even tried to commit suicide, but I'm afraid of failing and being judged.

I don't know what to do now. Can anyone please help me out?

Neglect and trapped no support,1,1.0,1716885412.0,"
I grew up in Forster care. Before that I lived with my siblings with my mum. We didn’t have a lot of money because of her. She had a habit of giving all the money that was supposed to be used to feed us children to other people. She would literally send all the money to other family members. When she did have enough money to buy food she spent it on feeding herself. This made me hate her growing up so much. Especially because we were in pain from hunger and she would eat so disgustingly loud. This was when I was around 8 years old. When I went into foster care I never spoke to her after. Despite this she would constantly stalk me online and send me the most awful messages telling me how she hates me even though I never did anything to her. 

Despite everything I decided to forgive her and contact her on Mother’s Day last year when I was 26 years old. Ever since then she’s trapped me in a house with her and makes me spend all my money on her. She now owes me £10,000 and she keeps saying she’ll pay me back but it’s been over a year now and still nothing. She says that she’s owed compensation of around £20,000 and it should be here soon but I’m really worried that she’s not paying me back. Regarding the money I spend now, I’ve been forced into buying her all new furniture and everything down to the food. I feel like giving up because noone seems to help. When I buy the food, she has been doing what she did to us in childhood, eating all our food and not leaving us any at all. I’ve become so baffled and shocked that a mother would allow herself to eat first before her kids in a poverty situation never mind eating and not leaving any for them.  I don’t know why but this creates so much hate in me it’s unreal. I wish my mum was never alive. She’s the most evil person I have ever met. When we went into foster care she would walk around the whole city begging and crying to people for help to get her children back and now she treats us like crap taking advantage of us again it us so unbearably hard 

I can’t leave because I’ve spent all my money on her and she begs me not to leave otherwise she’ll end her life. She’s so toxic. If I ignore her like people have told me to she calls the police making up horrific stories like I’m trying to kill her and this even managed to get me arrested before. She even looked me in the eyes when she called them and said some horrific things like I was in her bedroom beating her up (I was not even in her room and I was not beating her or anywhere near her). 

Then when the police aren’t around she starts begging me to come back again and how sorry she is like she did when I didn’t talk to her growing up. When I come back because I can’t live on the street and I have no money she does this again and again.

Why is it difficult to control my head and body movements?,1,1.0,1716883890.0,"Since I was about 11 years old, I began to notice things like not being able to control my head. I would have tics, or sudden head movements. As I got older, it has been getting worse. The subtle head nods and tics have turned into uncontrollable body movements. Now, I can control myself if I constantly remind myself to. And when I go to work or when I used to go to school, I'd be able to control myself 95% of the time but there were times when I acted out and forgot to control myself and I would be afraid if people thought I was maybe weird or just autistic.

I am 21 years old now, and although I am probably not autistic (I honestly don't think I am, and neither do my family), I have always been able to control my body. But over the years it has been getting harder to control, so much harder especially over the past couple of years and it seems like it might just be getting worse. It got really bad from the age of 17 and onwards.

When I'm at home sitting down on my phone or laptop or doing something like making food or even driving, my head constantly nods and moves and I have to constantly remind myself to focus and not do it. And it works, but only for a minute or so then I go back into doing it. My body does the same thing and it's unbearable most of the time. I feel my hands moving on their own like it's drying to dodge something, my legs move like it has tourettes, and it just feels harder. I cant control my eyes and mouth sometimes, it just moves on its own and I have no idea why. Sometimes I feel like things are touching me, things that are not there but I feel it inside me sometimes and its unbearable that I punch holes in the walls in my room and have thoughts of k\*lling myself.

What's so confusing about all of this, is that I am still in my right mind and I am sure I'm not autistic or anything like that. I am still fully aware and in control of myself, and when these things happen I am able to stop immediately but its hard to keep it constant. But I feel things that shouldn't be there and its like my body is moving on its own, my head nods and nods and doesn't stop, my hands feel things inside it and tries to dodge whatever it's feeling like its trying to get away from something and I have to constantly remind myself not to do it. My family don't think much of it but they have told me that I should probably see a psychiatrist.

I am probably planning to see a neurologist or a psychiatrist one day, but I'd like to just openly share what I've been dealing with since childhood and please let me know if any of you have an idea of what may be wrong with me.

Friend's Delusions Are Getting Worse and I'm Across the Country,4,1.0,1716846889.0,"Hi everyone,

I'm concerned about a friend of mine who is increasingly delusional. I've known him for years, and over the past few, his mental state has been deteriorating. He opened up to me the other day and what he had to say was very concerning.  He has deep apophenia, to the point where he’s legally changed his name based on his delusions.

I tried to speak to the only family member I know he has, and they wouldn’t take my call. So I wrote them a detailed message but they brushed off my concerns, saying that he's fine. This doesn't sit right with me, as I see him getting worse and I'm worried for his safety and well-being.

I live on the other side of the country and I'm too broke to help him in person. I'm looking for advice on how to support him from afar. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

Unsure what to call an episode,2,1.0,1716859200.0,"I had an episode of *something* in late 2017 to early 2018. Up until now I've thought of it as a depressive episode, but now I'm not so sure, so I was hoping someone could advise what actually happened?

So before starting school in September 2017 (I was 13M at the time), I had this ""epiphany"". I thought if a particle is sent back in time, that'd prove the existence of parallel universes, and hence infinite universes with infinite possibilities. I managed to read somewhere about soneobe in the LHC sending an electron back in time, which I thought proved my theory. I was 13, gimme a break.

Then my thoughts went to the infinite possibilities, and thought that if we had found a way to send a particle back in time and observe the effects, there must be a way to harness this concept to view other universes. With infinite possibilities, this would have already been done by infinite already been done infinitely. Hence, there must be at least one universe that is watching you at all times, reading all of your thoughts, like reality TV.

SO. I spent about 5 months genuinely believing that my entire existence was being watched for entertainment by a world of aliens in a parallel universe.

Obviously this had effects on me. I started considering myself pointless and worthless, I isolated from my friends because why stay with them and entertain the masses. My sleep schedule got even worse, I had so little energy. I kept myself from ending things by imagining how distraught my family would be, but that didn't stop me from self-harming once.

I stopped believing this in January 2018, but the damage had already been done mentally and socially. I was lucky that a teacher noticed my isolation and convinced some people in my maths class to talk to me in April of that year. They're still my friends to this day, and I am so thankful to them and that teacher.

So that's the story. I'm not sure how to think of it, whether to think of it as a depressive episode, as a delusional episode. Depressive episode caused by a delusion? I guess I'm just confused, so if anyone has any advice I'd be really grateful.

TL;DR I spent 5 months thinking I was nothing more than entertainment for aliens in a parallel universe, which made me feel worthless, isolate myself, and self-harm. What?",mentalhealth,Tibtib04,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d27mzo/unsure_what_to_call_an_episode/,1
I'm scared (TW),1,1.0,1716872159.0,"I'm not sure what to do, and I know that saying this online to a bunch of strangers isn't going to help but I felt like typing it out somewhere.

I've struggled with self-harm and suicdal thoughts(and attempts) in the past. For a while I've been doing pretty good, no major self-harm(I've relapsed a couple times but nothing too big), no attempts, I was happier than usual and it was fucking great. I was using a technique where I planned something I was really exited for and would be able to look forward to doing it, things like concerts, conventions, etc.

I live in a very rural area and am a minor who doesn't have a drivers license or a car, so I can't go many places. Me and one of my friends just went to the convention that we had planned about a year ago, and it was amazing. I made friends, did karaoke, cosplayed, danced, had a great time in general. However, it's over now. I don't have any more plans, I can't make more because there's nothing to do.

I'm scared. I'm relapsing again, and I don't want to kill myself, but I might kill myself because I don't know if I want to be alive, and I don't know what to do. I'm scared of myself and of everyone around me, and I don't know what to do about it because I can't talk to anyone I know without messing everything up. I'm scared that I  ruined everything for my friends just by bringing up mental health before. 

Also, while this isn't as important, it's probably contributing to this. While at the convention, a pedophile started hitting on me, and saying creepy things, knowing that I was a minor. He asked me and my friend weird questions, like what self defense weapons we had, then started explaining how he could still kidnap us even with the weapons. It was weird, and gave me huge PTSD from being groped by pedos when I was younger. Like I said, this isn't the main thing, but it's probably contributing to it.

Now that the convention is over, I'm stuck in a house that's nowhere near any of my friends. I don't know what to do and I'm relapsing again. I'm scared that i'm going to kill myself, not immediately, but gradually.

It's mostly felt that way but recently I've been spiralling mentally and I honestly don't know how much more I can take.

We broke up like 7 or 8 years ago. It was tough, I loved her and still do (not romantically I think but just as a person) but I did eventually find someone, got married had a child and I'm happy with my new partner, I really am, that's why I feel so shit and guilty.

The last \~2 years of my life have been a roller coaster, my sister died, I bottled it up and moved forward and occupied my mind with other things. It was the single hardest thing I ever had to endure and for a while I just ignored it, gained weight and pretty much got addicted to pornography (despite my partner always being there for me emotionally and sexually).

At the start of this year I went on vacation with my family after over a year of not wanting to live. I enjoyed it, a lot. Since getting back I've gotten back into shape and feel the best I've felt physically since like 5 years ago. Everything in my life seemed to be going in the right direction until two weeks ago.

I'm not sure about my sense of self,1,1.0,1716864492.0,"TL;DR: I often feel disconnected from my own identity, imagining myself from an outsider's perspective rather than imagining being ""me"". This doesn't seem to affect others, but I struggle to fully embrace my adulthood, despite doing typical adult relatively well activities like studying and working. Interactions with older adults make me feel like I revert to a younger version of myself, impacting my sense of maturity and masculinity. While I used to think my friends grew up too fast, I now feel like I'm lagging behind in maturity.



(20M) Not too sure how to explain this thought, but basically, when I think of myself in my head, I'm not quite sure I tend to think as ME. I sort of think of me from the POV of someone observing me.

Like if I was imagining myself say on a date, or in a fight, or bowling, it's not my POV but kind of just outside. I don't think it's akin to depersonalization. I think I just haven't come to terms with reality of real world. 

Sometimes I still don't recognize that I'm an adult who does adult things. I am at university so I do the usual, studying, partying, working, etc., but sometimes I have to sit down and remember that I am now one of the adults that I used to see walking around when I was young. That realization is a little crazy. This doesn't seem to affect those around me much, but I feel stuck in a nostalgic state kind of. They've embraced their adulthood, talking to grown-ups with 10+, 20+ years on them as though they're on the same level of experience, etc. However, when I have conversations with older adults (especially those who were around when I was young), I feel as though I instinctively revert to my younger mannerisms and don't exactly present as a grown man. 

Although they would likely say I come off well put-together and mature, I just don't feel like it helps from a masculinity standpoint. In High-school, years ago, I used to feel as though my friends grew up too fast, insisting on doing PG/R-rated activities;; now I feel as though I'm not growing up fast enough.

He was mildly physically abusive and extremely emotionally and verbally abusive and they were together for about 5ish years and they have been separated for a maybe a year and a half now. I'm the first guy she's trusted in that year and a half and we've spent the last year being friends on and off. About a month ago things started really kicking off a bit and moved really fast but she was still nervous about getting into something new but was still wanting to give it a go because we've grown to have significant feelings for each other. Well at the of that month where things kicked off she kind of shut down hard and was basically telling me her feeling she had just went away and we talked about it a bit and we believe it was really just her trauma response telling her to retreat likely because things were moving so fast and it freaked her out. Another reason she said she wanted to cut things off was because she feels broken and knows if we continue then it'll be a roller-coaster ride of wanting it and not wanting it and I reassured her that that was okay and I'm 100% here to support her through her healing in whatever way I can so after all that she decided she wanted to keep seeing each other but go at a very slow pace.

I have bpd and i split about 4 months ago and ever since then I've been constantly dissasociating its getting to the point where my short term memory is almost non existent. it's frustrating I find moments where I'm with friends and I'll randomly just start crying because I feel like i cannot connect to the situation.

Spouse in Crisis - I need Support Too,1,1.0,1716861803.0,"This last year+ has been the hardest of my life. Just looking for some emotional encouragement and reassurance for me so I can try to be there for him. 

My (30+F) spouse (30+M) has been struggling with his mental health for years. We had started with a couples counselor 3 years ago, and granted they were not a good fit, knowing how challenging it was to find anyone during Covid we stuck with them far longer than we should have. 

Covid was a major turning point and the struggle he faced during/after the immediate lockdown finally helped me to convince him to seek support individually. He found a psychiatrist he started working with. About a year after that he finally disclosed that he has been secretly struggling with an opiate addiction without my knowledge. That was a year ago. 

This last year has had a decline in our relationship, connection, and a continued decline in his own mental health. Even a recent multi week long evening therapy program has not enabled him to find any satisfaction or feeling of improvement in his own mental health. 

I am struggling to see the hope or light at the end of the tunnel that he is going to find a program or support system to help him through. 

Each round of intervention (couples counselor, psychiatrists, therapists, IOP) has only happened after weeks and months of me asking and begging him to give it a try. 

I am so exhausted of being the one to spearhead him getting mental health support in increasing levels of intervention. I am so tired of not being able to lean on him for support because he can’t support himself. I am running on fumes of managing and maintaining every other part of our life because he can only find the energy and drive to go to work, and not much else unless I do all the planning for him. 

I love this man with my whole heart, and am working so hard to try and help us build the life and family we want. But I am so afraid that we won’t get to have those things because of his continued struggle. 

I am using all my energy to teeter back and forth between withholding/walking on eggshells when he is “in a mood” and trying to set appropriate boundaries when he gets defensive and/or directs his anger and frustration at me constantly.

Small vent/thoughts needed,1,1.0,1716861399.0,"Hi all, 

this is my first reddit post.

My partner is currently in her second visit this year into a mental health hospital. when she had intake the plan was to do ECT and would start that week (last week). this has since been pushed back till this week as they wanted to have her withdrawn off the med she was currently on.

I have supported her since we have gotten together with all of her hospital visits due to her health both physical and mental. walked out of work multiple of times to make sure I was by her side and risked losing my job to make sure she was ok.

the thing I need some perspective is that my best friend who I may get a chance to catch up with once a year has a get together this weekend which we were invited to months ago when it was first announced. my partner is  not wanting me to go because she wants me to visit her every day because she is just starting ECT this week, which I do understand as the last time she was there we lived around the corner and I would visit before and after work. since then we moved about 30mins away from the facility.

I have spoken to the doctor that will be conducting the ECT  and they have explained that over the first few sessions my partner will be basically on bed rest for a few days after each session. while she is on bed rest she is not allowed to leave the grounds and visitors are not allowed into her room.

I am the only partner (from what I have been told from her and her family) that has supported and stood by her during her MH journey and I am worried that this is some sort of control from her in a sense subconscious attachment/abandonment  issue.

I feel like I'm in the wrong/guilty if I was to go visit my friend and not be there for my partner, but feel that I shouldn't have to stay at home and do nothing because I wont be able to see her. 

I'm not sure what to do or how to find a middle ground for this

Therapy made me feel worse. Is that supposed to happen?,1,1.0,1716857246.0,"I sought out therapy a little over a year ago. I went through some rough patches from 2020-2022. I started figuring my shit out on my own and made some progress. I moved states, was back to working out and eating healthy, signed up for school, and was generally making forward progress in my life. I sought out therapy in the hopes that it would help me on my new journey, but all it seemed to do was drag me down.

I never felt that my therapist understood me. 

I had some difficult reintegrating into my friend group after a few years away. They were all getting married, buying houses, having kids. I was just restarting my life after being a caregiver. I had spent so much time alone or in hospitals around terminally ill people that I felt like I had forgotten how to be positive. I had the idea that things would get better as I started doing things again. My therapist seemed to want to focus on my difficulty socializing.

I also expressed my newfound interest in science. I had signed up for some courses at the local community college and was excited to explore this area that I had long neglected. My therapist started pushing the idea that I was autistic, that I liked to hyperfixate on niche subjects, that I would fit in great with the socially awkward nerds who never liked to go out. I was a little taken aback, being that I have always been very social and able to make friends. I ""found"" science when looking for hope for the future. I found a lot of comfort in the idea that I could help look for/work on solutions for those things that we can't fix, like cancer. Being a caregiver was very difficult, in part because nothing I did was enough.

There was also a session where I talked about my feelings. Having lost my family and feeling like my friends were going in a different direction, I expressed a desire to have a social circle. My therapist asked me if I was planning on hurting myself, others, or animals. I was very shocked by his questions and it really made me question myself. I have never had those thoughts, but was I acting or thinking in a way that leads to those?

I ended up qutting therapy about a month after that session. It has taken some time to regain my confidence and start doing things again. I try to be a good person, I have good intentions and I am trying to do more good actions. It has been difficult, as therapy made me second guess myself. The farther I get from my last therapy session, the better I feel about myself and what I am doing.

Dad's behaviour changed,2,1.0,1716843422.0,"Hey everyone, I hope this is the correct place to ask for help.

My dad is 51 years old and all his live, he worked on and invested into our house which is located in a very remote area. Apart from that he doesn't have any hobbies except for a tiny bit of skiing and a bit of mountainbiking. Apart from occassional days where he was angry, he was always very supportive and took good care of the family.

  
But in the last 3-4 months, his behaviour changed drastically, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. Some interesting events include going to a club in a nearby city (about 20 mins by car) where most people of his age go to. 

Since then, he became very selfish and agressive and we can see that he is fighting some inner demons. This manifests mostly in him constantly saying that he is gonna sell the house he has worked so hard for and move to this aforementioned city. But he doesn't have any concrete plans and doesn't know what's bothering him and what he would like to have changed and the more he talk about what he will do, the more he contradicts himself. He just constantly complains about this house and the remoteness. 

There are days where we're just fighting for hours about it because he goes on and on about how he wasted his entire life in this house with us. Also, this rage and frustration (also agains us, his family) comes in phases and there are days (although they get rarer) where he is completely normal. But what shokes me most are his intense mood fluctuations. They go so far that on his good days he doesn't even remember what he said in his rage.

  
I'm almost certain that he has some kind of mental illness. But when we try to tell him that and suggest that we help him get better and that he sould visit a therapist, he just laughst and says that he is fine and he doesn't need help. It's like talking to a toddler that doesn't comprehend that you're trying to help.

I do have friends, but they all have more active lifes than me. They all have partners, more active jobs. 
And because I've been so alone and more active on my phone my anxiety has gone through the roof. I'm so much more scared and dreading of thoughts of my friends not liking me or ignoring me. 
I do know these thoughts are false. I've had validation through them that no there isn't anything wrong and that I haven't done anything, which has helped but obviously it doesn't just make anxiety dissapear.

The abuse I received from my partner did last on me. As I said it was a trauma bound, so I know it was not healthy. I feel more like myself now. I was consumed by the relationship and now I'm starting to feel more like me but I do of course miss the care and reassurance and emotional dependence of the relationship. 
So I've been trying to manage myself. I've been doing it for the past 2 months. It feels like whenever I have a problem and I solve it a new one pops up. At the start it was the brake up, than I had anxiety over my ex spreading rumors about me, I got over that, than I had another anxiety problem with a seperate person but that's mostly solved and now I'm having anxiety towards my friends. I seem to be having like small moods swings. Like today I had a anxiety attack over everything and I had thoughts of dread over my future. Now I'm fine and aren't having those thoughts/I know they are over exaggerated. 

I will be going to university, and also I do try to hang out with my friends each weekend. All of this helps and I love but the transition points where nothing is happening seems to be consuming. Like I will have massive anxiety over my friends but if I'm hanging out with them I'll be fine. 
When I'm in university I hope to see insured mental health services. I know I can see a psychiatrist there probably. 
Sorry if this was just a ramble. I just really want to have a stable mindset and positive outlook on things while I'm alone and in this transition point. I want heal my compulsions I do because of anxiety like texting people alot or trying to make sure they don't hate me when I know they dont

Getting a loved one to seek therapy ,1,1.0,1716856754.0,"Hi, I’m currently at my limit with my Father. For background info I’m (24f) who still lives at home w/o a job as I’m disabled and autistic. (I got all my gen-Ed’s done at CC but haven’t been able to transfer for multiple reasons) So I still mainly rely on my parents for my needs. My Dad was the main earner in the family, he’s had a history of depression and anxiety. It’s been little over a year since this episode of major depression and anxiety has happened. He lays in bed most of the day now only goes into work a tiny bit or none at all (owns an e-bike business). So far he’s only focused on the medication aspect which clearly isn’t enough. We’re losing money, even if he works like normal it’s definitely not enough and really should get another job. (He then claims that it would be impossible to get a better paying job before of being in his 60’s and the economy not bc of his mental health) He’s also a narcissist which doesn’t help the situation. 
It’s stressing me out that he’s pretty much non-functional, and it can’t keep going on, from the beginning I knew he needed to see a therapist (I’ve done therapy for many years and know the benefits) but he blames his insurance and lack of money for not going. I haven’t said this (I only speak to my mom about it) but if therapy gets him back to working the $ won’t matter. He can’t think only a pill can solve his problems.
I care about him and the stability of our family as this is also highly stressing out my mom too.

How Do I Let Go?,1,1.0,1716854658.0,"I suffer with a myriad of things, so I am not someone people actively want to be friends with or want to have around. It took me until I was 30 to realize this. So, I actively isolated myself, after I realized that I was trying too hard and was forcing friendship with people who didn't want it with me (I was always initiating contact, and often times people ghosted me). It hurts knowing that the vast majority of people are only interested in being friends with people they can gain things from. I have had people tell me ""you have nothing to offer"". So, for the last 3 years the isolation from this kind of trauma has been very helpful in coping with my struggles, because the shame and sadness I felt from constant rejection was too much to bare on top of my other struggles. What I want help with now is how to overcome the confusion and repeat triggers of remembering the people who have basically shamed me. I want my life back; I think about them several times a day and not by choice, but as some sort of triggered response from things that I used to associate with them. I know their favorite colors and think of them whenever I see those colors, one has a set of twins and so seeing or thinking of things in pairs makes me upset, I see their faces eerywhere because they have those kinds the kind of ""common"" faces (not unique), I think of them whenever I hear their style of music. I have tried avoidance of these things, and I have tried just letting go, and I have tried trying to take ownership of these kinds of things which those people tends to dominate in my mind (make her favorite color my own favorite color, etc.). None of these techniques for coping have worked, they have almost made it worse. I don't think of them any less. I want them to cease to exist in my memory. I have forgotten so many things about my life, and have forgotten about so many people, as well. I think I struggle to let go because I actually loved these people (one way love, obviously).

It's easier to forget my parents because they wronged me a lot, but those people I mentioned, they never really wronged me in ways other than simply not wanting me around. So, there is a lot of wonder left in my mind, and my mind goes wild on those wonders. I do not have any explaining to do, and I do not want to hear from them.

They were supportive for a month or so after my attempt but then they cut ties with me. Later on I heard from a friend who stayed friends with both them and me that they were laughing at me and calling me a creep for being too emotional after my attempt.

How to stop the spiraling thoughts,1,1.0,1716850898.0,"I’ve been in therapy for years working on healing from CPTSD and feel like I’m getting no where. I know that’s not true, but it often feels like it. As a kid I was just diagnosed with depression and treated for that. As an adult I was diagnosed additionally with generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD-PI, and CPTSD. I thought getting on the right meds would help solve my issues but it hasn’t. In fact, being aware has almost made things worse. I focus on the fact that these issues were so glaringly obvious as a kid and no one helped me. Now I’m an adult and have nothing to show for it because I’ve struggled so hard my entire life to only be “average”. 

I feel like I’m constantly working and even relaxing is work because there’s too much I need to do to be better. To make a better life for myself. I go to therapy, I read self help books, I want to continue my education for my career, and it’s all too much. That on top of just maintaining my apartment by myself and taking care of my two dogs- the only things I love in this world. 

Which brings me to my point. I’m sitting here reading a book about managing ADHD and can’t stop my thoughts from spiraling. I can’t afford to refill my meds right now which is a large reason why I’m struggling so much and I know that. I’m compensating as much as I can with coffee. But I’m just sitting here feeling like a [my age] year old failure who barely has a career because I didn’t go to school for it and am working off of being self taught, not getting paid what I feel I should for how much I do, feeling like a bother to everyone I interact with, and wanting to break up with my partner even though they are so incredibly supportive and loving to me, I just feel like I’m only going to bring them down because I feel like such a mess. 

How do you do it? How do you stop the negative thought downward spiral? How to do teach your brain that you’re worthwhile? It’s not that I want to die right now, but I don’t want to live. I don’t feel like I should or deserve to. I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone close to me because I just burden them. They already have enough to deal with, they don’t need to deal with my nearly suicidal brain. And if it got worse, I would call a help line. This wouldn’t be a first. But even then, there are others who need it too, why should I take up their place in the call queue? What if I’m unknowingly ruining someone’s life?

One problem was my Vyvanse. I started to suffer bad side effects and didn't realize it was from that med until I was put on another med recently that made it worse. I have since weened myself off.

"As a woman, I hate existing. Especially now that I know my sex is inferior in literally every way that matters.",0,0.25,1716859532.0,"Hey.

I'm not sure how to say this, but I hate being a woman. However, I'm not transgender. See, there's a very logical reason why I hate being a female. Actually, there are several reasons, but the main one I'd like to explore is intelligence. Like most people, I used to believe that, while men were undeniably stronger than women, the two sexes were equal in terms of intelligence or IQ. I lived my life believing that lie for nearly two decades. But recently that belief was shattered when I discovered several studies indicating that women had lower IQs than men. Additionally, the male variability hypothesis proves that men are always going to be the smartest people on the planet and that women will never reach the top of any field. Studies conducted by Charles Murray, J. Philippe Rushton, Richard Lynn, and others indicate one conclusion: the reason why no woman has contributed anything of significance to math, philosophy, science, art, or music stems from very low intelligence levels. Similarly, the college courses with lower IQs are all dominated by my sex.

All of these well-established scientific concepts have made me hate being a female. If we're neither intelligent nor strong, then what the hell are we good for? It seems every single positive quality went to the male gender, while all of the weaknesses and negative attributes went to us. Women have no cognitive or physical traits to embrace, and, contrary to the revisionist lies my history teachers taught me, we have no important historical accomplishments or achievements to take pride in. Ada Lovelace never actually accomplished anything; Charles Babbage did all the work. 

I hate that males are these amazing superheroes of wit, strength, speed, and intelligence, while we women are relegated to the gutter because we lack the endowments to contribute in any meaningful way. I see no reason why I should like being a woman. We're good for nothing.",mentalhealth,killme987,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d27qpo/as_a_woman_i_hate_existing_especially_now_that_i/,2

What could this mean?

I often get into this headspace where for days or weeks I'll just feel like a shell of a person. Can't shower, can't wake up at a normal time, can't eat normally (either spend all my money on only eating takeout or eat shit food like only ramen noodles for every meal, etc), can't do much at all. Sometimes, during all this, I feel like I genuinely just can't move.

Like today for an example. I've felt a bit out of it, like my body is fighting it's way out of some sort of depressive episode of just shutting down, so I'm constantly feeling in and out of this horrible, numb mood. My boyfriend was here to visit this weekend and suggested that we go for a walk to the beach to enjoy the nice weather and while we were getting ready for that, I suddenly felt like I just shut down. I was sat on the edge of my bed, fully dressed but not really ready to leave and I was thinking to myself ""you can't NOT go to the beach now. Please, just get up. You have to go to the bathroom so you can leave. Get up, get up, you need to get up and get ready, get up"" and even with my hands at my sides, I couldn't push myself off the bed, I couldn't stand up, I was just sitting there motionless feeling a pit in my stomach and so so heavy just all over. No matter how much I said to myself I wanted to get ready and go to the beach, I just had no strength to physically move myself. I started to cry and said to my boyfriend that I can't move and I'm trying so hard, apologising for not getting ready and he had to physically hold my hands and help me to my feet.

I'm never really around my boyfriend when I experience these horrible, empty moments (We don't live together, but I do talk to him about them over the phone) so it felt awful having to show it to him over this weekend. Does anyone know why this kind of thing might happen? Like laying in bed or sitting down and just not being able to move a muscle to do anything no matter how much you think you want to do that thing or how important it is? I've never had therapy (a lot of moving around, no savings, hard to get into basically) so I really don't understand my mental health much and this can lead to very frustrating and emotionally painful experiences. Is this common with depression? If so, does anyone know WHY it might be??

"Healing journey going well, except I still feel animosity towards my boyfriend’s friend groups ",1,1.0,1716845306.0,"
After years of letting childhood and teen trauma from constantly being bullied sit and affect me, I (24F) found a therapist that is helping me work through my trauma and the effects that I’ve had from it. It’s been going great considering I’ve been able to challenge my social anxiety at a healthy level by doing things such as hanging out with a girl I take Pilates from and meeting some of her friends in small doses, getting involved in my fave soccer team’s local fan club,& befriending my new coworker

However, I just feel like I’m stuck with how I feel about my boyfriend’s (25M) two main friend groups. One of them is his group that all live in our city. I don’t have an issue with the guys, but I can’t stand their girlfriends, especially because two of them still act like popular sorority mean girls. My boyfriend doesn’t see them that way, and he understands my avoidance of any social event with them now, but he wants me to get to the point where I can hang out with the full group and be a bit warmer and like myself towards the girls. However, I feel so content not having to be around them, and I haven’t changed my thoughts on them. 

He has another friend group from college that gathers a few times a year. It’s a mix of guys and girls with more girls being involved. I’m friends with one of the girls and one of the guys girlfriends, but the last gathering (it was over a whole weekend) made me feel like the other SOs that joined on the trip were more embraced than me and I felt like a lot of the group didn’t seem as interested in embracing me, some were a bit cold towards me, so I feel like a bit of an outsider. My boyfriend wants me to try again with them, but we both see the situation differently where I’m very hesitant to try again. 

I feel really upset, because I feel like I’m letting him down by not feeling any more open to being around his friend groups than I did before I started with my new therapist, especially because I’ve become so much more open with other social opportunities, and you inherit the other person’s social circles in a serious relationship.

I’m having a hard time thinking whether or not I should go to therapy,1,1.0,1716844762.0,"For context, I didn’t really have a rough childhood, but there were bad spots, mostly caused by me. I got introduced to adult videos at a pretty young age, probably as early as 5. This really affected me when I was 12 and I would have an unhealthy relationship with adult videos. Combine that with the fact my family is catholic and my aunt and uncle would in some occasions blackmailing me with what I search, it really hurted my family and myself mentally. I unfortunately still watch adult videos but I do my best to make sure to not let it affect my personal life.

I also had some problems when in the United States where I would find myself repeatedly doing the same small mistakes that my stepdad would increasingly get mad at (he was a high-ranked army enlisted). This affected me pretty bad now that I live on my own in the military because now every minor shortcoming or mistake I do is painful to me because it reflects who I am to the people in my company and their trust in me if the worst happens. 

 I never got therapy for any of these problems because I was so busy and burned out with early college and my stepdad would tell me that if I did seek help for my mental issues, I would be labeled as too unstable for military service. But, to be fair to them, I never helped myself become a better person and I hurt a lot of my family members because of mistakes I sometimes consciously made. Also, they did their best to get me away from porn and stop acting dumb, but I always keep on crashing back. This is also the reason why it’s been hard for me to finally go to therapy, because I am not sure if this is something worth getting professional health, especially when I hurt a lot of good people. It just doesn’t seem fair for me to go to therapy if I am not a victim but a person causing hurt.

I just want people’s opinion on the matter I am in and what steps I should take from here. Thank you..

I met a German girl who could hardly speak english; everyone in the group fancied her and much to my surpise I got her , I think she was the first girl I ever had real feelings for ; she was much more advanced than me and I think she was away with someone else the following week, however it was good to get a girl like that even for a few days before she buggered off.

We all had such a good time together , a bunch of unhinged youths basically  living our best lives in the comfort of a massive resort complex that gave us freedom.

I was not part of the popular  crowed bk home , I had a reputation of being a push over and was excluded ;  growing up with a poor single mum never helped,  guess the only good part of her abusive partner was an all inclusive holiday every year,  were I could do my own thing with min contact with the parents.

Happy memories, it's eating me, all the things we did, places we have been, fun we shared. Feels like a dream now.

I had a panic attack today and it really opened my eyes up.,1,1.0,1716838848.0,"If anyone has ever had a panic attack, you'll know the feeling of the 'impending doom.'  
For those who haven't, it is pretty much the feeling that you are dying and it is time to say your goodbyes, and this feeling comes over because a panic attack shares pretty much exact symptoms with a heart attack, so your mind immediately goes into panic mode and then, peacefully, into 'this is it' mode.

I was at work, and suddenly my vision started to go, my heart began pacing incredibly fast, and I was struggling to breath. Every bad thought I've ever experienced started rushing into my mind, I began reminding myself of everything I've been going through for a while; and then 2 minutes later, I entered the impending doom mode.  
I accepted that this was it, while sitting aside the wall in the corridor outside my office, I seriously thought that I was dead and that it was my time to go, when I say this somewhat brought me peace - I mean that.

But when you have that experience, it really opens up your eyes to how lucky you are. When it passed, and I was able to see, breathe, and walk fine - I got incredibly overwhelmed by how lucky I was that I was here, how there are people out there in worse situations than me and here I am, breathing.  
I thought I was going to die, and that nobody would've known I said goodbye, I was going to die in a hallway tucked away in a huge office building that nobody ever walked down, and overcoming that feeling truly opened up my eyes.

I'm telling my story because I want people to understand, as rough as it may be right now, and as painful as it may be, there is always an even bigger boulder than could drive right over you, and you **will** push that boulder off of your chest.  
I'm sat here with my eyes full because I can't even explain how grateful I am that I had a panic attack, without making this off topic, it felt like divine intervention; something horrific happening to me to allow me to become better.

I do not know if I am burned out or simply had some sort of a characteristic change in myself. What is wrong with me?,1,1.0,1716838699.0,"First of all, I need to inform you that I did not consult a therapist to diagnose my issue, and I am not asking you guys to do it. I am just here to share my (what I believe to be an) anomaly and discuss it with you. Here it goes:

I will cut it as short as possible, to not distract the attention. Nothing that my friends or family or other people tell me interests me nor sparks any kind of excitement, anger, sadness or whatsoever. I find myself sitting there with a poker face, even when I listen to them carefully. Sometimes they tell me their breakups, sometimes their familial issues, someone's death... No, absolutely nothing. It's as if I absolutely can't react to what they say, as if I am a robot. This just feels weird because I was able to give advices or participate in the conversations in an energetic manner.

I do not want to go outside, and it's not because I feel sad or melancholic. I immediately want to go home right after my uni classes end, I do not wish to spend a single second outside actually doing something. This is weird because I was, and am, really extroverted up until approximately two years ago (nothing specific happened during that time). I just find it so exhausting to spend time outside.

I do not want to meet with new people, I also find it exhausting and I see no real difference in people. I imagine this issue to be as if I already read one specific book and I know how it ends. I feel like all those 'book's are the same, well at least that's how I feel.

I find myself willing to participate in the conversations only if the contents are politics, religions, society, literature etc which can be labelled as ""two-sided 'debate's"". I am absolutely not interested when they talk about something that has no deep meaning; such as relationships, family issues, plans for the future, problems and achivements in academic stuff... I immediately get bored and I find myself trying to drop out the conversation or abstain from it.

Disclaimer: I do not plan to pursue any suicidal activity! I added the Flair as a trigger warning for anyone who might not want to deal with anything that has to do with that. 

I (M23) have been in psychological Treatment for about a year from mid 2022 to mid 2023 due to low self esteem, jealousy, depressive episodes and a rather unpleasant past from school bullying. 

The Therapy went well and after a year I felt strong enough to do a Semester abroad and not having therapy at this time. 
The Germany health insurances do not grant video call therapy, so I just „sent it“ and went to sweden for half a year. 

Not the best decision, because the swedish winters took their toll and I developed a full on Winter depression, a feeling that I was not used to before. I Had depressive Episodes but that was something different. 

I developed severe depression, mainly due to social anxiety in a unknown country and as soon as I arrived in my Hometown, I contacted my former Therapist in order to rearrange a Therapy appointment. First, he was helpful and open. I expressed that I had severe depression, anxiety and was thinking about a way out of this World, in order to regain power over myself again. He understood and agreed to help me, but insisted on a group therapy program, which i really disliked the idea of, as social anxiety was one of my triggers. He was adamant nonetheless and I gave it and gave it a try. 

Long story short: the Days before the session were made out of multiple panic attacks, after the third session I told my therapist that this was to much for me, and asked if we can return to the safe space if a private session. 

My therapist did not agree to this and basically told me, that if i dont want the group therapy, I will have to find a new therapist. 
I told him, that I wont have the energy to find a new one, finding a therapist is Germany takes at least half a year. On the other side, everything in me rages against the group treatment, to an extend that it renders me useless the rest of the week.

I feel empty when i'm not engage in a  very intense relationship,1,1.0,1716829566.0,"Hi !

First time doing a post like that. I hope i'll express myself well (english is not my first language) (: 

I just broke up  with my 9  years relationship (i'm 26). ''We need to grow apart, but we'll meet again'' type of situation. So now im back on the dating  scene. It's not totally new  cause  we  were  in  a open relationship. 

I went a date last week. It was fun, but missing a spark. And then i started to think why  do I  need a intense connexion  to see myself  pursue things  with  someone.  Im seeking this intense feeling, this spark like i know form  before so casual dating is kind of hard  for me. The overthinking  process continue  and  i  ask myself ,  is it bad ? do i limited  myself or block  potentiel relationship because of that desire of Grand Amour ? am i  just a hopeless  romantic ? 

The overthinking continue, and i realised that i feel empty when i'm not engage in a intense romance connexion. I'm wondering what is the goal ? what am i doing here? am  i trying to fill a basic need of feeling love that i lacked during my childhood/teenage years. 

I started to feel very sad, cause that feeling of emptiness became quickly overhealimg. i realised that i spend so much time focusing on love that its hard for me to  put that energy on learning new skills for exemple. 

Its also a very lonely feeling. Especially in a app dating era when my friends goes form date to other one. Its hard to explain that i need more then a casual relationship. 

Anyone relate to that ? If yes, how to overcome that feeling of emptiness ? How to believe life is worth living without a romantic relationship ? 

Also is it a bad thing to look for deep connection ? Am i closing myself form other thing ? Can i just relate on intuition and feeling when it comes to dating ?

This Only lasted a couple hours as I took my Seroquel medication as soon as I noticed that I was experiencing mania/psychosis

Even though I was psychotic and de-realised, I was aware that this may have been a very uncomfortable and unsettling experience for her to be around someone that is unsure if reality is real and experiencing psychosis.

I asked her if she felt comfortable with you sleeping in the same room as her, and she said absolutely, but I didn’t feel like I had any real way of knowing she’s actually comfortable around me when I’m like that.
We are often great communicators, however I worry that she is really concerned of upsetting me by saying that she doesn’t feel comfortable around me when I occasionally get like this, I will initiate another conversation with her soon, but I also wonder if anybody else has experienced this before?

Socialization,1,1.0,1716827747.0,"I (20M) have struggled with mental health for a while now. I remember it beginning when I was around 13-14, at the time I was just diagnosed with depression and anxiety but as the years went on I always had a feeling that it was more than that. 

Going to college this last year has shown me just how bad I’ve gotten. I didn’t make any friends. I didn’t meet any girls. I was very lonely and my mood was all over the place. I’m back home from college now and have been hanging out with an old friend. He introduced me to this girl that his girlfriend is friends with and I started to really like her. The only problem is I simply cannot socialize well with her, especially in a group setting. 

I don’t know what it is but in the moment I’ll just freeze up, my brain will be trying to come up with something, anything good to say whether I’m trying to add on to something someone else says or start a whole new topic after a lull in the conversation, but nothing will come up. I just end up sitting there not talking much and feeling awkward or like I’m killing the vibe. It’s got me really depressed right now because this opportunity has almost fallen into my lap, and I’m not good at meeting and connecting with new people so if I can’t do it here I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to do it. 

I’ve tried lots of therapy and many medications over the years too. It’s almost like I was born without the ability to socialize and connect with people, but I know that’s not true because I did it fine when I was younger and can still socialize well with people that I am super comfortable with. Lately I’ve been considering the possibility that I have a personality disorder but I just don’t know. I guess I’m just looking for some advice or words of encouragement or experiences of other people who feel the same way.

"Difficulty with ""fair play"" method with 3 adult household",1,1.0,1716818519.0,"Hello, I'm curious if anyone has ever had a similar situation if you've tried this. 2 months ago I spoke to my counselor about my mental load and she suggested I read the book ""Fair Play."" So I did and loved the idea.
For some context, I live with my husband and my disabled mother lives with us. My mom can't do much but loves doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen (sometimes she is a little psycho).
Anyways, I introduced the fair play method to my husband and he is starting to get into it. He took ""cleaning"" and ""tidying up"" off my list and I have been so much more relaxed.
However, there are quite a bit of cards we had to put off to the side because of my mom. Such as dishes and stuff.
Here's the thing about her, if I tried to include her, she would complain THE WHOLE time about my husband not doing his cards. She is the ""do it my way or don't do it (but why aren't you doing it?)"" Type person.
My husband put dishes in the dishwasher without running it because it wasn't full. We have a ""dirty/clean"" sign on our dishwasher and it was placed as dirty. I woke up the next morning to my mom cussing and complaining while redoing them. (She likes to hand clean them before putting them off the dishwasher. My husband and I rinse with scrub then put them in.) And it really urged me that he actually DID something but basically got crud for.
Does anyone have experience with this if they've done the Fair Play game with more than 2 adults, or are there any ideas to how I could resolve this more?",mentalhealth,nycahowelldraws,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d1s7y2/difficulty_with_fair_play_method_with_3_adult/,0

I finally reached out and went to therapy at 17 and I got diagnosed with autism, ADD , depression and anxiety. 

I have sort of lived in a crisis mode the past few months, I am already older then I thought I would ever be. I stopped trying to kill myself becuase I got a dog, I still want to die but I cant bring myself to do it, not when I am responsible for her. She will likely live another 10-14 years.

I stopped going to therapy at 18. I know I just was in it for about a year, but I found it so unhelpful. I had 2 different therapists and both ended up triggering me more then anything. They asked me a lot of quiestions like ""if you want to die then why do you come here?"". I know they have a point, it is dumb to go to therapy if you really just want to die. But it just motivatated me to attemt to kill myself. Eventually my therapist gave up on me, he said that he couldnt help me and that I just keep getting worse. And he was right, I was just getting worse. I didnt get a new therapist after that, they just sort of let me go. 

Getting placed in the psych ward was also highly unhelpful. I wasnt allowed to go outside at all and I sheard room with 5 other people. I had relaly mad sensory issues due to the lighting in the room and I wasnt allowed to keep my teddy bear with me.

I try to reflect and compare to myself as a child. I remember vividly for years as a young kid I saw a dead animal on the roadway. I tried to comprehend what *actually* happened to a body when it was hit and run over by a car. I couldn’t envision it. 

**I just didn’t understand how a living, breathing, fully embodied raccoon - could become a dry, flat, hot, plate of matter on the roadway.**  I tried to envision the process over and over. For years. Each year my understanding developed. 

Like an animation student, my rendering got better and better. I went from from basic rudimentary choppy cartoon, to a full HD second by second high fidelity, high resolution  movie. 

Over maybe 4 years I quietly pondered this to myself. I never felt grossed out, or horrified, or squeamish. It was sterile and scientific. **A study of physics and biology.**

When I learned what guns were, and then that people could actually shoot each other - wow, that was another thing to **slowly integrate into my understanding.** Again for bombs. Burning to death. Jumping from buildings (what is the impact like, what HAPPENS to the body)? 

Now this ^ and a present day genocide of real people are clearly incredibly different. 

But that’s my earliest memory and takes up a great chunk of my childhood timeline… considering **“how does physics actually play out on bodies?”**

So with that in mind: 

**Maybe I am just like this.**

**Or maybe I have become apathetic from the sheer amount of information I consume** and is forced into my brain at all times.

Hi everyone,

I'm currently in the midst of a personal crisis, and I could really use some guidance on how to navigate through it. I'm a 21-year-old college student who has been struggling with intense feelings for someone I can't have. Despite my best efforts to move on, I find myself consumed by thoughts of her, especially on occasions like her recent birthday.

Our friendship started innocently enough, but things became complicated when I discovered she had a boyfriend. Despite this, I couldn't suppress my feelings and ended up confessing to her. Her vague response left me feeling rejected and confused, and I eventually decided to cut off contact for my own well-being.

However, even after a year of no communication, seeing her photos still triggers a deep sense of inadequacy and longing within me. I've set ambitious goals for myself, hoping that achieving them will somehow make me worthy of her affection. But I know that relying on her as a source of motivation is unhealthy, and I'm struggling to find a balance.

How can I overcome these feelings of inadequacy and obsession? How do I focus on my own growth and well-being without fixating on someone who may never reciprocate my feelings?

Intense Jealousy and Obsession,1,1.0,1716802180.0,"I've always had an obsessive personality (part of me wonders if it's undiagnosed autism), and I have long-term depression which I've been taking anti-depressants for about 6 years now. I go through phases of hyper-fixating on celebrities, which becomes uncontrollable and makes me equal parts miserable and delirious and makes me feel like I have a purpose. It's really strange and embarrassing and intense and I never know how to deal with it or approach my interests in a healthy way. An example from a long time ago was that I really loved James Mcavoy, and he lived near my cousins. I had a whole plan to go to his house with a nosebleed and ask to use a phone so he would let me inside and be my friend. Then my friend pointed out that was literal stalking and I felt like I'd been hit in the head with a hammer. That's so creepy!!! Then in lockdown I had an obsession with another actor, and I wanted to know everything. What does he eat, where does he live, what music does he listen to, what does he read, where is he right now? It's so so creepy and I know I'd never actually follow or hurt anyone but my brain is a total fucking psycho and I can't figure out how to control it.

  
My recent obsession has been an actor around my age, who is cool and successful and everything I wish I was. I've been trying hard not to think about them and compare myself, but my brain just won't stop. I have dreams I'm their friend and get to be successful and cool too, but wake up in my loser bedroom in the middle of nowhere, too insecure to do anything with my time. I get annoyed that I never pursued acting when I really wanted to, and that I've wasted my last 4 years doing the bare minimum. 

  
I read and write and paint and work but nothing seems to stop my brain. I have a counsellor I speak to regularly, and this is probably the only thing I haven't admitted fully about because I'm so ashamed of myself. I've gone weeks and weeks without thinking about this actor at all, then someone mentions a show they're in and my brain starts to tailspin.

i have had a very up and down year, some environmental factors but i believe that honestly the environmental factors were caused by my mental health. 

anyways, my psychiatrist currently has me on 10mg lexapro, 15 mg 2x a day adderall, 300mg wellbutrin, and buspar. im starting the buspar very slowly at 5 mg once a day then 5 mg twice a day then full dose of 10 mg twice a day. 
it seems the buspar is supposed to help me come off the lexapro because if it works well in the next few weeks i’m supposed to cut my lexapro to 5 mg. 

i was wondering if anyone has had any experience with this combination or situation.

 i feel like i experience emotional blunting but i also don’t know if that’s what it is and im just trying to put a term on something. the best way i could describe it is i know im happy but i can’t feel the happy. i know im sad but i can’t feel it. i know im in love with my partner but there’s not much feeling behind it right now (this is a big problem for me and anxiety inducing-im having bad relationship anxiety so going through the problems of not being able to feel many emotions isn’t helping). i just feel like any emotions ive had recently have been crankiness and numbness and some anxiety. 

i will say some of it feels like it’s helpful-starting adderall made me feel like i could organize my thoughts more clearly which helps me spiral less. but overall i just kind of numb and very tired all the time. not full on zombie mode but more like a brick wall of a person. 

please don’t say some off the wall shit about “maybe it’s your relationship, maybe it’s your life” because 1. i discuss that with my therapist 2. super susceptible to others opinions and views about me causing me personal negativity. i’m really just here to see if anyone has had similar experiences. i’m fully considering slowly weaning off almost all of my medication with the advice of a doctor because i would rather feel a range of emotions than one or two or none. 

googling and posting on here is probably not helpful but i can’t stop obsessing over this “not feeling right” and im so desperate for some sort of relief. ",mentalhealth,Sea_Engineering4859,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d1hp2h/im_on_4_psych_meds_right_nowwondering_if_anyone/,4

Her condition became more worse at the month of April where she told me here daily schedule was like she sleeps at 6 in the morning and wakes up at 9am and starts to get ready for college and whenever she feels like she is going to have an episode of panic attack which is around late afternoon she goes back home and either she sleeps or passes out due to her panic attack and she again wakes up around 9 in the night and she eats and again has panic attacks till 6 in the morning. She tells me that she has 2-5 episodes that last from 45min to 2 hrs. She is on medication but she doesn’t take it regularly as she thinks she will become dependent on them for the rest of her life. There is no one particular reason for her condition, she has a lot going in her life as both her parents are sick and her mom is delaying her treatment because she wouldn’t be able to take care for her dad when she goes to surgery. Apart from that there were 3 instances of harassment which that happened sometime during the last 6 months which she only told me recently. I asked her why didn’t she tell me this earlier she told me that she couldn’t get it out of herself. There was also one Instance where she attempted suicide but then she told me she changed her mind. She has become extremely volatile with her emotions and she just spews hate when I try to help her. Her parents are currently living with her and she is hiding her condition from them as she doesn’t want to be a burden for them.

How to rebuild self esteem after a business failure.,2,1.0,1716774655.0,"Hey everyone. 31m from Australia. I hope you can give me some tips. I will layout some context as briefly as I can.

In 2020 I started my own business in the building industry as has been my lifelong dream. I was full of confidence, exuberance and for the most part, enjoyed the first 18 months of the journey.

Fast forward to 2023, after having our first daughter in 2022, my wife and I had a couple of miscarriages in very close succession, both at around 12 weeks. my wife ended up very ill and I had to take lots of time away from my business to care for my wife and daughter. 

This put me very far behind on work and financially. For the following few months, I began to fall into a serious depression myself. I began avoiding calls from customers, fell behind on bills and the spiral began. I began using opiate painkillers to ease the depression so I could continue working. By December 2023, I had made the decision to wind up my business. I had failed. 

I immediately began working for an extremely supportive employer with a great team of guys in the construction industry, all who have been through there own battles. I am still taking stock of my debts. It financially ruined us. 

I still experience severe depression and anxiety. I have an opiate addiction for which I am beginning treatment. 

The worst part is, I can't seem to experience any sort of positive self esteem. I have no hopes and dreams. I hold an enormous amount of shame over myself, as I always have, but now, I can't even hide it or pretend. I am a broken man, and all I want is to be able to show up for my wife and daughter as a good husband should.

Is there such a thing as a subconscious hybristophile?,1,1.0,1716786456.0, I've heard that hybristophiles are attracted to people who commit crimes.

But I am also attracted to men who have a specific energy. These are the only type of men that I ever want to have heterosexual relationships with in the receptive traditional perspective for a woman. I didn't know for a long time that the energy that I like in these men. May be tied to violence. But recently I found out because someone who has a faint energy I've worked with ppl who associate it with violence with his energy. My mother claimed he was in prison and killed a lot of people. And another person that I work with claimed he had a dangerous energy. And found out he was in the military and killed a lot of people. Generally I am attracted to men with even more intense energy than that. My reaction to this energy. When it's on an extreme level is fear but I convert it to sexual arousal. In the receptive sense. Looking back on men I've been involved with. They all have that same intense energy. Much more than the guy work with who's an old man. The younger attractive guys I've been with that have this energy. Would have violent tendencies. But no known crimes if they ever did. And that definitely wouldn't turn me on.

The weirdest thing is that whenever the others said anything in those “dreams” I did not understand a word. That’s why I was always saying “what”. Except out loud. 
Another example is, when my friend asks me to hand her her book , I reach for her hand in the dream and end up going straight through it. I feel my actual hand move aswell. 
The craziest thing is not that I do this at all, but that those “dreams” feel so scarily real and make me physically move. I mean imagine if you walked in on someone trying to sleep and you’re greeted with them yelling WHAT and having their arms raised in the air.

When I would ask her about what put her in that state, she would tell me that it was the sentence I said. The thing is, she would tell me I said things that I never did, or she would modify the actual sentence. An exemple of that is I told her I was giving myself some love with a little laugh because I was laying down holding my own hand, and she heard ""I'm giving myself some love... Because you won't do it"" in an accusing tone. Sometimes, when we're laying down in silence, she will suddenly ask me to repeat what I supposedly just said. Sometimes while we're communicating about something, she will suddenly ask me if I just insulted her. Everytime I try to tell her that I didn't say that and tell her what I actually said, she always answer with ""Oh so now you're switching up"" or ""stop messing with my reality!"" I've managed to have one good conversation about it with her, but it seems like she forgot about it. She also have a lot of memory issues, she forgets about things a lot which does not help.

I don't know how to approach the issue anymore, I try to be supportive and understanding. I'm always apologizing for things while telling what I actually said and what tone I used.

Im taking clomipramine 50mg which is low dose and it has helped for anxiety but i have started to realize clomipramine or any other med cant fix one issue which is almost biggest issue. That is loss of identity/identity crisis. I seriously dont know what to do in my life because i have no idea who i was last year summer or who i am now. I dont know can i get relief of this ever.

So last year summer i started brintellix and i used it two days then stopped for 6 days and then returned to brintellix. Within same first month i missed 2-3 doses two times but i am not worried about those. I am mostly worried about that missed 6 days only after two day use and temporary emotional bluntness which started about two weeks later i returned to brintellix after 6 days. That emotional bluntness lasted few weeks but it went away. So those two things has caused severe worries and fears about that my personality changed permanently because of missing doses and because of temporary emotional bluntness.

Which is severe thing is that time has passed from last year summer and i dont remember mental presice myself from last year summer before brintellix and now i dont know what to do because meds dont help for that😞 My life has been based on the fact that I feel myself but now I have no idea if I am the same person as before I started brintellix last summer and who I am at the moment. This idenitity crisis has literally ruined and maked my life pointless. So has anybody experienced something like this? Are there options left?

My problem is though, as soon as I sit on that couch it’s like I forget everything I’ve been struggling with. I can sometimes name symptoms I’ve been having, but when my therapist asks me for specifics I just can’t think and it almost feels like I’m lying even though I know I’m not. I feel like my inability to think of the major things that are going on also cause our sessions to be focused on little things that aren’t as big to me, just whatever I could think of when she asks how I’ve been feeling. I also find it hard to express just how bad things are, for example I’ll find myself saying something like “I’ve been a little anxious” when in reality my anxiety has been debilitating and I’ve been having panic attacks left and right. The morning before my last session I had one of the worse panic attacks of my life but I didn’t even mention it during our session! One of my biggest issues lately has been disassociation and I feel like that is definitely contributing to this, how am I supposed to name what’s going on when I don’t even feel like I’m real most of the time?

I did start medication before when I was 16, I'm now 26, but I came off it after being hospitalized. I feel like it helped a bit, but never enough to keep taking it. And at that time I had a rough home life, moved out and lived in my car before finding a safe place to live. So I never went back on it because I pushed through what I was feeling and  life became way too busy. But the last few years have been a real struggle to live. Everything is becoming just too much, I'm exhausted all the time, feel everything and nothing, and I'm kinda done. I've tried the breathing exercises, and eating better, sleep schedules, exercise, blah blah blah. But I just don't have the energy or capability of doing all that and working a full time job. 


I'm starting meds on the 10th, but I'm scared. I never wanted to rely on the medication to survive myself. I wanted to be more than my mental illnesses, and I feel like a failure for needing to be medicated to be alive. I'm terrified once I start that I'll never be able to come off it.

My groin and legs actually hurt physically afterwards, maybe because my body wasn’t aroused enough. The negative emotions I have surrounding this are just too powerful and they won’t leave my head. I feel vile, gross, evil, and disgusting, disgusting a million times over. I don’t know how to describe this feeling in words. It’s like a unique emotion I only get after doing anything sexual.

I have things to do, but I feel so overwhelmed, I don’t know if I can do them. It all feels like too much. All of this is making me feel terrible because I was just talking with my psychiatrist about weaning off my meds. I want to be off them because of emotional blunting, but if my emotions weren’t blunted for this, how bad would I have gotten? I also hate that it’s killed my sex drive. I hate everything sexual, but at the same time I want my sex drive back, probably because I’m some kind of perverted freak.

How did you/How do I overcome a super pessimistic mindset,5,1.0,1717087108.0,"I've been trying to shake this habit that I (M20) have had ever since I was really young where I have a terrible victim mindset.
It started with me discovering what ""luck"" is as a kid, and realizing that any inconvenience in my life can be attributed to having bad luck. Deep down, I understand its mindset over most things, or everything, but it feels like a constant fly in the back of my head that tells me any minor inconvenience I have is unlucky and there's nothing I can do about it. For example, if something bad happens I'll tell myself ""Of course that would happen to me"" and it leads me to believe I genuinely have the most difficult life out of everyone I know (This is probably not the case). Ill even try to predict how people will act or events that will happen based on what would be the most unfortunate circumstance for me, which further ties into believing the people around me are out to get me.

I was diagnosed with adhd at 18, and the meds tend to help my ability to stay focused on a task and improve my efficiency, but verbal/written instructions make no sense unless repeated multiple times or slowly as I'm doing the task.

I dislike being attracted to women,1,0.55,1717001493.0,"I'm 18 years old and a virgin.

I feel like it's an inconvenience for me to be attracted to women. I see women as women, not quite as people, and it drives me mad. I also feel... shame? Or disgust? Something along those lines but to a small degree.

When I talk to a woman, I talk differently. When I walk with a woman, I walk differently. When I'm anything with a woman that I'm attracted to, I'm just different. Like I'm trying to see if our relationship can deepen so we're bf and gf, and so I can access their pants. Subconsciously. And even if I acknowledge me acting differently consciously in the moment, its not like I can stop. 

Whoever is with me is still an attractive woman. I don't even want it to lead anywhere. I don't have what it takes right now for a girlfriend. And although I'm against being attracted to a woman for the most part, it's not like I don't want love. A relationship with someone I truly care about romantically would be the best. And expressing that love in bedy bed is great as well I'm sure. But I want an off switch for my sex drive.

Even if I.... satisfy myself, the itch is still there. And unlike normal itches, it only grows stronger the longer I leave it. And the clarity afterwards doesn't help nothing. Okay, so what if I sleep with someone? I already know that won't help anything, and I also know it won't be as ""magical"" as I think it will be. The way that stuff is depicted in.... VIDEOS isn't realistic. 

I don't WANT to talk differently when I'm with someone beautiful who just so happens to be female, I just want to talk. I'm no damn white knight, I just want a real tried and true solution to this. Please, just give me anything. (Sorry for a mess of a post.)

Horrible memory is affecting my life ,5,1.0,1716929289.0,"18 M, I’ve always had a poor short term memory but I feel that over the last couple of years it’s been declining more and more and it’s affecting my day to day life. 

For example, I can’t remember instructions correctly. If I’m told to do 3 sets of instructions I can only remember the last one given to me. This really hurt me at a uni interview I had where I was asked to solve a verbal maths problem and I felt like a complete idiot when all the instructions given to me got completely muddled in my head, so much so that I couldn’t complete it and I was sent a rejection letter… yet I knew the subject well and I should’ve been able to solve it. 

I feel like I can no longer learn, even when I write notes, really try to listen it doesn’t retain. It’s not that I can’t focus, it just feels like my brain filters all the information out. I make mistakes repeatedly because I forget about how I solved it the previous time. It doesn’t matter if it’s verbal, or if I read the information it just doesn’t go in. When I read books I can’t tell you what it was about, my brain reads the individual words but can’t form the sentence in my head. I don’t remember what people look like and it causes embarrassing situations where I’m introducing myself to people I already know, repeatedly. When I try to solve maths problems, I’ll start working it out and then forget my thought process but keep writing because I know what to do but I almost don’t know why I’m doing it. 

I was a high achieving child but over the past 5 years my memory has been making me feel like more and more of an idiot. I dropped out of college, I tried to get into uni… it was supposed to be my time to do something with my life but I messed that up to.

I actually have two different questions but both are kinda similar

1.  In my head I can’t accept my age. I am 19. But whenever like a form or someone asks my age I have to think really hard about it because every time my brain immediately jumps to I’m still 17. I do feel as though I have had my childhood and most of my life striped from me. When I was kid my family became homeless and I had to watch my little brother and make sure we always had somewhere safe to go. Once it was all over I feel as though my parents were never the same again. Which I get but like not even similar to the parents I had. I feel as though these people are just strangers now. Skip ahead a few years I was raped. The police never did anything about it and my dad screamed at me for having sex. Then my friend who helped me through that all died from fentanyl. Skip ahead a couple more years and now I’m 18 having my daughter. I guess what I’m trying to ask is is that something normal? Do I need to seek help? 

2. Last month my little sister passed away. My beloved little sister. Her boyfriend had shot and killed her. I attended her funeral. I swear the entire time I kept seeing her move. I thought I had saw her breathing. A slight smile at one point. But anytime I think about it I just think she’s still in the hospital. Just taking her time recovering but she’s not. She’s gone.

I suffered a psychosis and wanna tell my story.,7,0.9,1716891182.0,"Last summer (2023), I hosted a 4th of July party at my apartment and invited all of my friends. I was recently getting into smoking weed in an attempt to self medicate for my ADHD and mental health problems. One of my friends (we’ll call him John) that I invited over has been a stoner since high school so I trusted him on advice about weed. I had only smoked a few times prior to this night and I had overdone it most every time and freaked out a little bit, so needless to say my tolerance to THC was very low. That night we decided to try some sour rope edibles. Each gummy was like 300 mg so John decided to cut it in half and eat his half and me and someone else split our half so we each ended up with about 75 mg. John had a really high tolerance and I guess didn’t realize that I wouldn’t and told me that it would be perfectly fine. Fast forward about an hour when the edible started to kick in, it came in waves and the first one wasn’t so bad, it felt nice actually even though it hit suddenly like a slap in the face. The second wave was a little stronger and more sudden and had a little anxiety. Then the third wave hit my like a damn semi truck. All of a sudden I’m jumping up from our table like “nope can’t do this” and run inside in a full blown panic attack freaking out. As a few minutes goes by it only gets worse until my fiancé takes me to our bedroom with a bottle of water and sits me on the bed while I’m freaking the hell out. Not only did I think I was dying that night, but I was having an out of body experienced witnessing myself and my fiance sitting on the bed from a Birds Eye view. I don’t remember anything else about that night other than I was knocked on my ass by that edible and lost my absolute shit to say the least. Anyways I just remember waking up the next morning and feeling fine and I called my friends and told them I was okay. Then a few days later I felt the feeling creeping back. It started out slowly with a panic attack or two and by the end of the week I was locked in a non functional psychosis. I was convinced I had rabies, brain tumors, etc. I was completely delusional about anything and everything it was like my life was a constant panic attack 24/7. I couldn’t sleep and when I did I would wake up freezing and shaking violently after only an hour or so. I went to the ER probably 4-5 times that summer just because I was freaking the hell out. I even admitted myself to a psych ward for a few days. I was so dissociated 100% of the time that I would just be doing random things and not realize it. I had to quit my job because I was completely non functional. This lasted for about 3 months before it got any better and then after that i started slowly gradually recovering. To this day, almost a year later I’m not fully recovered but I make progress every day and I feel almost back to normal, though it was a terribly traumatic experience and the hardest part of my life to date.

I'm concerned about a friend of mine who is increasingly delusional. I've known him for years, and over the past few, his mental state has been deteriorating. He opened up to me the other day and what he had to say was very concerning.  He has deep apophenia, to the point where he’s legally changed his name based on his delusions.

I tried to speak to the only family member I know he has, and they wouldn’t take my call. So I wrote them a detailed message but they brushed off my concerns, saying that he's fine. This doesn't sit right with me, as I see him getting worse and I'm worried for his safety and well-being.

I live on the other side of the country and I'm too broke to help him in person. I'm looking for advice on how to support him from afar. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

What's weird its only eating while drinking, hygiene, etc are all pretty normal but i don't know why with food i always get too lazy to do eat unless it's something special i'm looking forward to like having dinner with my husband or lunch with friends or cooking/baking something i always wanted to try but i can't do that every day, so how do i fix my eating routine, i'm starting to get fatigued and i can sort off see my ribs (last i check i was 46-52 kgs and i'm 183cm, lowest was 42 kgs), my husband is getting concerned so i gotta find a quick fix. 

I have ASPD, depression, and PTSD, all diagnosed. I doubt ASPD effects my eating routine and my depression/PTSD always manifests as short temperament, drinking, smoking, and/or horrible mood swings. I know i always had procrastination problems since middle school, but it was always about school work not eating. I thought maybe it was stress, after all i work and go to uni but this happens even when i'm relaxed and happy. I have no history with ANY EDs as well and no self confidence issues especially with my weight. I have no issue with food except normal stuff like low blood sugar, low iron, lactose intolerant, and other allergies besides that i'll eat anything, i've eaten bugs, balut, goats head, i like cooking and baking, i can always buy food  so not like i'm short in money or choices here. Just i don't have the urge to eat, i wanna stay in bed longer or keep drawing or maybe just finishing this mission in a game i like, it's such a petty reason.

Looking for a job, saving up for rent in the Fall, driving lessons with my dad (I'm licensed but unexperienced to the point where my folks aren't willing to let me take the car off to my uni without substantially more practiced, and I've also had 2 severe episodes of panic while at the wheel), even ""fun"" things: hanging out with my friends or my sister, playing D&D, playing video games with friends or solo, reading books, writing/creative stuff. EVERYTHING is just too much for me right now, it all takes from a reserve of energy that feels like it's been empty for months. Maybe it's just post-finals burnout, idk... But i feel like this has been building for a while, years even, just getting worse and worse.

I used to be able to spend hours of my days on creative projects, then hang out with friends, on top of classes, and feel completely fulfilled.

It becomes a self fulfilling loop, a spiral down and down and down, forever.

As this has been building Ive been pondering how to fix it, how to find fulfillment and the energy for activities again, but up until now that search for a solution has just been another fruitless worry on my plate siphoning my energy away.

Finally taking steps to improve my life,1,1.0,1716767446.0,"So, for starters, I am using a throwaway because I was hesitant to post this, but I also hope that this story could maybe help someone.

A few years ago I went into a really depressive state and I didn't really take care of myself. It lasted for a few months and when I finally felt a little better and started take care of myself, I could not fix my depression bun. I was to scared to ask for help, but it wasn't that noticeable nor was it uncomfortable so I left it. Which I would not recommend doing.

Fastfoward to today, it is definitely more noticeable and uncomfortable. I have decided to finally just cut it out. I have always wanted short hair, which thinking back could have part of my problem of not wanting to care for my hair, so it isn't that big of a deal. I am going to try to avoid doing a buzz cut as I want some hair, which may be possible to avoid as there is a lot of free hair under the actual bun.

I will be doing this in a few hours and I am both excited and nervous. I am happy that I will have a peice of myself back and not be as restricted to what I can do (since some stuff requires specific hairstyles), but I am still nervous because what of something goes wrong or it looks bad. I will update with what happened and what is was like after cutting it. 

Update: So I did cut my hair last night and there was quite a bit of hair I was able to save! I had enough left to get one of my dream haircuts! Also washing it felt heavenly. I was super nervous while doing so, but I am super glad I did it!

Thanks for reading this and have a wonderful day/night!

She’s 3 now and a golden retriever, she’s always been timid. However I’ve noticed her developing anxiety herself… car rides, thunderstorms, anything unfamiliar can scare her too. It’s gotten pretty bad. But the thing that affects us the most, is my daily mood. If I’m depressed or angry or anxious she gets like… tip-toe-y around me. If i yell at a game on my phone she gets anxious. She runs from me. She squishes her little face like she ate a lemon. I’m like 90% sure it’s her anxious face…

Effect of Overly Strict Parents on me,1,1.0,1716771443.0,"Alright so I’m 23 and just graduated college. It’s been difficult to find a job so I’m most likely going to have to go back home and live with my parents for a few years while I build up some money and I’m kind of dreading it. For some background, my parents have been very strict my entire life. I am a 1st born child. My dad was my middle school principal. As a teenager, they wouldn’t let me have my phone in my room by myself. I would have to leave it in the living room when I would go to my room. I would constantly be grounded. I felt I had to be perfect in school because all the teachers knew me because of my dad. That’s just a few examples of the strictness. To this day, my mom treats me like a child and checks my location on Find My IPhone constantly and many other things. I believe this has had many effects on me. I became rebellious in high school and even more in college when I finally felt the freedom. I became addicted to weed and gambling (mostly my own fault) & have always dealt with anxiety and depression issues. I have always been very socially anxious, sometimes socially awkward, introvert, paranoid I’m gonna get in trouble for little things, and hard to connect with people socially sometimes even though I have many friends. I don’t know if my parents strictness had any effect on this that’s why I’m posting on here. I have also always been a very good liar and sneaky. One time I told my mom “strict parents make sneaky kids” and it made her think a little bit. I wanted to get some thoughts on this & how I can possibly fix these things moving forward. I love my parents but I fear they have had more of a negative impact on me than positive. Sorry for the long post.

I need some advice…,1,1.0,1716771277.0,"So, some context for yas.
I’ve been living with my parents since graduation(I think 2022?) and it’s been taking a toll on my mental health. I’ve started a job, and haven’t gotten enough hours to satisfy my parent. We sometimes get in a squabble about how little hours I get, so they came upon a decision for me to find another job, which I agree with. On the other hand, the job I’m at is killing me. It’s only retail at a dispensary, though I feel as if I do most of the work while others sit in the back. I do my best. I get home and am in incredible pain from standing all day, yet I go in the next shift with a smile. 

Some weeks I get a few days off in a row. Lately I’ve been getting called in to cover some people. I like to work because I feel like I have a purpose. Though, like I said, I’m dead by the end of my shift. Anyway.. when I get called in, it’s usually at an inconvenient time. Me being a bigger guy, I like to be prepared beforehand. Often times that isn’t the case, yet my parent makes me go in anyway. Dead, unprepared, and weak from being a bigger guy standing all day. 

I’m stuck in this constant cycle of whether or not to cash in my ticket because of the endless loop of feeling like I don’t have any choice in life. Still living at home, and still depressed. 
I know this isn’t much context. There’s much more to this than I explain, though it sums it up.

I beg for advice, and I thank you in advance for the help.
Have a good day dear friends.

Meeting new people on vacation has made me feel more at ease with myself as a person,1,1.0,1716771273.0,"
I’ve always felt like a loner in my hometown. People can be judgemental here and I felt like I had to act like someone I’m not to fit in. Most friends were only there for the ‘mask’ I put on, and we didn’t really vibe. I’ve never had a relationship either because I had closed off too much of myself emotionally. I always felt like nobody would ever really be close to me. 

In the past few years I’ve been travelling, mostly party vacations with a couple of my friends who ‘get me’ better. I came back from one a few weeks ago. And man, I loved it. Just going out with my friends, goofing around like total idiots, meeting all kinds of new people who also were up for just acting like idiots, I always return home after and feel like I’ve had a blast. 

I realised you can meet more people who you hit it off with anywhere. I’ve met great people who I instantly vibe with any time I travel, and it always acts as a reminder that you’re not alone. When I came back from that trip a few weeks ago I cried from happiness. Something just finally clicked in my brain. I’m not hopeless, there’s not something wrong with me as a person, and I’m not doomed to be lonely. It sounds silly learning these lessons from party vacations with friends, but it’s been so big me. I feel more confident and at peace with myself. I always knew rationally that if people judge you then that’s on them, but it’s like it took throwing myself out there to make it click emotionally in me. Now it has and I feel so at peace.

Struggling with childhood memory,1,1.0,1716767976.0,"For the last month I've been ruminating thoughts around a memory of an event from 20+ years ago. When I was 11, I accidentally hurt our cat and it lead to him dying. It was an extremely stressful, anxious time in my life and I couldn't understand what I was feeling or why. I let out my aggression and stress on our cat and immediately felt terrible, sorry and scared. I never told anyone about it, and my family assumed he had an accident that lead to him passing. I felt terrible for a really long time. I processed the event when I got older, made peace with the fact I was a confused child who couldn't handle my emotions and didn't mean what I did. I apologized to the memory of our cat, apologized to myself for being so hard and negative to myself about it, and eventually forgave myself and moved on.  

  

I love animals, cats especially, and have always been a kind compassionate person. My family had more cats throughout the rest of my childhood and adulthood that I loved, and I have two cats of my own now that I cherish.

  

I haven't really thought about it in years but now I can't shake the guilt and shame of it. I can't relax, I feel extreme guilt anytime I'm happy, think of something happy, or want to be happy.

I possibly left the love of my life on read,1,1.0,1716766831.0,"I (M20) never really told anybody about this but I will try to make it as straightforward as possible. This is probably too petty for this sub but I just felt like venting about this.

I never considered myself very attractive, so I never really engaged in flirting too much. That's why I never  messaged the people I was attracted to or had an insane crush on, which is essentially happened in Math class to me with a girl that we can call Bella.

Then basically, I was studying for my A-levels with another girl, let's call her Emma, that I wasn't super attracted to and eventually I asked her to go to prom. I thought she deserved to have someone go to prom with, since she also had a lot of personal issues, and I thought she would soften up to me eventually.

We had a great night on prom, I drove her home and I noticed I had a new message on my phone. Its main content basically read ""I don't expect an answer but I had a crush on you"" but I think she wanted me to respond of course.

So after I suffered a mental heart attack at 3 am, I just ignored the message because I felt like betraying Emma the second I would answer. And I dated Emma for 2 months from that point on but there never was any chemistry at all. I felt like I was just her psychologist. I thought her mental health could collapse any second. She became obsessed other peoples' expectations and at this point I ended it because she was making huge concessions at the expense of our relationship.

Then after we broke up, I had a depressive episode and neglected college and work. I became the worst version of myself. I don't think I am able to enjoy life like this, although I am starting to question whether that was ever actually the case. I can't remember that being the case. About 11 months have passed since.

Do I have BPD? I think I have BPD and it is being mistaken as OCD.,1,1.0,1716762836.0,"Mental health is something I’ve struggled with for my whole life. In particular, I’ve always been a very obsessive person. That is in the sense that I get easily attached to certain people and things; as well as constantly replaying conversations and situations that happened in my mind. I also struggled with intrusive thoughts for many years, but now that I amore matured i am able to understand that they are just thoughts. I am in a constant state of paranoia, and I always fear and feel that others are out to get me or plan on abandoning me. I also fear that despite the fact I am told by many I am a good person, that they are lying and they all actually hate me. When I am in a romantic relationship, or even if I am just talking to someone, I become entirely obsessed with them and only think about them 24 hours a day. I panic that they are not interested in me and are only pretending to be because they feel bad. And when I was a child, I used to have severe separation anxiety from my parents which still comes and goes in phases. 

Now, I am not denying that I have OCD. I’ve been diagnosed with it. I am fully aware that I suffer from intrusive and obsessive thoughts. The only difference is I do not have many compulsions. The only compulsion I suffer from is the need to confess my thoughts and feelings constantly. But I feel like my obsessive thoughts are primarily about individuals and interests that I have. Even if I become obsessed with a tv show, I can only watch that tv show and I will continue to rewatch it over and over again until I find a new hyperfixation. 

A friend of mine knows someone with BPD and she told me that a lot of the ways I get obsessed are similar to them. I am curious as to whether or not these things that I feel are still symptoms of OCD, or if BPD is possible.

I'm looking around my room right now and nothing is real it's all junk 😞 

I'm not asking for support but I just want someone to read this and know who I am and I exist idk if that's weird but that's just the truth people look at me and wonder why my eyes are so dark and sad but they just assume I'm mentally ill no one ever asked themselves why am I like this they never want to see the cause they only see the effects",mentalhealth,WaveSecure6516,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d1ca3t/ilife_experiences_do_not_read_if_your_triggered/,0

Something similar happened with two other cousins (I live with them too) but when I was a teen and at different times. I feel uncomfortable around them and don't talk to any of them.

The only person who knows is my aunt and she brushed it off making me doubt it even more. I hate how everyone trusts them and for their sisters, they're the best brothers. But I honestly have no idea if I should even tell someone because all of this still sounds so petty to me.

Crying tears of joy,1,1.0,1716731014.0,"The last four months were awful. The first month I spent struggling to get out of bed, wanting to die and trying to cut my friends off. The next couple of months I forced myself to function, but barely felt any emotions, except occasionally negative ones. I had no interest in anything and the only reason I could bring myself to do uni stuff in spite of how pointless it felt was because lying in bed felt just as pointless. A month ago I started losing all interest in social contact and even had times when the idea of spending time with people triggered uncontrollable panic. And then... it stopped.

I don't know what happened. I guess the whole time I was trying to do things that might just help and trying to keep going. Maybe eventually it finally paid off. But it's been one and a half weeks and I feel so much better than I have in a long time. I can feel joy again. I want to read for fun. I am super motivated for uni and can even face imagining a future again, something I'd given up on before. I just cried tears of joy because I have amazing friends and am just so lucky.

Yes, I have questions. Yes, I am a little worried that what happened before could happen again now because even though it feels like there can't really have been anything wrong if it got better like this, I documented things that prove it wasn't all in my head. I have doubts and concerns. But I am happy again and I think I am healing.

Girlfriend hears me say things I never said,3,0.81,1716758096.0,"My girlfriend has been struggling with mental health for a long time, but recently it feels like things got different. She has always expressed anger as a defense mechanism, but recently I noticed that she started getting angry more often and at things that didn't really seem to make sense to me. When I would ask her about what put her in that state, she would tell me that it was the sentence I said. The thing is, she would tell me I said things that I never did, or she would modify the actual sentence. An exemple of that is I told her I was giving myself some love with a little laugh because I was laying down holding my own hand, and she heard ""I'm giving myself some love... Because you won't do it"" in an accusing tone. Sometimes, when we're laying down in silence, she will suddenly ask me to repeat what I supposedly just said. Sometimes while we're communicating about something, she will suddenly ask me if I just insulted her. Everytime I try to tell her that I didn't say that and tell her what I actually said, she always answer with ""Oh so now you're switching up"" or ""stop messing with my reality!"" I've managed to have one good conversation about it with her, but it seems like she forgot about it. She also have a lot of memory issues, she forgets about things a lot which does not help.

I don't know how to approach the issue anymore, I try to be supportive and understanding. I'm always apologizing for things while telling what I actually said and what tone I used. But it seems to just be getting worse, we can't even go a day without one of these incidents anymore. What am I supposed to do, how can I help her?

(There's a lot of mental issues in her family, including multiple cases of depression and schizophrenia. My gf believes she might have DID. I feel like it's an important thing to add)

Thing I forgot to add: She also see people that I can't see. For as long as I can remember, she has been telling me about that girl that was always with us, and that was sleeping in the bed with us. I've caught her talking by herself a couple times too. She told me that they sometimes tell her bad things about me, I wonder if that could be where what she hears come from.

After this I’ve got a low end customer facing job at the airport which I’ve been doing for the last years and which I know I could do something much more interesting, and challenging.

But that wouldn’t be viable for me to do it, it wouldn’t solve my problems, I would just escape from them, and they would be just here waiting for me, also I have a couple responsabilities back home that I can’t abandon like that.

is it impossible to have decent relationships with other people when one is severely affected by mental illness?

Social media attention addiction ,1,1.0,1716755102.0,"I used to be a semi popular content creator back in 2019-2020 on Tik tok, gaining thousands of likes and tens of thousands of views on every video I posted, when that started slowing down because of the algorithm change and overall just things slowing down naturally, I didn’t take it very well, I must’ve been around 16 at that time and it took a massive blow on my mental health because I thought what I was doing wasn’t good enough or that people were losing interest in me.

By now I’ve completely abandoned tik tok and I’ve been focusing more on posting my art to Insta and Twitter, but I’ve never been able to break through like I did on Tik tok all those years ago, the things I post barely get any attention anymore, on Twitter my content manages to get maybe 1 or 3 likes, while it’s a bit better on Insta, my fragile ego just keeps feeling like I’m doing something wrong or that people just don’t care about me.

This is a very narcissistic rant and I didn’t even realize it until I started writing it down, im just so addicted to the high of getting all of that attention that it almost brings me down into a state of depression when I don’t meet the standards I’ve set up for myself, which sucks because I genuinely love what I do, but I’m scared that this hunger for attention I won’t get will end up killing my drive and I’ll stop doing what I love.

I don’t know how to get over this, it feels like I can’t get over it",mentalhealth,splendidspaghetti,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d1abbr/social_media_attention_addiction/,0
Hot mess survivalist W/past who's nvr spoken out like this...Long read 📚,1,1.0,1716756031.0,"(33 F) I'm a hot mess, fake it till you make it, don't air your dirty laundry type, but this is anonymous so let me try since talk is cheap. 🤞🏼🫣 I've never been able to speak on this per stigma of the medications and my own mental health.  ... Long story short ... Mom passed at 16, beautiful upbringing with horses, step dad lost his mind and the house, sold my horse, I became homeless at 16 learning to survive. That's all I know how to do. Fast forward: child at 19, BD leaves me (1st for everything and HS sweetheart) ; involve myself with someone else (19 M) who is there with me through the birth and claims 1st born as son (19 and naive) then starts drinking heavily resulting in cheating and the beginning stages of DV;drugs , drinking partying , I did a lot . My poor liver. Fast forward, moved to LA... big mistake but fell in love with my now 10 and 6 yr olds father (at time was 18 M) . Trauma bonded HARD. RIDE OR DIE. I still love him . Together for 12 years solid. Becomes a logger , with logging comes drinking and DV. He commits $CD  by 🪢. I find him. Life flighted to OHSU in Portland OR. Life support. Everyone blamed me. Drs said he wouldn't make it and if he did he would be a ""veggie"". He learned to walk and talk.  Years later back to drinking and I'm almost taken by God himself. Finally broke out of that marriage and it was extremely painful.... Been working hard on myself with a primary and Psychiatrist with very involved methods. Built myself up...just to feel like I tripped and fell. BF (32) comes in and guides (rough rocky stubborn road) together almost 2 yrs and starting to feel a disconnect, anyway: BACKSTORY : Mother was told I needed put on Ritalin as a child but my mother disapproved. Fast FWD; 3 weeks ago, at 33 years old, my new psychiatrist added onto that long list of other mental ickiness, underneath the words PTSD, OCD, DV Survivor ,, generalized anxiety, high blood pressure, dissociative disorder and severe depression disorder; there it was...the only thing I needed validated to move forward without forgetting something (pun intended ) "" Severe Combination ADHD"" . 
Relief set in that I really am NOT crazy! I'm aware. Of way too much. Tapering off the Xanax (6 mg/daily) that went to Klonopin(4mg/daily) and Haloperidol(1-2 mg daily) back to Klonopin then Valium (10mg at night, now down to 7.5 nightly). Switched from high dosage Celexa to a lower dose of Fluvox and will continue this taper until I (hopefully) don't need it anymore. Yes, Adderall XR was prescribed, but at a starting dose (20mg) that has changed my whole reality and the concept of time... Still struggle but I have awareness of TIME. I've done all of this with 3 children whom I never lost custody of, left, or gave up. Yes all are in counseling and sports. 14 yr old made principals list. 10yr old can share feelings and awarded for perseverance; 6 yr old is so bright, he reads to his class often . Thank you for reading. Not sure how to feel just yet .",mentalhealth,Wild-Recover7210,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1d1anco/hot_mess_survivalist_wpast_whos_nvr_spoken_out/,0

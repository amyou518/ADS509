My daughter is scaring me tonight. No idea how to help.,924,0.98,"My daughter (10) very suddenly this evening said she feels like she's in a dream/ like she's not real/ like she's a ghost. Said she feels like she's going to die. She doesn't look great, almost like she's sick, but she says she isn't sick except for feeling like she's going to die. Her pulse is normal.

I had her take a shower, brushed her hair and she put on her jammies. Tucked her bed with beach sounds and told her to relax and picture being at the beach. Walked in a couple of minutes later and she's crying.

I'm really worried but completely clueless. My husband thinks it's her ADHD/Adderall, but this has never happened before. She has been very moody and temperamental lately.

My mother having sex with me in the same room damaged my relationship with sex,613,0.97,"When I was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend. Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.

So my wife got induced Friday morning and things progressed fine all day. They gave her an epidural at 4PM Friday and things were good. Around midnight the baby’s heart rate dropped which caused my wife’s to drop.. 

We had every nurse on the floor in our room in seconds. They flipped her on hands and knees, woke the on-site surgeon and started prepping the OR and a crash team. They got her and the baby stabilized in about 15 min. So that was at midnight. 

She labored through until it caused too much stress on her body so they sedated her and put her on oxygen for a few hours around 4 AM Saturday. She progressed to a little over 9cm. 

Around 9:30AM Saturday she gradually stopped having contractions and essentially going backwards.

 They ended having to doing an emergency c section at 11ish. 

When the baby came out he wasn’t breathing and didn’t for the first 5 min. They had to resuscitate him all the while they had a hard time stopping my wife’s bleeding. So. Much. Blood…. It was all over.. The drs discovered some infection while they had her opened up and had to look for more infection which took them longer. I watched them pull my wife’s insides out asking for help with the bleeding and the NICU nurses flip my child’s lifeless body around to get him breathing. 

So I bounced around the operating room  between my wife and child checking on them for like 20 minutes being completely helpless. 

Both baby and mama have gotten the all clear and are at home recovering. No immediate issues with either of them.  I know it’s silly to be upset because we came home and are doing okay when so many people don’t get that opportunity. I just can’t get the OR out of my head. It’s playing over and over.

I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],448,0.96,"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected. 

*The point for this post is that I DO NOT want to go mentally insane from everything that happened. I do not want to wake up one day in the mental hospital. My mental state is very shaky right now. Please help me , I don't know how but please help me. I don't want to lose my health*

am i in the wrong for reporting a consensual sexual encounter?,438,0.95,"so basically i (21f) was baker acted (for those who don’t know it’s a mandatory 72 hour hospital stay for mental health) after, in my case, a suicide attempt. the hospital brought me to the psych ward, and i was put on suicide watch overnight there at 10pm. the guy (27m) who was the one watching me immediately started flirting, making super sexual comments, asking to see my body, etc. he was hot and i was in such a dark place so obviously i played along. like when he came in i was crying and saying how worthless i felt, etc. anyways, he started saying how much he wanted to have sex with me and how much he wanted to kiss me, so eventually he told me that if i went into the bathroom he would “have to follow me” since that was part of the suicide watch. in the bathroom we made out, and did other things, but not actual sex. this went on basically all night (10pm-7am), having sexual conversations, making out, talking about how we would meet up when i got out (he would get me pregnant and we would run away together), he got my phone number, etc. he gave me a fake name, and i later found out that he was married with a child. 

it was all consensual in the moment, like i never told him no, but thinking back on it i feel like he took advantage of the mental state i was in, and his position of power to get what he wanted. it feels like when a police officer gets with someone they arrested. 

all that to say, i feel like i did the wrong thing. i don’t know if i’m a victim. i feel like i ruined this man’s life over something that i said yes to.

I hate being a guy sometimes.,392,0.93,"
I’m (17m) a freshman in college, and I’m feeling really defeated today. My roommate has been watching sneako/ love live serve (red pill guys), and it’s bothering me. We were getting along just fine and it’s not like we’re not cool now, but there’s glaring red flags about him and it’s getting hard to ignore.

The thing is i’ve always struggled with my masculinity and having male friends in general. I feel like online is the only place where you find other guys who aren’t macho stereotypes with a hate boner for women and fueled by homophobia. I was hoping in college it’d be different but I’m feeling the same societal pressure I was feeling before. 


Maybe it was unrealistic for me to think things would change but idk, I just want to have like minded friends who want to hang out.

She said it’s just a platonic friendship. 

She asked me to send a reply because she didn’t know how to spell a word so I scrolled up the chat but not all the way and it was just him trying to help he with selling the product, he’s in her class at university. 

There’s also more signs I think she’s cheating - she constantly accuses me of talking or looking at other girls, and gets mad. She will hit me if she thinks I looked at another girl in public. She will avoid sex and avoid seeing me because she’s “tired” or “ate too much”. Her schedule is always busy etc and when she does meet up she’s always in a mood with me for no reason.

I ruined my girlfriends life,365,0.9,"My girlfriend used to go out with this boy who raped her twice, I wont go into detail but she seemed to never care when i went with her and even thought it was okay since she was his girlfriend. This made
me really mad as she is still friends with him as he’s gay now (supposedly as he still seems to always be kissing girls but he has done stuff with boys so I don’t know anymore).

 And one day after arguing with my girlfriend he kept trying to keep her away from me saying ‘???? come up and walk with us’ whenever she was with me, she was friendly with me and we had resolved the argument from the previous night. She kept going with them as it was all her friends (but it was only the boy who called her over and cut me off) and i didn’t want to seem possessive so I kept telling her to go over.

 And then i started to get really mad (i was already not right in my head) and started shaking with anger and thinking of what he done. Then we were standing and i said we had to go somewhere and she said ‘okay’ whenever he came over and said she had to come with him somewhere else without me.

 I flipped and punched him and started shouting at him that ‘he isn’t allowed to act like he’s better than me after raping her’. Police got involved and took me off him but now they had to tell her mother who is now depressed because of it and she still doesn’t want to lose him as a friend and now her whole freindgroup is split up alienating the boy.

I wish people understood or cared about the psychological damage of small penis shaming.,353,0.93,"Growing up a boy, society repeatedly makes sure you understand a few things about being a man. On for those things is that a man is supposed to be big. Both in height, but especially in penis size. You see that any man who's small is to be treated with ridicule and scorn. And you see that men with big penis are treated with admiration and praise.

Feeling weird about some stuff my mom did to me and I just want answers.,344,0.99," So, recently I was thinking about some things my mom has done while I was younger, I’m 17F now. She would make me shower with her from 10-13 even though I was showering by myself during this time and she would wash my private parts with her hands, not a wash cloth.

 I felt weird about it but didn’t say anything. I would also lay down in the bed with her and she would start touching my inner thighs but nothing further. Also, she would make me and my brothers rub her feet but she would make weird moaning noises and said that she had a foot fetish. She also made a weird joke about how she would show me what it’s like to get molested and tried taking my clothes off jokingly?? I remember being very uncomfortable.

When I was around 14, I told her that I had a boyfriend and she slammed me on the ground and made me tell her information about him and would not let me go. 

 Also, (last month) I was dealing with issues with constipation and she bought me this laxative device that you have to stick in your butt to do. I have trauma from that era specifically because I was raped in July and she knows that, she even knows that specific area is just a source of trauma. But, she made me take off my pants and kept insisting that she put it in her for me. I kept saying no and that I would do it myself but she kept pushing me. 

I literally was screaming no and she said that my stepdad does it for her all the time. Eventually, I started crying and having PTSD flashbacks so she eventually backed off and apologized. I don’t know what to make of any of this?

My parents were having sex next to me and it fucked me up,313,0.94,"Hi guys. Just wanted to vent a bit about some of my childhood traumatic experieces.
When I was a child my parents had been having sex next to me in the same bed. My first memories are from around when I was 5 years old. They were doing it thinking I was asleep but I was too scared to tell them I am not and that I see and understand everything. I started then to make some noises during their sex so they could feel uncomfortable and they stopped doing it since I was about 7 because they moved me into my own room.
The thing is that it made me sexual way too young. I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...
I feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.

Update: Thank you all for such a support. I feel much better after reading your comments about the fact I was just a child and is not my fault I wasn't taught about sex and what's right and what's not. I also want to mention that I am a female and already an adult, it was more than 20 years ago but I kept this within myself for a long time because of shame and guilt I felt.

I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,314,0.98,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

"How do I say ""no"" to I guy who won't get no for an answer?",305,0.98,"Hello, I am 17F and I have been asked multiple times to have sex with a dude from my town (22M) but I refused every one of them because: He is not my type; He has a history of leaking nude pics of girls; He won't use protection; He is a druggie and probably has something; He has herpes as well.

I am really scared because he has cornered me before in an attempt to SA me and I have gone away with it because of period and stuff. I can't report him since I can't prove his wrongdoings.

Found out my daughter is cutting herself,307,0.99,"I (32F) just found out my (13F) daughter is cutting herself. She said it’s been going on for a little more than a week. Her brother was the one who told me.

She showed me them and they are superficial and don’t need immediate medical attention.

I tried to remain calm and just not overreact or panic. I let her know that I’m sorry she was feeling so strongly that she resorted to hurting herself and I let her know that I don’t think badly of her and I want to help her.

She agreed that she would like to get help so we are going to get a referral from her doctor for a therapist on Wednesday.

She said she does it to relieve stress and when she’s feeling upset but that it isn’t a suicide attempt. I let her know that we need to find another way for her to release stress since this is dangerous.
I took her with me to work and school today so we could spend some extra time together. 

I’m not sure what else I can do. I’m trying to keep it together but I do feel terrible that she is feeling so low. I wish I could take all her pain away.

Edit: *Update*
Thanks for all the support! Even though I tried my hardest to do what was best it still felt like I wasn’t doing enough so it was very reassuring reading through everyone’s comments and experiences. 

We got a referral from her pediatrician so now we are waiting for therapy. In the mean time we have been doing more activities together and she has been a lot more open to trying stuff. 

Yesterday was rough because I spent some one-on-one time with my son (9) and she felt a little betrayed after we were spending so much time together. At first she didn’t want to talk to me but eventually she came around and I told her it’s normal to feel that way and she’s still important even if I spend time with her brother. 

My son has ADHD (and possibly autism, we are in the process of getting an evaluation) so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside. It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn’t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don’t allow children under 15. 

She even stopped wearing her jacket which I felt like was huge so I think we are making good progress.

What the fuck did my older brother just do?,304,0.95,"Hello. I'll post this because I am really... utterly disgusted and in disbelief of what just happened. I might delete this later or whatever, I don't use reddit that much.

For context, I'm F18. I left our home at the age of 17 to enter a state university miles long away from our home. It takes me months to return home and I came back for a week long vacation (for long holidays) last Monday. Since I will be returning back to the city I'm currently studying in tomorrow, I wanted to at least bond and catch up with my older brothers since I've been away for months. We weren't that close, but I understood them more now since I've accepted to just let things be (again for context, my older brother stopped in college and currently out of school youth).

I was with them (my siblings' room), we were having fun, my 2nd older brother [M21] was in the lower bunk bed and me and my oldest brother [M22] was together in the top bunk. We were laughing and all, playing games, then my brother hugged me while I was playing games in his phone while we were also chatting. It looked sweet to me because we were not really touchy, he's introverted, and I innocently thought that we're getting closer. While having fun chatting and all, he kept on caressing my stomach and asked where's my navel at, and he touched, caressed it so much that I felt gross and laughingly told him not to touch it while still playing the game. 

He then on proceeded to fucking ask ""where should I touch you then"" and unhesitatingly put his fucking disgusting hands on my chest LIKE IT WAS FUCKING NOTHING and whispered ""here? can I touch you here? please let me"" LIKE A FUCKING UNEDUCATED CREEP. I was so grossed out and can't think properly at the moment so I chose laugh it off and got out of their room saying I'm sleepy already and needed to rest since I still have a long travel for tomorrow.

It was so, so fucking creepy since I didn't expect my brother to be like that. In context, my 2nd older brother is just the same. He also did something like that when I was a minor. And I was raped when I was in preschool. I know nothing at that age, but I remember it until now. I allowed that person to do it because I know nothing... I really don't know nothing. I was so vulnerable. I was just a child. When my parents asked why my medical results says that there was blood in my vagina and all, I was so nervous, scared, and got angry at them. I didn't understand it, but in my mind I was so scared if they knew (it's like having sex and telling your parents you had sex at that age). Looking back, it was so gross and I just wanna cry. I don't want to elaborate it further about what happened afterwards. I tried to forget... even until now.

Please... please help. I've been through a lot. Not just this but things way worse than an 18-year-old should experience. Please help me😭 what should I do it felt so fucking, fucking gross like it won't ever fade away even if I scrub all over my body and bath again and again. I feel so dirty. I am so fucking mad right now. I was reminded with everything. Am I still supposed to understand, knowing that these guys know no shit? I AM SO MAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I WANT TO CUT MY WR1ST AGAIN FOR DISTRACTION I CANT WITH THIS FUCKED UP LIFE IT'S HOLY WEEK FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS😭

TW: What they don't tell you about hanging yourself,295,0.99,"A much needed premise: I miraculously survived hanging myself back in February of this year.

It was not the first time I attempted unaliving myself but it was the first time I was actually going to be successful if things hadn't turned out the way the did.

I had done my research about this. I could not fathom doing it any other ways that I thought were ""too painful and gory"", either for me or for the person who would find me.

So, after that, I was hospitalized for a month and a half and they changed my meds after 3 years and I have to say I am now in a much better mental state and ready to talk about this.

If you ever thought about doing this you may have a picture in your head of how it's going to go. I had it too and it couldn't be further from the truth of what happened.

So here's the reality check:

Firsts things first, it is not ""painless"" at all, it is not ""slowly drifting to sleep"". Your body will get SO MAD that you are doing this and it will react in the worst and most painful ways possible.

To start, you won't have control over your limbs. I remember seeing my arms in front of me with the hands all tensed up like a zombie. It felt like my tendons were slowly getting shorter and shorter and I couldn't move them. I always thought when the survival instinct would kick in the arms would go up to the rope in an attempt to lift yourself up. And it's true that your brain will think that, but trust me, you will have NO CONTROL over your movements. You want to lift the arms up overhead and they just slap around aimlessly.

Then you will feel like your head is going to explode and your eyes are going to pop out. I felt my whole face go warmer and warmer and starting to tingle like crazy.

And that's not even the worst part: it was the lungs for me. You see, your body will get to a state of primal survival instinct where it will do anything it can to just catch a breath. But since the airways are blocked, your whole torso will tense in and out with so much force that your lungs and stomach hurt like hell. Think of a worm curling up when you touch it. Your body will do the same over and over, in and out, each movement more and more painful than the previous one. And it's not like you can control it. You can't. My whole abs and back muscles hurt as if I had fallen from 3 stories for like 2 weeks afterwards just from the effort my body was making by trying to get some oxygen.

I won't even go into how it ends because it's just fucking scary. I'll just say that there's a point where you have the lucid thought of ""I am dying, and there's nothing I can do about it"". And it's the most terrifying yet real feeling ever. It's not ""calm and peaceful"" like you make it out to be in your mind before doing it. It's sheer panic. And when you have this thought it's like it lasts a millisecond but you're now stuck in this state that doesn't leave you.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I feel like some people need to hear this. I certainly would have had second thoughts had I known it in advance.

I won't go into how I survived because I honestly still feel guilty and embarrassed about it. Just know I had to be resuscitated twice and can't remember a thing after that panic feeling. That would have been the last feeling I ever felt. Not peace, not relief.

I am now convinced there's absolutely no ""painless"" way to go and I'm scared as hell for when it will be my time to go in the future. I still have these feelings sometimes, to end it all but I have to admit I am now an official coward.

So yeah, would not recommend. It was NOT worth it.

The love of my life attacked me last night. ,288,0.98,"We’ve been together for 11 years. We’ve been through hell together. In that time I watched him do an insane amount of work on himself. We both have mental illnesses but we both see doctors and take our meds. He had some kind of mental break a few days ago. We went to the doctor. Then the hospital (I was flabbergasted they didn’t admit him). Last night it all went to hell. He got hyper fixated on my son. I was very concerned so I called his grandma to take him back to the hospital because I was going on three nights mo sleep watching over him. He thought my my 21 year old son was in his room with his (my partner’s) ex girlfriend. He kept running up to his room insisting he needed help. I managed to get him outside and made my son lock himself in the house. 

Then it came to a head. He started ranting and raving and screaming. I tried everything. I tried pretending like he made sense. I tried begging. I tried singing. Finally I saw his Mamaw pulling in. Then my partner, the man whom until a few days ago I had never even had a real argument with pounced on me. We went down and starting grappling. My glasses flew off. He tried to get me in a choke hold but I went under and got my throat out of his grasp but I still couldn’t get away. I was screaming “it’s me it’s me stop”. I thought the love of my life was going to kill me in the headlights of his grandmas car. His Mamaw and papaw approached. That seemed to affect him. I was able to wriggle away and I just ran home.

Please Stop Recommending Pets as a Mental Health Fix,283,0.96,"I’ve seen this several times under a lot of posts on this Reddit, and I’m not saying pets don’t help. I don’t want to discount the experiences of people who says pets have helped with their mental illnesses, and I don’t want to discredit scientific studies that suggest having a pet elevates your mood.  However, a pet is a living creature that requires a lot of care, and if you are so depressed it is hard to keep up with your responsibilities, a pet might add to your stress rather than helping relieving it. This really reminds me of those couples who fight and fight and they think having a baby will fix their relationship. 

Please remember that pets aren’t props used to help humans, they are living creatures with their own feelings and needs. I don’t want to discourage you from getting a pet, but please only get one if you can take care of it, not just to help with your mental health.

My friend says he’ll never forgive me because I called the authorities for a welfare check after he told me he was contemplating suicide,281,0.95,"

This morning, one of my best friends called me and was in tears. He spoke about frustration and suicidal ideation. As someone who suffers bipolar disorder, I completely  understood his pain and where he was coming from. I tried to calm him down but then he hung up on me. The last thing he said was “I’m really sorry. You won’t hear from me again very soon. Thank you for everything”
And then for thirty minutes, I tried to reach out to him but I couldn’t. I travelled out of the state for the weekend and I’m 3 hours away. He stays alone and I don’t know any of his neighbors so I was forced to ask the authorities to go to his house for a welfare check. 
They did and determined he was fine. He then called me and said he would never speak to me again or forgive me for doing that. But I couldn’t live with myself leaving him alone after talking about killing himself. I feel horrible like I betrayed his trust but another part of me feels like I did the right thing and maybe potentially saved his life.

Not coping from hearing my parents “doing stuff” at night,280,0.96,"This is gonna sound so weird and creepy I’m sorry I don’t know what to do I really hate how I feel about it and I don’t know who else to tell. Around two years ago or so around covid lockdown time my dad was heavily drinking a lot, he did before and that’s a whole problem in it’s self but I was home to witness it a lot. There was a period of about a month when when he was drunk he would come up in the middle of the night and force himself on my mum , he is already a control freak so me and my brother can’t close our doors and he would keep theirs open too even though out rooms are next door. Basically every other night I would hear this and it would give me breakdowns every time crying panicking and not knowing what to do with myself. For some time I tried to intervene cause I felt horrible for not doing anything which just made it 10x worse and ended up with him threatening to kill me if I ever did it again and our already bad relationship being worse. I tried to talk to my mum she did admit sometimes she didn’t want to (I have physically heard him push her down and her saying no) but she gave me the sex is good talk and told me to leave it and stop intervening. Once it drove me crazy to the point of self harm just hearing it made me feel so sick and I just needed any type of distraction from the sound , it doesn’t help that past 11pm I cannot be awake or watching tv so it’s hard to drown out the noise. That was around 2 years ago now I still live at home and I’m 18 now my dad has stopped drinking but our relationship is unfixable even when I hear anything remotely similar I start that crying and panicking again sometimes it feels like I’m making up the noise in my head and it’s been happening on and off for two years.

My 21F ex has slept with my 20M friend and I am not ok.,267,0.96,"Long story short, me and my ex lived together over a year and as things were ending, my friend came to live with us as he was starting a life in the area. Shortly after, me and my ex broke up and he decided to stay and help her. She struggles a bunch mentally and really needs someone to stay with her so I didn't find this to be a bad idea.
They eventually started to get super close and I started asking them if they ever might get together. I was wanting to be prepared in case they ever did. My ex claimed that she's not gonna say no and doesn't want him out of her life if he brings her happiness. Yesterday, we were talking more about it and it pretty much came up that they have slept together.


What really hurts is that me and her had a unhealthy relationship and that we hadn't had sex in over year due to what we thought was her mental problems. Due to this and some other factors, I started acting distant in the relationship and she believes that was holding her back from wanting to be physical with me for the last year.

Why was I sobbing after sex?,261,0.95,"I met a guy at a bar and we went skinny dipping in th ocean that night. Truth is I did feel apprehensive and anxious,  I know it was a bit risky, but I trusted his energy and it went beautifully.

We had sex and afterwards I was sobbing really hard, he held me through it all and it was a huge release I think. But when he texted me this morning I felt anxious again and when we met I felt like crying again. He's showing me no reason to feel this way about him, so I don't know what it's about..?

I ended up going to her office at the time we had scheduled. Upon arriving, her office door was locked and her car wasn’t there.

Ive been through sexual abuse around 4-5, and 7 years old. I have been through physical abuse at 4-5 years old. I have been bullied and choked at about 11 years old.

There are other things in my life that have happened that have also had effect but i was happy to finally feel free of all of that has really had an effect on my life. 

Im a new me. Im ready to heal. Im ready to change.

Your therapist really does care about you.

We think about you outside of sessions.

Sex is disgusting sometimes- I think I might know why?,230,0.92,"I lived with my dad for a little period of time and did always go to his cottage whenever I was off school. One thing was- he would always fuck his girlfriend/wife at the time very loudly. At some point I started getting really annoyed by it because I would storm out of the house screaming “STOP having sex when I’m here”. It kept happening. I was glad it happened in a different room but you don’t understand how SMALL this cottage was. I could hear everything and that girl would do it on purpose so I could hear it.  They would do it in their room and do it in the bathroom. It echoed so much. 

It was always the have loud vigorous sex, come out of the room with such confidence and going to the kitchen table to have a cigarette and a coffee. That’s the pattern. Daily. Constantly.

I knew she did it on purpose because my relationship was always terrible with the girl. She was jealous of a young girl because my dad loved me. I was jealous of her because I knew she didn’t deserve my dad and that she was pushing him away from me.

I think it got to a rotten point where I got myself off on it because I was so used to it happening every night. I think this part is what is getting me... I was only 11/12-13 at the time doing all of this. It only continued from there until I moved out. There was nothing I could do but wait on the couch and sleep there until it was over. I didn’t realize how fucked up it was to do what I was doing. But truly -because I was so exposed that -I thought it was normal to do so. I think it’s affected me even now just because of what they did- and what I’ve done while that was all happening. I feel cursed. Disgusting. Confused. Vile. Sad. Desensitized. Not normal.

I continue to think about it Til this day, and it grosses me out and sometimes it will pop up in really awkward moments. I feel a rise of anger when I hear any form of moaning or sighing- I get scared or weirded or grossed out while trying to have sex. I will have flashbacks when having sex. I get fear from it sometimes. I hate to be touched sometimes- and it has a lot to do with this.

-I’ve also been through some weird instances where my dad would slap my ass “as a joke”. Who does that all the way up til they’re 13?
- I used to be laying on the couch and I swear to god at some point he was watching porn around me. He was doing it in the kitchen at the table. I know this because I heard the moaning and at the time there was only me and him around the cottage 


-stumbled onto my dads only laptop and found a bunch of legging porn videos.. also stumbled onto his only camera and found nudes of his gf. I’m finding all of this at the age of 11-13 years old.

-edit: my dad and the girlfriend left me alone a lot with the girlfriends son and daughter at the time. The daughter same age as me and the son 16. At the time I was 13. we were in my dad’s girlfriend’s cottage. The son had a few drinks and he started to give me a small amount of attention and sleazily asked me to be his girlfriend that night. Later on he pressures me into giving him a BJ and I do it because I want a boyfriend - and the morning after he breaks up with me. Stone cold. I actually thought we were gonna be together but he actually just used me- then becomes my step brother  a few years after. I think I got really lucky for being the heavier/ fat girl at the time because it would take a lot more for him to take MORE advantage of me than he already did. It was my FIRST memorable sexual experience that was NOT good. He kicked me out of the room right after he couldn’t nut.

I also have a faint memory of being around the age of 5 and playing with a younger boy and we were in a closet stripping. Thankfully we got caught. I asked my mom and my sister if that ever happened because clearly the other mom probably would make a scene out of it knowing what just happened - but they both said they don’t recollect this at all. I think I’m going insane with this guilt of being so young but also pushing myself onto another person that way.

It just gets really fucked up. Also people think this is a LARP.. which is really really sad. Because this legit has happened. What am I lying about for. I smoke weed daily just to not cry- I have self harm scars from when I was ten just from crying for ANY form of attention. I have physical and mental regrets throughout everything I’ve been through. I can’t lie.

I finally got a therapist that’s good at her job and now I am livid.,203,0.99,"Alright, I got a story for y’all. 

I had an eye opening therapy session yesterday, and I just wanna share about how I never realized things that happen to us as a child can have such lasting subconscious impacts on us for the rest of our lives. 

Ima bout to get real with y’all, and share an experience that happened to me. 

This is something I have a suppressed memory about it, and because of the way adults have portrayed it to me growing up, I always told it as a haha funny story. These fvckers spoke about it as if it were a joke and now I’m angry.

Something about me, is if I ever feel as though I’m in trouble I shut down. I go non verbal, and it’s hard to come out of. Therapist asked about it, and when I first felt that as a child. I first said something about being put in the corner as a child and if i talked I had to stay longer. But then it hit me. 

As a child, I had pretty bad adhd (still do) and would never stop talking. Got on a lot of people’s nerves. So, one night a relative was babysitting me. I was younger than 5. (Likely around 3/4) I wouldn’t stop talking and bothering her. 

So what does this relative do? Duck tapes my hands and feet to a bed and put tape over my mouth, and left me in a room until my mom came back to get me. 

My mom was livid. Unfortunately she’s passed since so I can’t ask her about it. 

After that, adults, my father included would ride around with duck tape on the dash of their cars and threaten me with it if I misbehaved. 

Every time that story was brought up by the people in my life, it was told as a funny story, so that became my association with it. To this day, it’s brought up as a funny memory. 

I just never made the connection before about it.

I found my mother dead yesterday,199,0.99,"I (21F) found my mother (56F) passed away yesterday morning outside in her chair. She was suffering from terminal lung cancer and was in horrible daily pain. She had gotten her diagnosis just a few months ago, and although it was terminal my family wasn’t expecting her to go so soon. We really thought we’d have a lot more time with her. We actually had a cookout planned that day so the family could come over and spend time with her. I can’t get the image of her slumped over in her chair out of my head. Seeing her pale face and my heart just stopping. Trying to wake her up even though I knew she was gone. I feel so numb and I don’t understand why. I feel like I should be crying more but I just can’t anymore. Nothing feels real. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. It doesn’t feel fair. I feel like I’ve been robbed. I have so much anger I don’t know where to direct. My mother didn’t deserve to die so early nor should anyone have to lose their parent so young. These past few months leading up to this I’ve been in a depressed haze, cutting off friends and isolating myself. I was starting to feel the loneliest I’d ever felt in my life but now I think this is it. I have nobody to talk to about this. I’m just so sad. Support or advice would be appreciated.

UPDATE: I don’t use Reddit much so I’m not sure if everyone who replied will get notifications for this: 

I just wanted to post a update and thank everyone who has taken their time to comment and reach out .  you guys have no idea how much all this support has meant to me. These past few hours have been extremely rough. I’m not going to lie, I’m still a bit numb. I just can’t believe my mother, the women I’ve known my entire life is gone. I will never see her again. It shatters my heart all over again every time I’m reminded. My mother was the most caring and beautiful women I’ve even known. The morning she passed, she woke me up very early at 2am asking if I was okay. This was very unlike her. I’d like to think in some way she knew what was coming and wanted to spend some time with me before she left. My best friend and I recently reconnected right before my moms passing, they have been keeping me company which has been really helpful. Surprisingly I’ve been laughing a lot these last 2 days more than crying. I think my mom would have wanted that for me. Although I’m still incredibly lonely and depressed about her passing, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. As my mother is no longer suffering in pain, she’s completely at peace now and where she always wanted: in the afterlife with my grandparents ❤️ 
Again thank you to all the amazing wonderful people who took their time to leave me heartwarming advice and share their experiences. I was losing hope in humanity for the longest time but posting my experience here  has brought me nothing but peace and encouragement. You all are the most wonderful people imaginable and I can’t thank you enough. I really didn’t expect so many people to see this. I rarely ever share my feelings with anyone so this is very new for me. I’m going to try to book an appointment with a therapist sometime soon as sharing here has showed me there’s nothing wrong with opening up to others.

My psychologist told me something I wish my parents had told me,193,0.99,"I'm 36(m), and I went to my first ever therapy session ever. I've been battling depression, anxiety, and stress for almost my whole life. I have my good days and bad days, and it has been a terrible 6 months. 

I opened up to my therapist at first, just snipits of my days and issues, and it turned into an hour of me spilling my heart out and overloading her with information. 

I knew I had dyslexia and showed signs of ADHD, and it has been left untreated since childhood, and now it is affecting me even with the simplest of tasks. 

She said that I have a thinksy mind that overthinks and over exaggerates simple things. She went on explaining it all and trying to help me rewire my thinking. 

Then she said something I didn't expect, she said it was not my fault that I could learn those topics in school, it wasn't my fault that I could not understand those math equations. It wasn't my fault that I couldn't pay attention for 8 hours straight in a jail cell like room. That I wasn't dumb or stupid because others didn't understand what I was going through. If my parents understood my condition and helped me out from a young age, I wouldn't have to go through this.

Wife is going through breakdown and told me she wants to divorce,189,0.98,"My wife of almost 15 years (we have been together for 21) decided she wanted to divorce me suddenly before a work trip. She knew I was going alone and would be isolated. 

I spent the first few days in a hotel room in a strange country in complete shock. All the emotions ran through my head. I blamed myself, every little comment said. 

A few years ago she suffered from an incredibly paranoid phase (thanks a lot pandemic) where she thought the neighbours were spying on her and everyone was out to get her. I work away a lot so I'd come home to find her in this state. The ""cameras"" always ended up being garden lights or motion activated lamps, but when I pointed this out (after 6 months not so tactfully) she seemed to withdraw from me. 

After that we had a yoyoing relationship, where she would tell me one moment she loves me, the next a divorce. We always sorted it out because I love her and want to support her and the kids unconditionally. 

I noticed her withdrawing. She would be in the same room with me, but not in spirit. She would explode at me in anger for the smallest things, and the big things she wouldn't seem to care about. 

She decided to go on medication, which helped. Although she became more of a robot and lost all interest in any form of intimacy. It broke my heart. 

She came off of them about a year ago and things started to improve. We became physical (although at the worst of times she would have sex with me and throw it in my face on the next angry outburst, calling it rape etc. I never forced her into sex at all, but did complain we weren't intimate many times). 

So, this latest situation was only three days ago. I'm still in a hotel halfway across the world, but my father rang me this morning. 

Apparently she stayed at a female friend of ours house last night because she thought the neighbours were spying on her. She told me that she is hated in the area and that she will be sent back to her home country (she has been living in the UK for over 20 years and is from Europe) and the kids taken away. She strongly believes it to be true. 

My father picked her and the kids up and she adamantly wanted to report everything to the police regarding it. The police obviously didn't take it seriously. Our neighbours are all 80'ish years old and not malicious. A pain, but not malicious. 

So as I sat here, pulling the threads on everything bad I'd done (because she will often use anything I've done wrong as ammo) when I get a call saying a mental health nurse is visiting her. She's at my Dad's with the kids. 

I love her with all my heart. She's a fantastic mother and person. But she will just torture me over and over and I stay because of this love. I worry about the kids and how she'll cope. It breaks my heart. 

So I just carry on working, supporting her and trying to build our family. I've turned into a persuer it seems, trying to hold us all together. Always initiating conversations. Trying to understand her feelings. She wouldn't make the effort to talk first. 

Did she really mean she wanted a divorce? Or is this just symptoms of her MH? I can't leave her when she needs me, and although this is effecting me I can take it. I want her to be safe and feel better but she's breaking me down with the constant swings in feelings towards me.  She is an amazing person at her best, but at her worst it's like Jekyll and Hyde. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so what was the outcome?

*Edit*

I was arrested straight off the plane. They aarested me on suspicion of Rape and coercion.  I was taken straight to the police station and was just released pending investigations.

I've picked my car up, but I'm not allowed to contact her, go to the house without police escort, go to her place of work (which I wouldn't) go to the school. Where my kids attend or ask anyone to talk to her for me.

I've never raped her. She thinks having sex because she felt guilty whilst not objecting is rape because she didn't really want it. She's saying this happened multiple times. I'm feeling broken

Looking at the past history, I think she has BPD. The re-writing of the past, the annoyances at very minor things. Disassociation and acting. Obviously this isn't a proper diagnosis, but reading it all was a lightbulb moment.  I think I've been discarded.

For about two weeks now, I have been feeling miserable and ashamed of myself for living with my family. I feel guilty for feeling this and I just wanna cry about it because I’m so filled with stress. Every morning, I feel the worst sadness.

Sexual encounter has left me utterly broken,171,0.93,"TW: SA/Infidelity

Long story short, I (25M) blacked out at a party and when I came to I was naked, had thrown up. I had sex with someone. I remember some bits: 

Saying I needed to go. 

Stopping the girl from holding my hand. 

Asking to stop and offering oral sex instead. I think I said “If I go down instead, can we stop?”

I know i put myself in that position, I let myself get taken advantage of and I know that I was the stronger person and could have stopped it. There was some complaincy with me and honestly that’s the worst bit. Instead of just fighting and stopping it I tried to quietly finish it off and leave. I don’t know why I didn’t. I feel disgusting, I feel violated, I don’t know how to act. 

This isn’t the first time this has happened to me. I’ve had naked photos taken while I was asleep (arguably more serious) and I’ve laughed it off. I’ve been fine. I’ve woken up to a guy on top of me after a party, again, I was fine. This event has devastated me. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t finish a day at work. There’s nothing in my tank.

Worried I’m a pedophile,172,0.86,"
19M

I wonder if I even AM worried at all. Lately I’ve been feeling apathetic towards my mental issues/habits. Hell, I don’t even feel annoyed/bothered by the things that usually annoy/bother me. The worry feels fake, I think. Then again, my “self-aware” thoughts tend to feel fake.

But anyways, I met this person on Discord and we both produce music. I showed them my music, they showed me theirs. They were fun to talk to, and it felt completely platonic. They asked me if I was an adult, and I said I was 19. They said they were fifteen. I don’t know if they’re male or female, but something hints at them being female.

Now, I don’t remember feeling any attraction to this right away, no, I don’t think I did. But I think my mind wants to convince me and say “what if you did feel attracted? Maybe you don’t remember.” 

I never fantasized/thought about them sexually or anything, ever. I don’t like to say it, but I did kind of feel a bit attracted, not even sexually. Of course, my mind doubts that and makes me wonder if I do/did feel attracted sexually. But I did daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually)?

The attraction felt more like a romantic one, not sexual. Still, that should bring concern, but I don’t feel concerned. I don’t even feel concerned that I don’t feel concerned. It seems like my mind keeps getting more and more messed up.

————————————————————————

It doesn’t stop here. I sometimes catch myself “looking” at much younger girls, and daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually, more like attracted to my face and just my face), but this hasn’t happened in a long time. I sometimes avoid looking at them this way, and keep my eyes away and instead focus on their face (which doesn’t make me feel attraction, but of course I doubt this).

”Daydreams/fantasies” on my OWN never feature any underage people. 

And of course, I feel apathetic. But, I do think this whole issue is gonna make it a bit more difficult for me to enjoy things.  I wondered if I’d be able to enjoy dancing anymore, because “yeah that guy dances well, but he’s a pedo, so…”

—————————————————————————

If it’s any help, I’ve never used underage characters (like lolis for example) in things like AI chats, only actual adult characters. I’ve never used porn like jailbait porn or “barely legal” or anything like that.

And I am attracted to people my age. I just wrote “too,” but deleted it, and I think that means something.

I also always have the wrong reactions/opinions, like when people say pedophilia isn’t a sexuality, I feel opposed.

———————————————————————————


Edit: Nearly everyone here has told me it sounds like POCD, but I feel like it’s more than that. I can’t deny that I did daydream of little girls being romantically attracted, I can’t deny the attraction to that fifteen year old.

I told the fifteen year old that I couldn’t talk anymore. I then unfriended them. I felt something when I saw their profile, it was only romantic but mild, I think. Mild or not, it was romantic. It quickly went away once I no longer saw their profile, but still, it was there.

I had a child loss. And I am okay.,165,0.97,"Hi, about ten months ago (Feb) I had a miscarriage. I saw my dead baby. Yes, it wasn’t just a pile of cells. I’m pro choice, so whatever you would like to call it for yourself, then go right ahead, anyways. 

I’ve been struggling a lot. I loved them so much even though I didn’t know them well. I knew how they made me feel, and what they were doing to my body. I knew I was excited and loved them with my whole heart and body already. 

It took many months after my loss to finally name them. I never got the chance to know them well, so naming was hard. I decided to go with Jordyn or Jordie for short. 

The name Jordie comes from my cousin, who I love so much, and is one of my favourite people. And I love the name Jordyn, especially for a feminine person. 

I’m doing okay. I know that it’s not my fault. My baby wasn’t developing properly, and would have been born either very sick, and miserable, or passed away, like they were. 

They are at peace, and I’m coming to that point now. I miss them everyday. But I also have an amazing partner to help me through everything. 

I’m going to be okay. 
One day, I might meet them again, and who knows in what way?

No matter what, I know they wouldn’t blame me, because Jordyn was sick. 

I am still a parent. 
I am still a mother.

Edit: I identify as enby. They/them. Not a woman, but still a mama🩷🩵🩷

Edit 2: one in four pregnancies end in loss. It’s not as common to lose your baby in the second or third trimesters, but it is just as valid. I lost Jordyn in the second trimester. I was supposed to be 15 ish weeks pregnant, but when they passed away, they were only the size of a 7-8 week baby. I just felt like I wanted to share this information. 

I’m also going into grief counselling to help support myself with my journey of not being a mom anymore. There’s a quote that I really love, it goes like this:

“I carried you every second of your life, and I will miss you every second for the rest of mine.”🩵🩷🩵🩷

I also plan on having a funeral for Jordyn in the future, if I still have trouble with grieving. And that’s okay. They were loved, and still are.

I texted my mom and asked if she was making noise . Didn't get a response and went to my studio area . Didn't fall asleep. At 4 30am my mom frantically ran to me and told me to hurry quickly. She had found my grandma in her master bathroom on the ground and needed help turning her over . I turned her on her back and she was dead. 
Blood came out her nose and mouth. Mom was on the phone with 911 . Gave her CPR . And she was just gone. She had been gone, she was cold with no pulse. Unexpected and out of nowhere.
She was fine last night. 

I feel guilty. I had the thought to check on her when I heard that noise because it had me frightened it was so strange of a sound. But I didn't want to wake her up and it was storming. There's 3 dogs in the house . I assumed it was in my head and it could of been. There was no sign she fell and hit her head or anything like that . It seemed she was probably gone when she hit the floor. But in my head and heart I keep saying what if I had went in there ... if I had maybe my grandma would be here still. I hate myself right now . This is the worst day of my life. I lost my papaw and that was bad. But this is something else... I was talking to her last night about how I'd lost weight and just chatting . And now she's gone...

My mother hung herself in the woods yesterday.,161,0.98,"This doesn't feel real and I am going through throwing up and being in denial. My mother suffered from bipolar but was pretty good at masking it around people for most of my life. I just turned 33 and as her daughter I never expected she would be out of my life forever at this age. This year has been terrible because something triggered a 10 day manic episode in January where she basically burned every bridge. Once it was over she couldn't get over the shame and fell into a deep depression. She was hospitalized multiple times but could only seem to be kind of act functional for a week or so back at home and then get so depressed again that she wouldn't eat or sleep. 

She moved in with me and I really thought I could help her but it was a cycle of her acting somewhat hopeful to a deep depression. Yesterday we got into an argument because I found out she has been lying about taking her meds. We exchanged some words and she got into her car and sped away. I really didn't think much of it and thought maybe she just needed space. After too many hours went by, my sibling and I started blowing up her phone. 

I finally filed a missing persons report while hoping she just went to a hotel or something. This morning the doorbell rang with two officers holding their hats. I already knew what they were going to say but they said they were very sorry but they found her body and she hung herself. My brain isn't processing this at all.

I think I fucked up by being honest to my professor...,165,0.95,"Basically I emailed him asking a simple question about my grade. He asked me why I took ""so long"" to email him about this, because I only saw the grades right now, but they got released two months ago.

In 2 small paragraphs and 4 sentences in total I very briefly explained to him that I got in a delirium today from my cat getting lost and spiraling into a depressive episode from being in a very stressful environment (basically my friends treating me like their therapist). I explained I have issues for which I am on my way to get properly medicated for which causes me, among other things, extreme anxiety to see my grades, and that I hadn't seen my grades in general in almost a year. Therefore, getting in a delirium and becoming deeply unstable and barely holding onto reality, I decided that that moment was the safest one for me to see my grades, because I'd get the least shock from being most detached from reality.

Of course he hasn't responded, I don't expect him to, but I'm scared I fucked up by telling the truth when the truth is... this. I find it difficult in general to lie, but especially in times when I lose control. I was even preparing to lie to him just in case he'd ask me something like this, but I knew I had nothing to back up my lie. And being upfront was kind of the only way for me to actually justify being so late in emailing, because that's just the reality.

I just want to get my degree with my own dignity... I hope I don't make these people hate me forever for being like this and thus stop me from receiving what I study so hard for...

Edit: Before I go to sleep I want to clarify 2 things. Number 1 is that I don't judge my professor at all for not responding to me, I would do the same in such fragile situation. Number 2 is that for me, none of the information I shared were things I ""hide"" from anybody casually (not in a professional setting of course if not prompted). There's a myriads of other things I hide, which are way more severe and unsettling to the average Joe. Sharing *those* things for me would be considered **for my own boundaries** as oversharing, simply because the information I shared is almost my entire life. I have nothing to say about my life if it's not that, which just covers the surface. Of course my definition of oversharing may be objectively wrong, but that's my personal definition of it. But besides the open ended conversation that is naturally unfolding, my main concern is about type of emotions this information could evoke to the other person, such as falsely making them believe I lied, making me look inappropriate to work in the industry, making me look difficult to work with, etc.",mentalhealth,the-fourth-planet,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15hbkih/i_think_i_fucked_up_by_being_honest_to_my/,41,173.6842105263158,8.684210526315809,0.00037027038489943125,"['basically', 'emailed', 'asking', 'simple', 'question', 'grade', 'asked', 'took', 'long', 'email', 'saw', 'grade', 'right', 'got', 'released', 'two', 'month', 'ago', 'small', 'paragraph', 'sentence', 'total', 'briefly', 'explained', 'got', 'delirium', 'today', 'cat', 'getting', 'lost', 'spiraling', 'depressive', 'episode', 'stressful', 'environment', 'basically', 'friend', 'treating', 'like', 'therapist', 'explained', 'issue', 'way', 'get', 'properly', 'medicated', 'cause', 'among', 'thing', 'extreme', 'anxiety', 'see', 'grade', 'seen', 'grade', 'general', 'almost', 'year', 'therefore', 'getting', 'delirium', 'becoming', 'deeply', 'unstable', 'barely', 'holding', 'onto', 'reality', 'decided', 'moment', 'safest', 'one', 'see', 'grade', 'get', 'least', 'shock', 'detached', 'reality', 'course', 'responded', 'expect', 'scared', 'fucked', 'telling', 'truth', 'truth', 'find', 'difficult', 'general', 'lie', 'especially', 'time', 'lose', 'control', 'even', 'preparing', 'lie', 'case', 'ask', 'something', 'like', 'knew', 'nothing', 'back', 'lie', 'upfront', 'kind', 'way', 'actually', 'justify', 'late', 'emailing', 'reality', 'want', 'get', 'degree', 'dignity', 'hope', 'make', 'people', 'hate', 'forever', 'like', 'thus', 'stop', 'receiving', 'study', 'hard', 'edit', 'go', 'sleep', 'want', 'clarify', 'thing', 'number', 'judge', 'professor', 'responding', 'would', 'fragile', 'situation', 'number', 'none', 'information', 'shared', 'thing', 'hide', 'anybody', 'casually', 'professional', 'setting', 'course', 'prompted', 'myriad', 'thing', 'hide', 'way', 'severe', 'unsettling', 'average', 'joe', 'sharing', 'thing', 'would', 'considered', 'boundary', 'oversharing', 'simply', 'information', 'shared', 'almost', 'entire', 'life', 'nothing', 'say', 'life', 'cover', 'surface', 'course', 'definition', 'oversharing', 'may', 'objectively', 'wrong', 'personal', 'definition', 'besides', 'open', 'ended', 'conversation', 'naturally', 'unfolding', 'main', 'concern', 'type', 'emotion', 'information', 'could', 'evoke', 'person', 'falsely', 'making', 'believe', 'lied', 'making', 'look', 'inappropriate', 'work', 'industry', 'making', 'look', 'difficult', 'work', 'etc']","{'neg': 0.119, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': -0.9624}",negative
"I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this, but does anyone else create alternate worlds in their head where they see themselves as another person who’s basically who they wish they were and imagining every aspect of their life as if they’ve lived it, if not should I be concerned?",161,1.0,"I put NSFW because I’m not sure if this could be triggering for some people and this may sound very strange, but I have a bunch of different worlds in my mind with several different people who are all basically the opposite of me. This initially started over quarantine because I was stuck in the same house as my family. They like to dig into your insecurities and even made me feel like I’m ugly, so I thought up a girl who doesn’t have those insecurities and was just all around beautiful and imagining what kind of life she would lead. The only one I’ll be going over in this post is “Sasha” which was a name I had liked due to being a big Bratz fan when I was younger and I had hated my name because it’s not very common and not only had an apostrophe, but also has a capital letter in the middle and was often made fun of. Since then, I have learned to love my name and switched her name to be mine. To better describe her and her life, she’s a beautiful dark skinned Afro-Latina woman who has long dark brown hair, she has an hourglass figure, and the most beautiful brown eyes in terms of looks and I often times will stay awake simply imagining her face and wanting to cry or scream. In terms of what she’s like, she has a very sweet personality, but she’s much more confident than me and takes crap from no one, she’s seen as the most perfect woman originally at school and later as an actress. She at some point got married to my dream man and they had kids who were practically the definition of perfection. That was originally just my little escape from reality, but it very quickly started consuming my day to day life because I’ll start thinking about this during important things or shut myself off from the world to get a quiet place to focus on how to make that world more so perfect. My parents aren’t the mental health help type so I generally talk to my older sister about this stuff, but that doesn’t help because my sister has never felt anything even remotely similar to how I feel.

Recovering from depression is worse than depression itself,161,0.98,"I have been majorly depressed for years. During that time I lost relationships, took gap years from college, isolated, missed out on opportunities, gave up on everything I was talented it, and have led a life that I am not proud of. I never wanted to be around others because I knew that I was a burden to whoever I talked to. 


Now that I have in many ways made great strides toward recovery (or at least better coping mechanisms), I almost wish I hadn’t. Depression was comforting in a way. It filled some type of void. Now I look back at almost ten years of emptiness. I feel like dying would have been better because my life is like looking back on someone who was dead. I feel like my life is completely worthless. I understand that the sentiment that comparison is the thief of joy, but looking at the lives of others my age I don’t see the point. I feel like I will never have a full life, like I’ll always be behind. I’ve tried everything. This is one of the first times I’ve really allowed myself to process these feelings and it sucks but I do feel like I need to be honest with myself. Stuffing all this down and telling myself I’m happy just because I’m not depressed isn’t true. I’m not suicidal anymore but I truly do wish I would drop dead or something.

he will have sex with me though. so recently i have been asking for sex a lot more. he is now saying that i’m only with him for sex, i’m using him for sex, etc. he says i only seem to enjoy his company when we’re having sex. the truth is, he’s right, but it’s not like that. i feel so upset being around him lately because i don’t feel loved by him anymore. the only time i ever feel loved and desired by him is when we’re having sex.",mentalhealth,Cautious_Interest838,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/16nwxno/my_bf_thinks_i_use_him_for_sex_but_its_the_only/,65,168.42105263157896,8.42105263157896,0.0003590500702055091,"['boyfriend', 'together', 'month', 'sex', 'always', 'amazing', 'however', 'recently', 'mental', 'health', 'getting', 'worse', 'simultaneously', 'think', 'relationship', 'struggling', 'recently', 'cut', 'clean', 'ashamed', 'apologised', 'promise', 'never', 'happening', 'accept', 'apology', 'say', 'disgusting', 'made', 'think', 'differently', 'ever', 'since', 'acting', 'call', 'pretty', 'cuddle', 'rarely', 'kiss', 'feel', 'unloved', 'undesirable', 'sex', 'though', 'recently', 'asking', 'sex', 'lot', 'saying', 'sex', 'using', 'sex', 'etc', 'say', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'company', 'sex', 'truth', 'right', 'like', 'feel', 'upset', 'around', 'lately', 'feel', 'loved', 'anymore', 'time', 'ever', 'feel', 'loved', 'desired', 'sex']","{'neg': 0.144, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.4787}",positive
I'm suffering in iraq as a 13 year old iraqi turkmen,159,0.92,"I'm suffering in iraq as a 13 year old turkmen male pray for me please my turkic brothers

I'm a iraqi turkmen suffering alot and don't trust iraqi propaganda or kurdish propaganda 

Iraq is a hellhole

I suffer daily as a 13 year old

Poverty is quite common

Saddam added his image to all books and he persecuted turkmens

Urban areas are full of beggars

The education here is soooo shitty we get 60-80 hard exams yearly and 30 questions per exam 5 divisions of questions 

We have to read the whole book 200 pages and barely get anything out of it to become 'smarter' out of 1000 questions we memorize we only get 3% of those how useless

My father is exploited by the iraqi government and we can't even go back to our ancestral countries 

Any iraqis who are struggling seeing this i don't deny it because iraq is in bad condition socially 

Iraq has power cuts everyday and 6 times a day

The educational ministry brainwashed all turkic people here explains why they're patriotic 

Christians here aren't that persecuted but 2 governorates najaf and karbala persecute them and teach them their propaganda 

Iraqi conquerors killed 100000 central asian turks and raped 50000 and forced them to join the army and become arabs, this is also the reason why many iraqi turkmens support the siege of baghdad 

If you're wondering why us iraqi turkmens don't seem to be related to iranian turkmens is because we're iranian azeris

My turkic brothers are any of you here for me

I often feel negativity towards iraqis


The education here is VERY manipulative it explains why kids are patriotic

If you do not raise a iraqi flag during a mawtini performance then the school will beat you

And kurds here make policies harming us using fake information and they've kurdified many turkmens in erbil and they stole jarmo from kerkuk and called it 'the oldest kurdish village' while kurds didn't exist at that time

Fuck Kurdistan (government only)

I am an introvert have been dealing with social anxiety for the past three years. I've been through some traumatic experiences through my life.

I am 34 years old man. I have been there for people my whole life. Helping anyone in need. Emotionally supportive. Going above and beyond to help people who are at the lowest. I just want to see people happy and am willing to go to any lengths to make that happen. Never looking for any personal gain out of it....Just waiting for the universe to save me as I have been saving others. I have lived so many different lives and roles for others in my 34 years of existence that deep inside I do not know who I was before or who I am now. I am empty now and I feel after all this time I don't want to continue living. All that grows within me is hatred and disgust for humanitybas a whole. These humans helping others for clicks and views...Abandoning people when there is nothing to gain personally...Manipulating and gas lighting others to seem more likeable...these humans get all the praise and love from everyone around them.

I have tried to discuss my mental health with her numerous times but she has either cut the conversation or changed the topic.

I am disgusted by my existence. All these years of being there for others has led me down to this path of having no one to talk to or even be heard. People have no regards for anything I have done. I am forgotten. I know someone is going to bring up self worth and how I am placing it in others and seeking validation from others...but is it too much to ask. I feel I have wasted my whole life. I should have been selfish and just lived my best life and I would have been at a better place feeling more fulfilled.

"""Ugliness survey"" at the hospital exacerbated my body dysmorphia",153,0.98,"I'm a 30 year old woman. I've struggled with body dysmorphia since childhood, mostly fixating on my nose (which has a bump and is crooked, so there is what you might call a ""real"" issue) as well as a general sort of ugliness that I cannot specifically place.   


This past summer I was hospitalized for anorexia and once I was transferred from inpatient to outpatient, they enrolled me in a few group therapies. One of the nurses in the program had me email her photos of my face from different angles and distributed these photos to ten anonymous staff members at the hospital, and asked them to answer questions like, ""How ugly is this person out of 10?"" or ""How much does this person's nose ruin their face?"" and so on. We wrote the questions together.  


Before she did this exposure I expressed multiple times that I feared I would be at risk of self-harming upon seeing the results, and that I really did not want to do it. I asked if I could opt out and she said yes but continued to bring it up and ask me why I wouldn't do it until I eventually agreed.   


The results came in and were varied. A couple people rated me a ""10"" for beauty, others a ""4."" More than half said that my nose does in fact ruin my face (ratings of 6-10 out of 10).   


These results were very distressing to me, less because of the numbers themselves and more so because I felt coerced into doing the exposure and because there was no follow up or after care. The nurse read me the results, gave me the ""raw data"" and excused me from her office. This was in July, it's mid-October now, and I am still struggling with this information.  


This is of course not the ""cause"" of my dysmorphia, but I'm feeling unable to get past what feels like confirmation of my ugliness. I have trouble leaving my apartment or working while my partner is home because I fear he will look at me and see how ugly I am. It is disrupting my every day. I am in therapy with a general counsellor and also a trauma therapist, so two sessions a week, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the BDD. I also research it and read studies and articles about the disorder to try to better understand it. I consider myself in most ways a very reasonable, giving, dedicated person, friend, and partner, but I am so totally fixated on my ugliness sometimes that I fear I will drive others away.  


I guess I am asking two things: 1. Is there any hope for dysmorphic patients? I haven't felt like I've made any progress over the 12 or so years of therapy, and 2. Is this kind of exposure experiment normal?  


Thanks very much in advance for any insight.

There are so many bad therapists,149,0.99,"I've just been feeling really disheartened about the state of mental health lately. I work in a mental health field where part of my job is referring clients to therapy and helping coordinate their care. The problem is, I spend all this time trying to convince a client to go to therapy, just to submit a referral and have them get assigned to a really awful treatment provider. It feels terrible. Like I made them promises that this would be a helpful thing and then sent them somewhere that did more harm than good. 

I know there are great therapists (I've gone to one), but I've had personal experience with bad therapists too. It's a really harmful thing, because therapy is a very vulnerable space and is not the place where you want someone who has no idea what they're doing. And yet, there are so many providers out there that are really, truly bad at their jobs. 

When I bring this up, I often hear the response of, ""well not every therapist is the right fit for every client"" and I think that's true, but I also think that many therapists are just objectively bad. It's not a ""personality clash"" it's a lack of training and quality supervision.

My dad was arrested for possessing pictures of kids,144,0.95,"This is my first post on here but I need help

My dad was arrested a few years back and was found in possession of child pornography.

(Context)

My dad was a highly respected professional in the teaching field until he was arrested and charged with possession of CP. After discussions with himself, my family and the solicitor who fought his case, I have developed some understanding of the situation. Suffering from trauma in his childhood, he had been searching through dodgy forums etc. to see how these people interacted with one another, whilst simultaneously getting extremely drunk. It was obviously a stupid thing to do and I feel like I have to believe that what he is saying is true as I do want to trust him.

I think back to my childhood, going round to friends houses, seeing their parents not drinking and thinking that was strange. This was only because of the copious amounts of alcohol he would ingest of an evening, from whiskey, to vodka, to endless cans of beer. But growing up and seeing this, day in day out, made me believe that this type of consumption was normal. 

When I initially found out what happened, I had received a phone call off my dad explaining vaguely what the situation was and as soon as I put the phone down, I couldn’t stop crying and I came to the conclusion that I wanted to end my life. I had my note written and I was ready, but in the back of my mind all I could think about was how I would never see my family again - and I ended up calling Samaritans (who were amazing might I add).

Anyway, this was 3 years ago, he was given a suspended sentence and community service, and life as a family hasn’t been the same ever since. He still lives at home with my mum but whenever I go back home, there is just a feeling of constant sadness and all of the happiness that I used to feel around my family is a relic of the past. 

I suppose the question I want to ask is, how do I move on from this? Obviously I’ll always love him unconditionally, but everyday I just feel more and more resentment towards him for the situation he put us all in - losing contact with countless friends and family members, having to prevent him from meeting any of his grandkids, all the looks and comments you get, and I could go on all day.

I don’t want to cast him out but it feels like I’m constantly grieving my dad, fuck, sometimes I think it might’ve made things easier if I was actually grieving him.

I have a habit of calling out sick excessively. What’s wrong with me?,145,1.0,"At every job I’ve ever had, I’m always in the habit of calling out sick at least once a month. Otherwise, I will be miserable and/or burnt out. And when I’m going through something super stressful at work, it increases to once a week or every other week. 

Some days it’s because I genuinely feel depressed or scared to go to work. Other days it’s because I feel like it’s something I just need. Like today. I feel healthier at home and I just feel like my brain needs rest and a reset. It feels silly to call out because of this, but I *know* it’s something I need. And I know I’ll feel slightly more mentally prepared to go back to work tomorrow if I call out today. 

And no, taking vacation time doesn’t seem to help much no matter how I break it up (one day a month vs a whole week). It doesn’t feel like it actually does anything for me. I’ll still feel just as bad going back to work after a day or week off. I think it’s because calling out is more of a crisis thing for me.

Is it wrong to dump my bf because he’s depressed?,140,0.78,"He’s a really great guy, super caring and loving,  and I would love to build my life with him.

But I feel like it’s selfish to leave him when he’s depressed. Thoughts?

EDIT: many in the comments are asking if he’s seeking help and if I’ve done anything I can to help. I have, many times, tried encouraging him to seek therapy and medication, to hang with friends (both with and without me), to do his hobbies and exercise and go out on walks. I literally do this encouraging daily. I also am always a shoulder to cry on when he’s having a tough day and listen to him and encourage him to talk about his feelings. He is now in therapy and medicated thanks to me, but it’s not helping much. I also have had many tough convos where I tell him this isn’t sustainable for me in the long term. On the other hand, I also occasionally experience depression and anxiety and he’s been supportive to me during those times. Which is why this is a hard decision.

I (27M) hit my ex-girlfriend (24F) over and over again and I really don’t know whom to talk about it,135,0.76,"What the title says, no excuses no more lies.
I broke up with my ex more then a year ago, during our relationship I hit her various times and I can’t remember how many times nor the details. After our breakup while talking she panicked, I asked her to leave my house and after she didn’t, I hit her and kicked her on the ground, this is the only episode I can fully remember and it terrifies me. 
Nothing similar happened during my previous relationships and I’m not a misogynist or anything of the kind, my friends respect me and when I tried to talk about this they made up excuses and told me she was lying because of her mental health issues. She went to the police and they didn’t believe her, I never said a word to deny it, and I told her I would not fight it if she had reported me, I would have told the truth.
I left the city since then and live hundreds of miles away, I’m trying to rebuild for myself a stable and decent life but this memories haunt me. I can’t spend one single day where I don’t have vivid memories about me being physically abusive and I really have no clue how to move on in my life being this piece of shit. I can’t even imagine to try a relationship again because I’m scared I will be physically abusive again. 
I’m afraid that if I talk to my friends they will judge and leave me but I really need to talk about this with someone and I need to tell the truth. 
Psychologist is not an option because I don’t earn much money and I can’t afford it.

Boyfriend wants to break up with me if I don’t give him enough sex and now I don’t know what to do,133,0.87," THIS POST HAS MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

Going through a very rough time right now. I’m suffering from major anxiety and panic.

My boyfriend of 3 years has lost his patience I guess and is basically breaking up with me if I can’t provide him with enough sex. (We’re both in our 20’s looking to live together soon)

I was a victim of sexual assault/abuse as a teen and he knew this from the beginning of our relationship. We’ve always had issues with sex but some months are better and some are just kinda dry. 
He told me a week ago that he can’t sit around and wait til I get better and start controlling my sexuality anymore and I need to give him more intimacy and sex. 

I’m incredibly hurt. I’ve given him alternatives that don’t include me and I would even be open if he would satisfy his needs elsewhere. 
I really want to stay with him because I love him but my only way to save this relationship is to force myself into giving him more sex. We do it every one-two months or so. 

Is that really not enough? What am I doing wrong. My libido is extremely low and I have a lot of stress all the time. I’ve been trying to work on it for ages buying different sex toys and trying to get rid of my physical pain during sex too. 

I really thought he loved me for me and that he wouldn’t just leave me for a lack of intimacy… he’s not giving me more time unless I basically promise him I will get better and we will do it more often soon. I feel not enough. I feel unsafe and I feel let down. Will I ever be enough for him? 

What do I do… I’m heartbroken. I don’t know if I can save this relationship. I’m very desperate as I really love this man.

And I’ve loved my life especially the past year.

A couple days ago I got hit with a very tough situation which you can read about on my page in r/texts. The important think to know is that I had a lapse after so long and I was contemplating suicide. I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t know who to talk to so I made the post on Reddit.

Little do I know it blows up. Hundreds of people reassuring me of the situation, over 40 reaching out in private messages, giving me genuine advice and the reality of the situation. It eased my mind and dried my tears. I was in a really bad place and I can thankfully say that Reddit has very possibly saved my life because it could have ended very badly.

There was also a lot of insults in those comments, a lot of people being harsh, but the good outweighed the bad and I didn’t care.

This is to get some positivity and hopeflowing in here that it will be okay and someone always loves and cares about you. Even if it’s strangers.

I just started feeling so much rage for this statement when it's a response to all the trauma the parents caused to a child. More like they failed at the bare minimum they were supposed to do as parents. They did their worst, not best.. And they don't even pay the consequences of the hurt they created, everyone just excuses them and it's almost wrong if the victims of them feel hate towards them..

We don't even treat children, victims of those parents, with the same respect as animals.

My ex’s sexlife makes me sick,125,0.78,"I was in a relationship with my ex for 1 1/2 years, at the beginning of the relationship she told me about her sexual experiences which were 2. The one was a cop with an extreme superiority complex. He wasn’t asking her for permission slapped her hard, had sex too hard. She didn’t know what she was doing and just let it happen. 
Our sex life had problems because of her past experience, but after a while she enjoyed it a lot. You could say I opened her the wonders of the sex world. But during our relationship, the thought of that cop experience always stuck with me an made me sick. I get very frustrated and angry when I think about it and start too feel like I need to throw up.
Now that our relationship is over for about 3 months, i get even more sick by the thought of it.
I’m scared that she will go back for him just to have sex. I just hope it doesn’t happen.
Is this feeling I’m getting normal? Should I visit a therapist about it?

Thanks in advance!

I’m in a really dark place after the breakup and thought I can post here something, because I have no one to talk too.
My only real friend was my ex :(


Edit:
Thanks for all the support, but I owe some of you an more detailed explanation of the phrase “wonders of the sex life”. Yes I see it seems sketchy to say that. What I meant, was that she never experienced a partner who cared for her well being while having sex. Like taking it slow and listing to her body. She never had orgasms in the instances before or a sense of pleasure. 
And for all the people saying that she had different kinks and all that stuff. Later on we had our spicy adventures.

I still grieve, yes, but I sensed that everything gets Easier on me

This world has no magic and it's unacceptable.,124,0.93,"When I was young I found the cheap looking, plastic tiara and rod which advertised as it is for 'enchanted fairy, at discount store, and naive thought was going on. One day I read a novel about a family that can bring the force to shield evil magicians, hidden in remote place of mountainside. I was very into said book with scripture so I actually tried the babbles in the room for over hour while holding my breath, drew my whole force and willpower to do the 'chant and fantastically resulted nothing. Later I got the said fancy rod at mall and read the instruction, was so happy to summon a small friend with it But I realized there's no battery at home. And quickly realized that I have no money at pocket. Even worse it doesn't seem to make me a cute magic familiar.

""How this world is livable without magic..?

""So this was lie, ok but how about that one?

My brain was looking for other option after this big disappointment, and this kind of disappoints, drowned me into deep sadness. It was just lie. The world is lying to me.

As writing this post as adult, still I think it's better to disappear from this world and reborn in fairyland instead. This way of start is just terrible and destined to cause mental illness, all isn't enchanted and I can't do no magic. This cold fact is absolutely drowning me in tear, no life can be reverted from death and I'm hopeless after that, while I'm slowly dying inside of short lived cage, ultimately lose all those cryptic memoires.

"I'm 16 and my life is already falling apart, all because of me. I'm too weak for this world.",124,0.94,"I (16F) am complete scum. At this point, the only reason society wouldn't discard me is my age and perhaps gender. I imagine that if an older male shared my lifestyle and beliefs, he'd immediately be regarded as a loser/bottom of the barrel. You know what I'm talking about. The guy who lives in his mom's basement, unemployed and loveless.

I'm self-centered and selfish, hateful towards myself, yet not enough to change anything. I have no drive or self-discipline to do anything, I go along with whatever can make me forget my reality. My escapism techniques include, but not limited to: binge eating, maladaptive daydreaming, compulsive masturbation, using character AI, obsessing over media (hyperfixations, as I'm autistic too). I spend my days bedrotting.

I'm extremely paranoid, to the point of delusions, at least according to others. I fear that my family is spying on me/my devices. Which is a major source of constant anxiety, considering the kind of stuff I do. The only friend I had is just like me, with the exception that he was capable enough to get himself out of the hole I'm in. Secretly, I began hating him for it due to my jealousy. Our friendship was just him dragging me around while I complain. I'm glad he stopped contacting me - it's less humiliating that way.

And by reading this, you might get the impression I'm someone who had a difficult life. Not really. I used to be one of those 'gifted kids' that learned to read faster than everyone else, got praised, etc, etc. I was used to having everything handed to me on a silver platter, giving up immediately if things didn't go my way. I'm not self-sufficient, I learned how to do my laundry last week.

Every once in a while, I'll make an empty promise to improve. My addictions are a glaring issue but whenever I try to stop, I get reminded of how miserable I really am. I face reality and I can't handle it. I feel furious, anxious,  to the point of having panic attacks. Which leads me back into my vices again. It goes like this - 1. Spend a week bedrotting and indulging in my addictions.

2. What the fuck am I doing with myself? I could be doing something productive.

3. Make the smallest attempt at being present in my life, at fixing something, at existing.

4. ""Everyone's better than you, you're stupid, undisciplined, ungrateful, incapable, friendless, ugly, fat, etc. Why even try?""

5. \*cue breakdown\*

6. Rinse and repeat

I have a classmate who often tries to reach out to me, which I don't understand. She's hardworking, friendly, ambitious, an overall bright person. The complete opposite of me. I politely turn her down, because she doesn't know what she's messing with. I don't want to drag her down.

Only reason I get up in the morning are my dopamine hits. Nothing else.

If anyone's gotten out of this hell, DM me.

Boyfriend has Derailed Thought Disorder,123,0.96,"My (40F) BF (45M) considers himself an above average intellectual. He is a Data Analyst as a profession. He is proficient in 3 languages. English is not his first language. But it is mine, so we communicate in English. 

He often likes to speak about science, physics etc and he goes on long tangents to prove a theory. The tangents begin with one point and go on to a couple different subjects not related to the original point he was trying to prove. I chalk up some of this disconnected points to English not being his first language. 

I struggle to follow along because I'm always trying to connect what he is saying to his original theory. When he's finally done talking I say ""you lost me babe"" and he laughs and says ""I know, I'm a deep thinker"". Out of frustration I want to say ""NO, that's not deep, you've just made NO SENSE at all!"" 😩 But I've never said this. Instead I distract with a more basic conversation like ""what's for dinner?""

"My sister found out the hard way, that our mom is unreachable.",122,0.98,"So my mom is a textbook narcissist- always the victim always everyone else’s fault she’s never to blame- she’s an angel. She also has this weird trait where the longer time goes by the more and more she manipulates reality in her mind- 1 documented example was when my sister told her she didn’t want to follow my moms path and get a masters in psychology because “It’s stupid and a waste? what have you done with your degree?” - which was/is true mom has a masters in psychology from a major university. So instead of just scolding my sister she parked in the store
parking lot across from her school- locked the doors and proceeded to beat the living shit out of her raking her forearms punching her face ripping chunks of her hair out…..all while her friend is in the back seat screaming…. she did so much damage in less than 2-3 mins the friend said- and then my mom just drove the 20-30secs to the school and dropped off my sister- told her go to class before you’re late- so of course an 11yr old walking into a school blood dripping from her arms patches of hair missing a swollen face drew some attention-Cps was called and we had bi weekly home visits
for 6 months-when my dad got home he was like”WTF vickie what did you do, my
god look what you did to our daughter” and my mom defiantly said “that little brat deserved it she was being disrespectful, and then proceeded to tell us how rude and disrespectful my sister was and how she deserved it” no empathy or apology-
then 6months later it morphed into self protection and minimizing what actually happened- 2 years later it morphed into something completely unrecognizable of the truth “Your sister was trying to yank the steering wheel into oncoming traffic i had to defend myself while fighting her off “

That’s just one story of the woman i’m talking about-So i’ve known for over a decade that anything coming out of her mouth is either a lie or a manipulation 99.9% not the truth or what actually happened.So for the life of me i don’t know why my sister believes the bullshit that comes out of her mouth sometimes. My sister is in vacation in our mother country and calls me telling me mom told
her a story about how dad would hit me and hit her-10000% false that man never laid a finger on any of us-the only thing he could be faulted with was not believing us and not divorcing her faster.He is the definition of a great loving father- everything she’s not. I fucked up and let the beans spill about how not only
did dad never hit us but mom sexually abused me -i’d wake up in the middle
of the night with her rubbing my feet the rubbing my thighs and i blanked out the rest- she would walk in on me showering -
pull the curtain open and then tell me
how the size of my peen compared to my dads…..about how the time mom made me file a false police report against our father saying he hit her or else i wouldn’t get to escape from her and spend a 4 day weekend at my friends(my dad was in oil&gas industry- being a 14yr old kid getting hit for flinching around her - i took every opportunity i could to escape from her- so i went along with her filed a false
police report and my mom almost got my dad fired from his prestigious job- the real reason was $- my dad had limited her access to their $ and she was pissed about it - wanted to get back at him. So i fucked up spilled the beans to my sister and now she’s so angry she wants to make my mom go to the police and file reports whenever she gets back from vacation- my sister now has a
degree of control over my mom
because she gives her 500$/month and pays her 12k/year property taxes. So i get a call from my mom crying and saying she’ll apologize for whatever she just can’t go to the police and go to jail- while part of me wants that, a friend who used to be a therapist told me “It’s like
you’re both living in the past with her” and i believe him- so putting aside the lies the bearings the S/a, i told my sister i feel it would be better if we just sought out professional help to work through this 20yr old trauma and just cut off contact with our mom, next time we see her should be at her funeral.
You can’t reason with a person like her who never sees herself as the aggressor as the demon as evil incarnate.
When i bring up this fact to my mom “How come 4/5 of us plus my sisters friends plus my friends-how come all these people remember reality one way and you’re the only one that remembers things the way you do? how come that’s the case? and she replied with” $ and your father’s brainwashing “ i laughed hung up and blocked her and told my sister i won’t be accompanying her to the police station- i want to seek therapy and move on with my life.

What’s stopping you from ending it?,121,0.95,"
Ngl, I’ve been going through a lot. I’m in my 30’s and I’m not doing too well mentally, physically or financially. I hate my job bc it’s dead end and will probably get killed off by AI or get outsourced in the future. I’ve looked into other jobs but I  feel like I’m just too dumb to do anything else. I have a hard time connecting with people so I don’t have too many real friends. I’ve also never dated or had any woman tell me that they liked me. I was born with a few birth defects so my self esteem is nonexistent. I’m not eating or working out much so I’ve lost a bunch of weight. I’ve been told that I look almost sick.

I still live at home with my family and the way how rent is going in my city, I feel like I will never be able to afford to live on my own. Everyday I wake up, I just want to end it. I think about ending it like a few times a days.

After telling my girlfriend that it’s not true she became very relived and I thought it was all okey. The next day she heard more voices and told me she got it all wrong and it was actually other people that is stalking us and they want to hurt her and me. The people that she says are doing this is my old friend that I haven’t talked to for 5 + and a different kinda friend that don’t know each other.

Even when she tells me someone is speaking I hear nothing. She struggles with depression and anxiety but nothing like this. There is 0 proof of any of this other then then voices she’s hearing.

How can I help my suicidal wife who tried to OD yesterday and STILL won't go to the hospital? I'm at wits end and I'm exhausted,117,0.95,"Update 2-
They are discharging her. Wtf is she that good at hiding shit or is psych at the hospital stupid. Shes texting me so she's been cleared by psych. She keeps saying I love you, and I just want to scream. Think a thick foam pillow would middle scream? 

the system fails again.  So tired of this I can't take care her mental needs. I just want to shut down I'm so stressed I'm hallucinating vividly. reality is weird. 

I still haven't slept probably won't till way later. 

Why do I even try to get her help when the medical system just doesn't care. 

The stray who I fed and let sleep on the porch came by severely injured. I will spare y'all the details. We have no money nor car for a vet.mil said to call animal control. He is an elderly at least 12 years old feral stray with no teeth. I highly doubt they will spend a dime to save him.

 It like when it rains it pours. That cat let me and only me pet him even though hes been here longer then me. We had a bond. He came home looking for help. I'm glad I was there to help him, he got right into the carrier I put outside to trap him so he didn't wander off. 

  I'm overwhelmed
___________________________




Update 1- texted the 988 line someone commented. They walked em through calling 911 stayed on the line with me.  My wife is beyond pissed off at me
 She yelled at the emts for not wearing masks in our house.  But she ended up going because the emts told her it wasn't optional the amount she took was considered a suicide attempt. She didn't even look at me as she left.

I know I did the right thing. I should have done it sooner.

_____

OP

She tried to OD today she's only not in the hospital cause she threatened to leave me if I caused her to be in the psych ward again. But she took TWO huge according to her handfuls of her old lithium that for some reason didn't get thrown out. She says she did throw up about 20 minutes after taking them. So no idea how much actually got into her system.

I sat with her all day in her room and now we both have our bedroom doors open so we can hear each other and easily check on each other ,(our rooms are right next to each other we literally talk by simply talking loud) 

She won't go to the hospital I keep begging her. She has been dangerously suicidal for a year EVERY day she tells me in tears she wants to die. 
She says she will make an appt with a psychiatrist on Monday but she rarely ever keeps her psych appointments she always makes excuses even if it's a telehealth visit. Even if she does and they prescribe meds she won't take them. She will for a week and then stop saying they make her feel weird. I try explaining that that is normal and will go away but she would rather stop the meds entirely.

How can I help her get the help she needs? She says she isn't suicidal right now,but that's besides the pint she took a ton of lithium she needs to be monitored.
I'd prefer she go in the morning to the ER and from there the psych ward for medication management. She says she will take the meds if we go through scheduling on Monday but even so it could take months for her to get in to see someone psychiatrists are heavily booked in our area.

I'm scared I'm going to wake up and find her dead. She needs help asap and I'm not sure how to get her help without losing the relationship in the process.",mentalhealth,scelestai,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/14bnwvw/how_can_i_help_my_suicidal_wife_who_tried_to_od/,99,123.15789473684211,6.15789473684211,0.0002625553638377785,"['update', 'discharging', 'wtf', 'good', 'hiding', 'shit', 'psych', 'hospital', 'stupid', 'shes', 'texting', 'cleared', 'psych', 'keep', 'saying', 'love', 'want', 'scream', 'think', 'thick', 'foam', 'pillow', 'would', 'middle', 'scream', 'system', 'fails', 'tired', 'ca', 'take', 'care', 'mental', 'need', 'want', 'shut', 'stressed', 'hallucinating', 'vividly', 'reality', 'weird', 'still', 'slept', 'probably', 'wo', 'till', 'way', 'later', 'even', 'try', 'get', 'help', 'medical', 'system', 'care', 'stray', 'fed', 'let', 'sleep', 'porch', 'came', 'severely', 'injured', 'spare', 'detail', 'money', 'car', 'said', 'call', 'animal', 'control', 'elderly', 'least', 'year', 'old', 'feral', 'stray', 'teeth', 'highly', 'doubt', 'spend', 'dime', 'save', 'like', 'rain', 'pours', 'cat', 'let', 'pet', 'even', 'though', 'he', 'longer', 'bond', 'came', 'home', 'looking', 'help', 'glad', 'help', 'got', 'right', 'carrier', 'put', 'outside', 'trap', 'wander', 'overwhelmed', 'update', 'texted', 'line', 'someone', 'commented', 'walked', 'em', 'calling', 'stayed', 'line', 'wife', 'beyond', 'pissed', 'yelled', 'emts', 'wearing', 'mask', 'house', 'ended', 'going', 'emts', 'told', 'optional', 'amount', 'took', 'considered', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'even', 'look', 'left', 'know', 'right', 'thing', 'done', 'sooner', 'op', 'tried', 'od', 'today', 'hospital', 'cause', 'threatened', 'leave', 'caused', 'psych', 'ward', 'took', 'two', 'huge', 'according', 'handful', 'old', 'lithium', 'reason', 'get', 'thrown', 'say', 'throw', 'minute', 'taking', 'idea', 'much', 'actually', 'got', 'system', 'sat', 'day', 'room', 'bedroom', 'door', 'open', 'hear', 'easily', 'check', 'room', 'right', 'next', 'literally', 'talk', 'simply', 'talking', 'loud', 'wo', 'go', 'hospital', 'keep', 'begging', 'dangerously', 'suicidal', 'year', 'every', 'day', 'tell', 'tear', 'want', 'die', 'say', 'make', 'appt', 'psychiatrist', 'monday', 'rarely', 'ever', 'keep', 'psych', 'appointment', 'always', 'make', 'excuse', 'even', 'telehealth', 'visit', 'even', 'prescribe', 'med', 'wo', 'take', 'week', 'stop', 'saying', 'make', 'feel', 'weird', 'try', 'explaining', 'normal', 'go', 'away', 'would', 'rather', 'stop', 'med', 'entirely', 'help', 'get', 'help', 'need', 'say', 'suicidal', 'right', 'besides', 'pint', 'took', 'ton', 'lithium', 'need', 'monitored', 'prefer', 'go', 'morning', 'er', 'psych', 'ward', 'medication', 'management', 'say', 'take', 'med', 'go', 'scheduling', 'monday', 'even', 'could', 'take', 'month', 'get', 'see', 'someone', 'psychiatrist', 'heavily', 'booked', 'area', 'scared', 'going', 'wake', 'find', 'dead', 'need', 'help', 'asap', 'sure', 'get', 'help', 'without', 'losing', 'relationship', 'process']","{'neg': 0.135, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.9944}",negative

My friend died and I can't stop playing Valorant,116,0.97,"I (23F) lost a close friend of mine (22F) last Wednesday. It was out of nowhere. We were supposed to hang out that night with our group of friends, but we didn't get to do that. And surely, it makes no sense to me and it never will.  
  
Since I first got the news, sleeping and eating are hard for me. Coincidentally, she passed away on Holy Week (religious holiday here in Latin America, from Thursday to Sunday) so after the memorial, I couldn't stop playing for 10 hours straight. I had to force myself to sleep to stop playing. I'm lucky enough to have found two people on queue which I started playing with and they made me feel better about this situation.  
  
Since today (Monday after Holy Week) isn't a holiday anymore, I had to start working and studying again. It's extremely hard to go back to the 9-5 routine. I had so many activities before this whole thing and I feel like I can't do them. I can just play Valorant to stop thinking about it but of course, it's unhealthy for me. Whenever I'm not playing, I'm thinking of my friend and my heart sinks. So I choose to play to have a little bit of fun and forget about it for a second.  
  
I'm thinking about therapy, since I'm not used to talking about my feelings nor am I good expressing myself. I know right now Valorant is a coping mechanism of mine and I need to give myself time because it's all very recent. I just don't want to get addicted to it in order to neglect my feelings. I feel like if I uninstall or stop playing I won't get even a tiny temporary peace of mind, so any advice, recommendation, would be very helpful.  
  
Ps; I'm not sure why I'm writing this. I just hope I can think of something else other than her, because I don't see myself feeling better, at least in a nearby future.

One Bad Trip Changed My Life,112,0.93,"On October 1st 2013, I smoked some weed. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was laced with an unknown substance. I had a horrific experience. I may have been on the roof at one point. I was all alone, and I live in the middle of the woods, so no one knows what all actually happened. 

Well, a few weeks later, I ended up in the hospital for it. I acted deranged enough that they put me in the quiet room. I was only in the hospital for about a week or two, but I was forever fucked up by that experience. When they let me out, I had to stay with my grandparents because I couldn’t handle being at home for various reasons regarding details of the bad trip. 

During that time, I lost control of myself, and I very violently murdered a few of my family members, and I got put back in the hospital and back in the quiet room by myself.

Now, that last part never happened, but you can imagine how fucked up I was that I believed that I did that. And it still haunts me as if it actually happened because it felt so real. I can still feel my cousin’s little neck in my hands and the cracking it made when I killed him, even though it never happened. I can still see the horror on everyone’s faces as they tried to pin me down. I can still feel my back against the carpet as they held me and cried.

It took about a year, but I got a hold of myself, and I slowly started to be able to differentiate between my vivid imagination and reality again, and I haven’t had trouble with it since.

I despise men and lose sleep after multiple violent incidents caused by them,111,0.78,"I am 22F. The hatred and anger I feel about men now isn't healthy and I can't stop feeling this way. I watched my boyfriend be attacked from behind while he was in the bathroom and he was nearly blinded/killed. I had to throw myself between them as he had passed out. I was taking punches trying to keep his head protected because he had passed out while the men behind the bar and owner (who didnt hire a bouncer) just watched and shouted and didn't step in. It only stopped after he ran away and I was screaming for help. No one called the police or ambulance I had to call his dad to pick us up  After that incident I havent been able to sleep I got put on 5 pills by my psychiatrist to deal with the trauma and flashbacks. I have never went to a party/club and that was our 4th time out. Yesterday at new years the second time we have went out since the incident a man threatened me for moving a jacket, which I moved so I could sit down (it wasn't his, it wasn't mine, the guy who's jacket it was is up dancing he doesn't even know the guy) I wasn't about to sit on someone's jacket so shifted it up a bit so I could sit with my group. It was moved 5 inches and he had 2 seats of space ). I could feel my anxiety creep up after the threat and my boyfriend told him to calm down, there is no issue here and this man slid up behind me (he was 2 metres away) and started threatening my boyfriend telling him to meet him outside. My boyfriend rolled his eyes ignored him and just put his arm around me and kept talking to the group. At this point I was having flashbacks, I started having a bad panic attack, I couldn't breath, tears were streaming, I was gasping for breath. Boyfriend and his cousin noticed and got me outside so I could breathe where the bouncer came up to say he could understand where he was coming from since he was there first (I still have no clue how me not wanting to sit on a strangers jacket and moving it beside me so I wasn't on top of it is worthy of his behaviour) At this point I was just saying between gasps 'i dont actually care about that I'm just having ptsd I don't need this right now'    bouncer walked away and I was being calmed down between panic attacks. I woke up this morning with intense anger. I can't let it go. IV had enough of grown men not being able to control themselves and being violent over something a simple as a jacket that wasn't even his or someone he knows. I'm going to my psychiatrist soon because I can't keep living like this. I have had an abusive father who abused us and my brother has physically attacked me leaving me with bruises and a bloody nose over wanting to watch football in the living room.

I can't keep existing this way...

__________________________________________
**EDITED TO ADD CONTEXT**

My daughter is 13yo.  She has been struggling with ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder), ADHD, and HFA since she we put the pieces together when she was about 3.5yo.

The main issue is her ODD.  If you're not familiar with ODD first-hand, it's really hard to understand the full scope.  She has 3-7 SCREAMING tantrums throughout the course of any normal day.  These typically last a minimum of 20 minutes to upwards of 90 minutes.  Not a single syllable of that is exaggerated.  They will start over simple things like me asking her if she washed her hands before making lunch, her refusing to figure out how to solve simple problems (ex: there's clothes in the dryer and she needs to switch her clothes over), or getting caught in a lie (ex: I can see from the security camera that she did X and she will scream and get violent trying to lie about it).  Before we started homeschooling, we were getting phone calls to pick her up at least 2, if not 3, times per week because she was being violent with the teachers and disruptive of the learning environment.  

These are all very literal, real examples. These literally happen every day... since she was 3yo.

We have done ALL the things... psychiatrist, in-home therapist, special needs program at school, different pediatricians, school social workers, read the books, tried the tactics.  We have heard from no less than a dozen professionals ""wow, you're doing all of the things we typically suggest"" -- but nothing works!  (And I'm Sicilian, so discipline is not lost on me.)

You can imagine the toll this takes on our family life when so much time and effort is put into ending her tantrums so we can do things and go places, including canceling vacations, not attending family events, etc.  For the past 1.5yrs, she's started to get really jealous of her little sister (who is currently 4yo) and she is now her scapegoat.  The added stress of having to protect my innocent, sweet little girl from someone she worships is too much.

The resentment comes from how much emotional energy, time, and money we've put into trying to help her over the past decade+ since we isolated the diagnoses with NO return or no change and, if anything, escalating behaviors as the teen 'tude sets in.  It's like living in an emotional warzone and I would be struggling even if I weren't also BPD and struggling on my own.

My mom claims she has thousands of bugs crawling on her,103,0.99,"I don’t know what to do anymore. My mom 54 years old has been convinced for the last 3 months that she has scabies, or mite infestations. I want to let it known that just over a year ago she was in the hospital for three weeks due to a nervous breakdown. She was having “shakes” and “shocks”, the doctors could never figure out was wrong. 

Life was okay for a couple of months after she got better she was off work for 8 months. She went back to work 4 months ago when all of this started. She started telling our house that the animals had fleas, which then turned into mites. She bought medication for all our animals and claimed the were more free.( even with no evidence whatsoever they even had them to begin with)

About a month later she started telling us that she thinks there’s mites on the furniture. She cleaned the whole house, along with all the furniture and starting making homemade sprays to kill the “mites”. 

About a week later she told my dad that she has scabies. She said she found a rash on herself and that she knows it scabies. Instead of going to our family doctor she called a over the phone clinic where she spoke to someone over the phone who said they recommended scabies cream. She then proceeded to buy said cream and use it. She bought it again and used it again. She now uses scabies cream every week. She has these hives in her body, she’s been putting lotion all over her body along with tea tree oil and homemade mixers as well. She also took all the furniture out of her bedroom, along with clothes and anything really. She then took all the couches out of the living room. Claiming they were infested. 

She refuses to go see a dermatologist, or have an ink test done or a scratch test for mites. She has 4 showers a day boiling hot, along with doing her bedding two times a day. Every time she naps she washes them. She has spent about 3 thousand dollars on mattress covers and new clothes. For the first couple of weeks my dad was supportive and helping her. We all put in this cream to help ease her mind. There’s 4 people living in our house. 

Fast forward 2 months and my mother is very un hinged. I’m feeling extremely uncomfortable living with her. She’s constantly picking at her skin and picking at her bed claiming any little piece of dirt she mites is a mite. She’s even been in my room along with my nans looking at our beds for “ evidence “.

I’m currently looking for a place of my own since I simply can’t handle her anymore. I don’t know what to do and neither does my dad. He’s been supporting her, and trying to understand. But now I feel like someone needs to do something. I’ve heard of Delusional parasitosis, and so far everything I’ve been reading sounds just like what’s been happening to her. 

Today I caught her picking at her skin along with putting a whole bottle of tea tree oil in her hair. She has hives on her neck, as she keeps scratching and picking. She pops the bites on her head claiming she can feel thousands of babies all over her whenever she does this. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. As I fear I’m getting more and more worried about her mental health, she’s starting to scare me. I want to be there and support her but I also don’t want to be an enabler. 

It’s hard to talk to my dad about this, as he claims that we should just let her medicate and use the lotion and hopefully they will go away if she will relax. He’s not really helping the situation. It’s also important to note that my mom does use marijuana, and it’s on anxiety and depression, medication, as well as sleep medication. 

I need help on what to do. 

Any suggestions would be helpful.

We were in their bedroom and having dinner on the floor (his wife, my mom and me). He was on the bed, under a blanket, watching TV. All of a sudden, he calls me to get under the blanket. I didn't want to go but my mom pushed me to go. Then my mom and aunt left the room to do the dishes downstairs. He switched the channel to a religious one where holy songs were being played. Then he proceeded to molest me. He hugged me tightly, tried to kiss my lips, then ran his hands all over my body. I could feel his penis against me. Then he slided in his hands under my clothes and rubbed my private parts. I don't know why I couldn't leave the moment he started touching me inappropriately. I just laid there like a corpse. The trance broke when I heard my cousin come back downstairs. I told him that I needed to go and left. I couldn't speak about this to anybody for the fear of broken relationships. I had to share the house with that monster for the next couple of days. I started developing severe anxiety right after that incident and still hasn't gone away. Although I never spoke to him after that incident, I had to be in the same vicinity because of our familial ties. And it was deeply uncomfortable but I kept shut. 
After 12 years of this, I revealed it to my mother in a fit of rage and she blamed me for not revealing it to her earlier. Her stance was clear that she couldn't do anything about it because it was too late, and it's difficult to pick between your child and your sibling. I was shocked beyond anything by this. When I shared this with my dad after a while, he assured me plainly on the surface and moved on. He continues to share a good relationship with that man, so does my mother. But anytime I bring this up, they try their best to make it seem like it's not a big deal and I should move on because it has been too long. Who is going to make them understand that I haven't been able to process this incident and it ruined what was left of my childhood. I fully understand that my parents' validation to something doesn't define my life. But it's difficult when you live in a brown household. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety since then. There's no way to reverse my suffering.

30 minutes and happy birthday to me! 🎂,102,0.99,"I didn’t think I’d be around for this long, I made a promise to my friend when I was healing and becoming clean and that helped wonders- 4 years ago and now I’m slowly learning to establish boundaries. I’m learning more about myself than I’ve ever before. My parents tell me I’ve wasted time, useless, can’t be helped and why I passed off so much. But looking back from the progress of where I came from to now, I’ve grown tremendously and beautifully- I’ve changed as a person for the better and I’m not in a self destructive state with a better mental health, attempted eating habits, and knowing my limits and self care despite maybe needing asd diagnosis test and an adhd one. 

I now know not to put myself through self sacrifice to help others due to parental trauma and I’ve learned not to beg for love that’ll never return to me from my parents but that’s still a work in process. I’ll eventually seek therapy again for my health but for the time being, I am proud to say- I’m turning into an adult soon. I had matured too early due to absent parenting but that will heal someday. That concludes everything, my promise to not self destruct to my friend ends tonight but I’ll always keep that promise to my heart for the rest of my life.

Is it possible that you get dumber after being in a long period of acute depression/bad mental state?,101,1.0,"(I apologize for the wording of the question and the choice of words that I made in the post)

I went through a period where I was at an all times low in my life in every way imaginable. For 2 years straight I suffered so badly from depression that I had to quit my job, and university, I shunned all my friends and fought constantly with my family, and my physical health declined so badly that I am battling level 1 hypertension and have gone half bald at 24. It led me to attempt to end my life 4 times and I had (what I assume to be) multiple episodes of psychosis. I am now in a relatively better place (I am back in university and am becoming social slowly). The problem is, I can't do any of the things I used to do.

I used to be great with art, I drew, painted, wrote in my spare time, and even worked as a fashion designer. Now I can't draw a straight line to save my life. I also used to love to go on hikes, ride my bike, and go swimming. I can't do any of it, despite being trained and playing in my school's swimming team from when I was 8 until I was 16.

One of my friends has a history of battling depression and anxiety (and have attempted multiple time in the past). She also lost some function until she started going to a psychiatrist and therapist. I didn't have professional help and tried therapy for months but it didn't do much.

With that being said, what's your experience with regression after depression? Do you think people get ""dumber"" or lose mental/motor functions after being in a long period of depression? Or is that limited to the ones that don't receive professional help? Is it possible to gain back those skills as good as they were by pushing through the mental block?

What the movies don’t tell you about trauma,99,0.96,"I’m rewatching that scene from the last of us where the main character endured something horrible and she was scared and crying and her father figure calms her down and just holds her and called her his baby girl like he called his own daughter.

And I think that’s why people romanticize trauma so much.

I feel like people just don't care,96,0.95,"Today I was just completely depressed. This has been going on for the last week, and I wonder does anyone give a shit how I feel. No one really talks to me unless they have to (ie. They only want something). People at my job can just talk to others like its just a normal thing, where I can't even get anyone to talk to me. Throughout my life I've always felt like a lone person socially, but I haven't felt this way in a long time. Sometimes I want to know if I just unalive myself will anyone really care. I guess the only reason I haven't yet is because of my daughter. I don't want to make her go through the pain of losing her dad. 

The statistics for middle age men who unalive themselves are pretty high, and for them who have gone through so much shit up until that point its quite obvious why. People like myself who are introverted with little to no social skills and live a life with little to no social interactions really don't have that much to live for. And for people who say its not too late to learn such skills at a latet age, while true but knowing you will forever play catch up just makes life completely discouraging.

Yeah my wife wants to leave me,98,0.98,"I found a letter she wrote that she intended to give to me tomorrow. I was by myself, alone and my house. My wife had left for something I wasn’t invited to and I happened across the letter. 

Basically the whole thing boils down to she thinks I’m unhappy in our marriage, she says she’s unhappy with our marriage and wants to begin the process for divorce.

This shattered me to a million pieces.lately I’ve been dealing with more stress and anxiety than I ever have and finding that letter broke me.

I told her I found the letter and I had left one of my own explaining the mental health issues I’ve been dealing with, apologizing for her being drawn into it and for all the times I tried to cope in an unhealthy way.

my wife is going to tell me she wants a divorce. I do not want a divorce.

Tomorrow is going to be an extremely difficult day for me  (or today at this point by now)

I’ve seen the writing on the wall, I haven’t been the husband she deserves for a multitude of reasons but, she’s been the wife I’ve needed to keep me under control.

I don’t want to lose my wife. I wrote a letter for her explaining in excruciating detail that I’ve been dealing with mental health issues that have otherwise left me failing as a proper husband and consistently letting her down and breaking promises (not in spite of her) 

I know what’s coming and I dread it more than anything I ever have before. Tomorrow is judgement day it would seem and I’m worried about how I’m going to manage without her should she ultimately decide to leave.

I have no intention of forcing her to stay in a marriage she is unhappy in, I just feel like we’ve never really tried to make things work and I want to at the very least try.

We’re going to talk tomorrow about how we are going to proceed and I really just need some support.

I don’t know what her absolute decision will be but based on what I read, she has been done with this marriage for long time

I still love her, she is the only reason I have a degree and a job related to the degree I obtained.

This past March was our 5th year wedding anniversary, I did not anticipate that it could be our last. 

I’ve been stuck in a dark place for the past few weeks and I don’t want to lose my wife.

She seems to think we’ve been living a loveless marriage, which I will accept blame for not fulfilling my end of the intimacy aspect of the relationship. I don’t meant to imply this is entirely my fault however I do accept that in my imperfect actions as a husband also contributed to this situation.

My wife seems to think I don’t love her. I do, more than I could ever explain.

I travel frequently for work and I feel like this has not only contributed to the strife in my marriage but also driven me to the brink of insanity.

I took the job because it was the best offer after I a graduated and I thought it would be in both of our interests for me to take it as it was a significant pay increase compared to what I was making. (I did not make this decision without her)

I think this job has contributed to the downfall of the relationship between my wife and myself.

These next few days are going to be very hard for me, I feel like I’ve matured 10 years over the span of a week, the stress and anxiety have been unbearable. 

I don’t want to lose my wife, she is the light in my life but, I’m not going to try to force her to stay in a marriage that she does not think she can be happy in.

It’s rough, guys and I am not looking forward to our conversation but, I need to find closure one way or the other or I’m going to lose my mind.



***********************UPDATE************************

I have just reopened Reddit since posting this. There are a lot of comments and I will get around to answering those of you I am able to as I am able to.

Just as a little general answer as to how things are at the moment: 

I’ve found peace in this situation and have been preparing myself for whatever the final outcome of my marriage is.

I’ve been staying with my parents for a week, I’ve been getting counseling, I was started in an antidepressant and right now I’m going through the wonderful effects that starting an antidepressant brings.

My wife and I are separating for a year, she is taking our dog and will be living in Iowa with her grandmother for the next year until she has to return for school.

I feel like I’m starting to come out of a lifetime of being on autopilot and feel hope for my future for the first time in years.

That’s all I can think of for now, heads a little fuzzy because of antidepressant but overall mental health is looking up at the moment.

I was sexually abused as a boy,94,0.97,"Well, that's the first time I talk about it at all. I'm 20 now and I suffered abuse since I cannot remember until I was 11. It took a long time to realize what happened to me was wrong and a longer time to realize I was not the wrong side. Until this, how I say, my mind was a straight up hell.

&#x200B;

I was a shy and isolated child. I actually talked a lot with my close ones, but introvert at all, nothing wrong. I remember when I was around 5, my grandmother told me to lie down with her in the bed. I refused at first, but she insisted so much that I accepted. She then started to talk about things involving sexual organs and how it was important to me to know the female body(remembering, I was 5). She asked me if I had ever seen a woman naked, so I told something like ""I've taken showers with my cousin(my age, call her 'Ana')"". Then she literally pulled down her pants and asked me to touch it, to ""know how it is"". I remember feeling very embarrassed and uncomfortable, and she said something like ""you have not to feel any wrong with this, it's like your cousin, but bigger"". Fucked up.

&#x200B;

Later, when I was 7-8, I was pretty often in her house, since my parents worked the whole day. So I often ate, took showers and slept there. Just to say, Some nights I couldn't sleep because that bedroom made me terrified(I actually didn't know why at this time). My younger brother and cousin(male) also were often there. At this age, she put us together in bath and, honestly, nothing inappropriated ever happened during these times. For some reason, the disturbing things happened only when we were alone, and she developed some creepy obsession with me, I will explain later.

&#x200B;

She had one of those electric massage tools, you know. She liked to massage my body with that, and I liked it in the beggining. She massaged my shouders, arms and feet, and that felt really good. But with time, she started to spend more and more time putting that thing over my chest and legs, until she put it over my genitals. I think that was my first orgasm, because the feeling was so intense and unexpected(also my body was probably aroused by the preliminary contact, but I couldn't know what is was). I had never experienced an erection at this time, but even so my genitals were ""wet"" when I went to bathroom. She made it more times, but not so intense, she kinda passed the tool around my legs and stomach and sometimes put it over the genitals, for a little time. She always told me I was her favourite grandchild, the most handsome, and other kinds of praises that made me feel disgusting.

&#x200B;

Sadly, the signs of abuse started to appear at that time. I became more introvert in school and, sometimes, I really froze when talking to people, and couldn't make many friends. I became aroused too. I felt I had the need of masturbate, not periodically because it felt good, but almost every day led by pure anxiety and that felling that it's the only way you were taught to do. fortunately, I never extended this to other people, but always kept it to myself(actually it fucked my mental health, but I honestly prefer this than become an abuser and victimizing and hurt other people). I remember taking baths with my cousin(yeah, that one I told in the bed) at my 9-10 and I never made any sexual play or talk with her. I only had a bit of curiosity about her vagina(also she about my penis), but those thoughts faded away when we started playing of throwing water at each other and make silly beards with foam. Those are actually good memories, which is kinda ironical in my opinion.

&#x200B;

So I hit puberty. I was 11 and, for privacy reasons, I told her I didn't want to take my baths with cousins or brothers. Anyways, she was until in the bedroom(there were a bedroom and bathroom, no door between them) and it was not a problem at all, I've taken many baths with she watching before. One day, After I finished the bath, I got up to shower the foam off and asked her for the towel. I always made this, but that time, well, I had an erection. Not first time, but first in front of someone. Well, she basically touched me very inapropriately, not going to give details here.

&#x200B;

I took baths there only a few times more, until I stopped totally to go there and stayed alone in home. In these days before I took this decision, her obsession about me and my body became sick. when I was in the bathroom, she started to massage my body and making awful comments about my penis. Yeah, some sick things like ""how can something be so thick, do you do exercises for it to grow?"", ""the girls will be crazy when you put this in front of them"" and ""your girlfriend will be a very happy girl with this"". Sorry for the girls reading this. Uh, my parts are actually very normal, and it's not a problem to me. I really care way more about feelings and caring than the body, and I'm pretty sure I could only stay with a girl if she felt the same. But now I know that she was doing had never to do with caring or increasing my self steem, but some distrubing way to catch me psychologically.

&#x200B;

Still in this bath part, she touched me very times, in the whole body. One day she took my phone that I had left in my pants and started reading my personal messages. There was really nothing I should be worried about, but it made me very uncomfortable too. Another day, after I took my clothes off, she said me to wait because she wanted to take a bath first. So she undressed in front of me and I obviously had an erection. She didn't touch me but I could see by her face that she was very satisfied producing that. That day was the more disturbing. After she finished, she told me to get in(She got out and dressed first, fortunately) and take my turn. I did, and when I get out, she told me to lie down in the bed, because she had noticed I had ""a rash on my inner thighs"" and she needed to see it. I honestly cannot describe what I was feeling. A mix of anxiety, fear, and somehow, arousal. When she pulled my towel off, I had a full erection. She put an oinment in my thighs and then started with that twisted comments about my body, penis and girls. So she put an oil in her hands and started, you know what. It may feel disturbing, but she moved her hands so passionately over my testicles and penis that it really looked like she was pleasing herself. I knew I should stop that, I should run away and tell someone, but at that time I felt so, uh, horny maybe, that I just couldn't stop it. I feel it extremely disgusting, but I think whoever experienced an orgasm knows exactly what I'm talking about. Well, then I came in her hands and that was the last time I went there.

&#x200B;

The last part was the worst of all, no doubts. I was in later middle school and I had always got the best grades in every subject, but my grades ""suddenly"" decreased to hell. To worsen the situation, my math teacher was very harsh and blamed me everytime for getting bad grades. I stopped doing things I liked before and lost 30kg (66 pound) in a very short time. I got also kind of addicted to porn, since it was the only thing that could distract me even for a few minutes. The rest of the time was pure torment in my head. I also had nocturnal panic and some weird things like imagining that there were demons or monsters in my bedroom. My family is evangelical, and it didn't help me much. Everytime I went to the church, I could feel anything but shame and guilt, feeling as I was not worth of being there. And, since I had not friends or someone I could trust to open myself, I always ended up believing those thoughs were true.

&#x200B;

When I was to get into middle school, I moved to other school. It's not necessary to say that my mind was not healthy and I couldn't make lasting relationship bonds. I was getting good grades again, but no one of my friends of that time remains close to me today, except by that cousin, Ana, who studied with me in high school. We had a good friendship, and our talks are almost always about music, school and politics. Since we are relatives and were very close in childhood, she felt ok to talk about sex with me sometimes, but always in a respectful way. Her concerns were most about having sex before marriage, and I said her if she wanted to be with her boyfriend for life and both felt ok with that, it shouldn't there be any problem(she's with the same guy until today and they are happy, I feel really glad for her). Today she's in 2nd year to become a psychologist. Sometimes I think about talking these things with her, but I really don't feel secure to open up.

&#x200B;

In my last year in middle school, I got really depressed. I lost my will to live and have a future, I didn't got into college and abandoned all my social circle. The only thing I did in this time was work, go to church and sleep. Despite my shame feelings never left, I always prayed to God to help me, at least, don't give up on everything. I think I'm doing well actually. 

&#x200B;

In my 19, I took my drive license. I thought I wouldn't be able to do it, due to my high anxiety level and a almost constant headache I have, but I did and I drive pretty well. I am also going to do exams to get into a college the next week. I'm not full confident that I will pass but I promised to not desperate and try again next year if I fail. I also found a girl that became one of the most important parts of my life. We are not in love yet, but I can feel she likes me the same way I like her. She laughs at all my jokes and pay attention when I'm talking, and it really makes a great difference. I don't struggle with thoughts like ""if I had found someone like her before I could have avoided a lot of suffering"" because I know that find someone like her is very rare and, anyways, she turns my days way lighter and brighter, and hard things have become easier to do. My greatest fear was how my body would react when we got close. I'm not talking about sex, and I don't want to think about it until the marriage(we're both evangelicals so it's ok), but normal physical contact. Fortunately, I discovered that I like her touch, and stay close feels very confortable, like the opposite I used to feel. I'm not gonna lie, I still have nightmares, flashbacks and panic, I still struggle with porn sometimes(very very few times, but when it happens I feel like those days), but I'm doing my best. When I feel depressed, it's like the time around me had stopped and I don't have forces to do anything, but I'm taking less time to recover than in other times. I've made good friends in the church and work, and the familiy of my girl is like a second family for me. Well, today my life is divided by fews days when I feel absolutely hopeless and some days when I have force, even feeling bad, shameful and empty I can do my best to have a future when I'll be free of this.

&#x200B;

PS: if someone is worried about my brother and cousins, they are all well. I really don't believe they went through this things, I've always kept an eye over all of them to not let the same thing that happened to me happen to them, and they are all ok, both physical and mentally.

you think about your feelings, things you did, words you said, your purpose, your values, your inner world in general. you think about people around, your relationship with them, their attitude towards you.   
you're constanly analyzing and trying to improve and become a better person.   


that's why you find yourself sad and depressed in the process, self-improvement and desire to change things will inevitably lead to that.

most people just don't care, they don't notice things like you do, they don't analyze, they don't search for answers, they don't want to improve and become better.

FUCK I’m panicking I don’t know what to do.

I’m 17m and autistic and in the last few weeks my life has gotten worse and worse.

I went from having an unreliable therapist to NO THERAPIST. I DONT KNOW WHAT IM GOING TO DO. I LITERALLY HAVE NO THERAPY AND WONT HAVE ANY SUPPORT.

I just got referred to adult mental health services but that isn’t gonna be available until at LEAST April 2024.

My face feels numb. My entire body is shaking. I feel like I want to throw up. Oh fuck this feels so bad. It’s 7am and I haven’t slept at all. 

My knuckles have just scarred since I last had a meltdown and stupidly punched a wall, and all I want to do is punch another one. 

I’ve been having a panic attack for the last 2 hours. I feel like I’m dying. I cannot stop thinking of hurting myself. I’m too scared to be hospitalised and how that would affect my already shit home life.

This literally is a nightmare. I am in agony. This is hell. My friends are smart and talented and going off to uni next year. They can’t help me, my family can’t help me, I am literally trapped.

I was beat with anything within reach and when I finally found someone who loved me I was punished for it. I don’t know. I need help.

How to break contact with suicidal friend?,92,0.97,"I (23F) met Anna (19F) in a psychiatric hospital six months ago. We quickly became friends and after our release we stayed in contact and met up a few times. She is very suicidal, self-harms and has other issues too. She would often text me that she was about to commit suicide/had already done something harmful, and each time i was worried and scarred, kept messaging and calling her. I told her to go back to the hospital, she finally did a month ago but left after a few weeks. Today she texted me saying she was afraid she her father would die because she put a bunch of painkillers into his drink after he got physical in a fight and now he was out cold. I begged her to call an ambulance. I didn't know what to do, if i called them and told the truth she would probably get arrestes. Finally i got her to call an ambulance, and her dad is okay, she didn't put too much. But the fear i was in while i was waiting for her to text back was terrible. My own mental health isn't the best and it spirals each time something like this happens. I deeply care about her, but i feel like i can't do this anymore.

Why can’t I do what normal people do?,91,0.98,"I have a list of mental disorders. No matter how I treat them or how much time has passed, they’re still there. They always will be. 

The thing is, people don’t care.

The company holding my student loans doesn’t care that I had a mental breakdown and was never able to finish college to get a job that pays well enough to pay them.

My landlord doesn’t care if I can’t pay rent because I can’t keep a job when my stress and anxiety make me miss too many days. 

The insurance company doesn’t care if an expensive drug might help with my conditions. 

The government worker doesn’t care if I can’t qualify for assistance. I’m just another number in their system.

The judge didn’t care when I went in front of them to try to get disability. My condition wasn’t visible enough to match the information from my doctors.

My friends didn’t care if I couldn’t handle socializing for long periods of time. They just moved on. 

My partner doesn’t care if I can’t work up what’s needed to do the dishes today. They need to get done.

I don’t understand why there are all these mental roadblocks in the way to having a normal life. I should be able to be normal. Why can’t I do what normal people do?

"Today, a random man saved my life.",92,0.98,"The last few years have been escalating and escalating.

I berated myself for not being where I wanted to be. I blamed myself for every single failure, and couldn't see a way out. I pretended, I masked, until I allowed it to continue spiralling to this point. I spent months in utter silence, rejecting any support thrown my way.  

Today, an academic advisor from my university did not show up to a very important meeting which I barely managed to fit in before my deadline. I was at a breaking point, feeling that I somehow just needed to summon every last bit of energy in myself to deal with the irritating and never-ending minute problems of every single day. All these minute things had become far more important than anything else.

So, this happy, queer, and relatably autistic and disorganised man I already vaguely knew took me in instead. I'd seen him before, he had forgotten something he needed to submit from me, some silly admin thing. We had laughed about the fact that two severely ADD people would forget about this tiny thing months and months on end, having the same conversation every 6 months when the dread would pop back in our minds. 

Today, he took me in. Nonchalantly, the busiest man I know just went ""Since you're already here, come in! No problem."" 

He not only heard me, but he told me exactly what I needed to hear, and he probably has absolutely no idea. I know he saw me. He never blamed me, he never made me feel ashamed of myself. In the few minutes after he had noticed that I was sitting outside an empty office with my advisor missing, he already went to find all information he could on me so that he could give me the best advice. He told me I mattered, he told me I belonged, and he gave me the one thing I felt I had lost; he reminded me that I do have control over my life. I can decide where I go. It doesn't matter that my path doesn't look the way I thought it 'should' (whatever that means), and that it doesn't look the way my peers' do. 

Leaving that office, after a mere thirty minute conversation with him, I walked 2 hours before coming home, before sitting and writing a thank you to him, and before realising that he had just saved my life. 

You have nothing to lose by knocking on doors when you need it. Do not underestimate what help can do for you, no matter the scale of it. That's it; this nice friendly academic advisor.

I can't stop thinking about my brother,91,0.97,"Hi everyone.  
What I’m about to write will probably be super confusing, disgusting, and weird. But, I have no one I can tell and so, I’m here on Reddit telling strangers. 

  
My(21) brother(19) is always doing explicit sexual things in front of me. Not entirely explicit, but explicit enough. He likes to go around the house naked. He comes in my room and stands by my bed and waves his dick at me. He asks me if I want to suck it. He comes in my room in the morning with morningwood and in his underwear. At random times, he’ll come in my room gully dressed, but grabbing is crotch and asking me to stroke it through his jeans. He always comments on my body and always tries and sometimes does grab my butt. He says, word for word “You have such a fucking juicy ass” “Get on the bed” “I’m gonna fuck you”. He moans our names and will randomly be sitting their and moans “oh oh I’m gonna cum”.

  
There’s so much more but in the moment I can’t remember.

  
Now I know, the simple solution to this would be to lock my door. But he will break down my door.   
Or I could tell my parents, but they already know and they don’t care. They say “he’s crazy, there’s nothing we can do about it”. They don’t understand that my brothers actions are effecting me mentally. Another solution would be for me to move out. But, I love my mom and if I left, my dad and his family would emotionally and mentally abuse my mom. Which is not something I would like. However this is probably what I will do in the near future.

  
I’m not here really looking for a solution though. Especially since I do plan on moving out in a year after saving some more money. I’m here just to put how I feel into words, especially in regards to how it is effecting me. I didn’t realize just how badly my brother doing this was a effecting me until recently. I’m an avid romance novel reader. However, I can not get through the romantic/explicit scenes in books anymore. My brother keeps popping up in my mind and I immediately have to close the book. I can’t even masturbate without his image. And it turns me off. I don’t think I can even have someone touch me or hear sexual words without my brothers face coming in my mind. 

  
It’s killing me on the inside and I don’t know what to do. It’s disgusting and I’m trying so hard to block it out, but I can’t. I just want to have fun, live life, read a damn romance book in peace, but I can’t.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that I am female, as some people are wondering. Also, it seems like people think that this post is some sort of incest porn fantasy. Which to me, sounds outrageous and honestly pretty hurtful and it seems like people are trying to invalidate what goes on in my life. But this is my reality. I find my brother absolutely disgusting, however, I huge part of me feels helpless.

I'm a 30yo M that has been going through depression for 10+ years aswell as chronic back pain for the same amount. I've been trying multiple pain meds and depression meds that have not helped, though I've learned to manage the pain without meds. 

The issue is, that I've been noticing a slow but steady deterioration of my mental sharpness, I don't feel as mental sharp, feels like a slog to come up with ideas or even basic things.. like coming up with conversation topics or keeping up with conversations. I have EXTREME short term memory loss, sometimes I bring myself a glass of water and can't even remember going to get it.. or remembering what I just said in a span of 5 mins. I also have a tough time recollecting broad information. At the start, when it was milder, I thought it was a normal aging process, but as I got worse I couldnt help but think there was something more going on and Im extremely worried this will only get worse with time. Brain fog and feeling stupid most of the time.. and while I don't want to make myself seem full of myself, but I felt I was an extremely smart and sharp kid. I can barely recognize myself

Has anybody faced these issues? Is there any hope to get better in this facet? Is there any other conditions I should be looking at?

"My therapist made a racial comment. Im desperate for therapy, but think I should cut her loose. Am I overreacting?",84,0.92,"I just started therapy again, and have had 3 sessions with a therapist. I am a Black female and my therapist is a Black female.

We were discussing something related to germs. I can sometimes be “overly clean” and a bit of a “clean freak” which sometimes crosses the line into unhealthy and causes me anxiety. 

My fiancé is a white male. And although I don’t recall exactly what was said before my therapist  made the racial comment, I think i was   talking to her about how when we go to our Friends’ houses I often get picky about what I eat, drink out of etc.

Anyway, I forget what was said directly before she made this statement, but at one point my therapist said:  “Well, you know White people can be a little …..” . And  either she finished the sentence with “not that clean” OR, she made a face suggesting unclean. I honestly can’t remember, but her tone and body language made it very clear what she was suggesting. She was assuming it was a white person’s house and was essentially saying “Well maybe you being picky about those things is justified since white people can be a little nasty.” 

People are very comfortable talking to me, and in this case I think she got waaaaay too comfortable and slipped and shared this thought/bias like I’m just one of her friends.

I honestly  don’t think she is racist or meant any harm, BUT the comment was troublesome(for my reasons below) and I don’t think I want to work with her anymore. But I really need therapy. Should I stay or get on the hunt for someone else? 

 My issues:
1.) Therapist are humans and yes have their own biases and stereotypes, but when you’re in sessions it’s your job to remain unbiased and not speak on racial stereotypes

Traumatized by being tasered and handcuffed by police during wellness check,87,0.97,"Has anyone else ever been apprehended by police or had force used on them during a mental health situation and if if you have how do you cope with it? If you haven’t, what do you think about this and would you cope?

So a few months ago I called 911 because I felt like self harming. First I actually called something called here 24/7 which a mental health hotline and they told me if I want to self harm then I should probably call the police. 

My partner was with me and called with me and we both told the 911 dispatch I was feeling like self harming and I had a small kitchen knife to my thigh but I didn’t cut yet.

I told the 911 dispatch I was afraid the police would hurt me because I know they are aggressive sometimes and I work for the newspaper so I hear about what happens. She reassured me that are coming to “help” and I’ve had the police called by neighbours for arguments between my bf and I before and usually they’ve somewhat helpful, one time they even brought a mental health counsellor so I thought it would be like that. I just wanted some intervention to help me get out of that crazy head space.

So when the police came barging in they were screaming drop the knife (I was holding it to my leg lol) and I said no ONCE before I could even look up they tasered me. They had a riot shield, a gun and a taser pointed me at me when they came barging in screaming at me. Mind you, this is Canada.

The police officer who tasered me kept apologizing and saying to my bf “my friend just died like this and I panicked” or some shit. Like wow. The female cop there and the EMS told me there is usually a lot of deescalation tactics before that like they try to talk you down and stuff but they didn’t and they usually ever use force if they feel in danger. They told me to file a report against them because it was  very abnormal and they felt sorry for me. Imagine. 

They told me to and my mom told me to file a report and even get a lawyer because guess what when I got to the hospital they told me the police wrote on the report I said I “wanted to die by suicide by police” like yoooo I said the complete opposite to the dispatcher!!! I was AFRAID of them hurting me. I would never ever say something so foolish and I am NOT suicidal. So, they told me I should clear my name because it’s not safe or good at all to have that on my file and next time something happens they’ll be even more aggressive.

But I didn’t wanna relive the trauma so I didn’t (stupid) and fast forward to this week a neighbour called cause my bf and I got into a huge fight and I had a mark on my head cause I self harmed by hitting my head against the wall. They asked me and him if I was suicidal and we both said no not at all. They didn’t even ask me to go with them in the ambulance like usual for the mandatory mental health check, the paramedics came and asked me if I wanted to get my HEAD looked at and I said no. The police said ONCE “you’re going to the hospital for a check” and I was holding my cat in my arms and said “I don’t want to though” once and they literally attacked me so fast twisted my arms so aggressively and handcuffed me. I was crying yelling like WTF I WILL GO VOLUNTARILY U DONT NEED TO HANDCUFF ME UR HURTING ME. It was horrible they hurt me so much and dragged me like an animal when I kept saying unhandcuff me I will go voluntarily….if I had known they were gonna do that I obviously would’ve just went. Why would I want to be handcuffed and treated like that? I’m not that crazy.

I was at the hospital for 10 hours alone with no phone waiting to be discharged bc there was only 1 ER doctor and my bf “couldn’t handle being there and needed space” or some shit.

I *think* I have trauma due to movies my father puts on,85,0.83,"TRIGGER WARNING: MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FEARS 

I don’t want to use the word trauma incorrectly but I said it because I feel like I have symptoms of it.

The story is that since I was around 12, my dad would put on movies that involved women being sexually assaulted and abused. They bothered me but they didn’t horrify me as much as when I was 16. That year my dad put on two movies called “Hollow Man” and “Sleepers” which are also movies that also featured sexual assault but for some reason these movies made me cry the most and still scares me to this day (I’m 19 going onto 20 now). The scenes of these movies essentially come back to my memory randomly if I get too deep in my thoughts and it rattles me. It’s been so bad that the horror even affects me when I am in public. I feel uncomfortable when people look at me and I worry they may try to hurt me or even my loved ones. The thoughts of the scenes and the idea of people hurting me and loved ones like that plague me more now that I am studying so much and sleeping less. It also makes me anxious whenever my father puts on a movie to the point I google the plot to mentally prepare. I tend to watch kids movies because I know that will be safe.

However, I am becoming older and will soon have to have my own life outside of my parents so I am more afraid of stepping into this scary world myself.

I think I’m being emotionally abused and I don’t know what to do,83,0.98,"I’m 35F and have been married for a decade now. I’m Indian and this is an arranged marriage.

Within 3 months of my marriage, my husband got to know of a past relationship of mine, something I hadn’t shared with him. I was no longer in touch with my x and it seemed pretty pointless bringing him up. But this was something he was (and still is) unable to overlook. He made me call my parents, my brother and threatened to divorce me, leaving everyone in a bad spot within our community.

Of course, the divorce didn’t happen, but thus began the unending emotional abuse. From gaslighting, twisting my words, to blaming me for his depression (since knowing your wife has an x is valid grounds for depression) he covered the entire nine yards. 

Things got better late 2021, I’m not entirely sure why. I think it was because thanks to Covid, we were forced to wfh, be with each other for hours on end. He possibly saw me for the person I am - and not what he made presumed I’ll be.

Flash forward to today. Last night, he wanted to get intimate. But having worked 12 hours at a high stress job, plus the extra effort to take care of his parents (who are currently visiting us), my cup was empty. Come this morning and he vehemently said - “I cannot continue to stay married to you. I feel disrespected. My parents are here, I’ll share all the truth about your past and divorce you.” That’s always the sword he’s wielding at me. 

Additionally, he blamed me for everything that went wrong with him - a mediocre rise in his career (he has my dream career, I don’t know why he complains), his heart problem (the tests that I pushed him to get - they came back normal), his weight gain, everything.

I can’t divorce him, that’ll be cruel to my parents and my 7yo. I feel enough of my dignity has been eroded by him, little by little, over the past decade.

I'm kind of pissed at basically everyone in my life at the moment, even at my own crush whom I perceive as a kind of savior (to whom I normally send my nudes). What should I do to release this tension BUT in a safe way?    
(I did ""share"" my nudes to two strangers previously -- regretted it afterward, felt unsafe)

Edit: STOP DM-ing FOR NUDES!!!!!! I’m gonna block y’all

———————————————————————————
ADDITIONAL EDIT: just wanna give a few updates from after talking to my therapist and after reading some of your suggestions too. (I haven’t read all of them esp the very recent ones—was planning to reply to them, but I’m losing all my energy now as it’s 3 AM here already in my place). A little TMI, I’m also diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder.

Here’s what my therapist said: [ … You can send it to your friends, or post in anonymous Twitter account with 0 follower. You can take as many as you can (to get you distracted) then back it up on your Cloud/Drive account. Send it to yourself is also another alternative. Make sure those photos do not feature your face. Better yet, keep your phone under lock & key and only retrieve it when you are calmed down. Hope it helps. You got this! ]

What I did by far:
1. Creating a spare insta account with 0 followers, started by uploading my normal, non-nudes selfies, ended up not sending nudes at all because I was too busy looking at my selfies and uploading them right before I got to open my hidden nudes folder haha (sorry if it sounds too cringeworthy—kinda feel cute these days). 

2. Impulsively uploaded normal, proper selfies to a subreddit and somehow felt better about it (except for some of the disgusting DMs part). Hope it doesn’t sound narcissistic but, it felt good looking at the number of DM requests though I didn’t reply to them [BUT I truly don’t appreciate some of the DMs coming from this particular post from r/mentalhealth because, apparently, those people intentionally take advantage of me and no, I don’t reply to them :)]

3. Talked to someone, felt good. Made up with my crush, had a good talk with him and he said sorry for not being there for me for the past few days. Had a video call with him as well.

After (1) and (2) I felt calmer, and after (3) I felt amazing.

WHY I TRY HARD NOT TO POST MY NUDES:

[I saw some of you suggesting me to post on Reddit with a throwaway account without my face on, or creating an OF account, or sending it to friends.]

Why I clearly avoid doing that: as weird as it may sound, I’m actually just trying to honor my idealistic principle of thinking that nudes = exclusive, I particularly take them for someone special and send them only to that particular person.

When I said I wanted to send nudes this morning I didn’t take anything new—I was about to send my old nudes from a few months ago. Which was taken for my crush.

In my previous experience, I had to send my nudes at least to 2 or 3 people not out of my will, I just kinda got “groomed” onto it or because I couldn’t clearly say no—only to regret it afterwards. Wasn’t even thinking of my own safety at the time, I was solely disappointed at how I “betrayed” my own principle (NOT betraying my crush, since I’m not yet exclusively in a committed relationship with him anyway). Yeah I’m idealistic AF.

And this I guess is my very first time, for whatever reason (seeking validation? Wanting some tension? Not sure, I guess the first one) I want to share my nudes when (presumably) I’m about to enter my hypomanic episode (in my previous hypomanic episode I was about to fuck random ass dudes, thank god I canceled the plan).

"is it OK for a father to slap his
daughter's ass as a joke?",80,0.84,"I'm a 20 years old only child, and my father has always been like this. I remember he'd try to kiss me on the lips when I was 7-10. When I got older, I began refusing because I understood that it's not a normal thing that fathers do with their daughters. He's also touched me inappropriately a lot of times. Every single day, he wants a hug and a kiss and gets mad at me whenever I refuse. He also keeps asking me to sit on his lap. 

It makes me extremely uncomfortable. Is it normal, or am I just overreacting as he claims? He says that it's him being ""affectionate."" 

He'd also sexually assaulted me by, it's so disgusting that I don't even wanna type it out, but, licking my nipples when i was 8 and asking me to touch his yk what. My grandfather - his father - has also done this to me, but I stopped seeing him after I turned 10. He even almost forced me to touch him in the middle of the street until I screamed and he let go of me. Neither of them knows what the other one did, but I guess it does come by genes.

My parents divorced when I was around 10-12, but it wasn't for this reason.

Why does this happen to me? Why couldn't I have a normal family? Now I'm 20, I've never had a boyfriend because talking to guys makes me uncomfortable and every single time a guy is acting nice towards me my daddy issues start acting up and I feel like he's trying to get something from me. I'm so desperate for a relationship at this point, but I'm also too scared to commit to one. 

And the worst thing is that even tho he's done unspeakable things to me, I still want to give him a chance and forgive him. He wasn't a bad father besides being a pedophile. And I hate myself for it, but I just want my dad to be my dad. It's not a surprise if i confess that i feel attracted towards older men than guys my age, and it disgusts me. I keep searching for a father figure in every single man that I meet. Whether it's my teacher or a bus driver. But deep down, I know that the only man a girl could trust with her life is her father. But who is it in my case?...

Broken man biking across Canada-Update,77,0.99,"Quick who am I. 
I am a 320lb man suffering from severe depression and other mental/physical issues and a month ago I decided to jump on my bike and pedal my ass across the Country. Well, almost across. Moncton NB to Vancouver. 

I'm unsure how to link previous posts maybe someone could be so kind to do that for me in the comments? Or just go to my profile if you're interested in reading more. 


***TRIGGER WARNING***
These updates are raw and real and I talk openly about my struggles with depression but also how Cycling effects those struggles. 


What is a 40lb update you may ask? It's the amount of weight I have lost in 4 weeks. 

When I left Moncton I was 320. I weighed myself yesterday and was 279. 

My jaw dropped. I knew I lost weight, I could see it and feel it. But forty fucking pounds?? 

I was with a host, my first host on this trip and he and his wife were so kind and so accommodating, I truly will remember them both for the rest of my days. It humbles me and as he seen first hand, I'm a very emotional dude. Depression has broken me, but their kindness broke me too and what they did for me will only fuel the fire that under me right now. 

But 40lbs!!! 

When I set out to do this the goal, as you may all remember, was to end up in BC a different and a better man.  A strong man both in body and mind and I can see and feel the changes now just a month in. 

There was a moment when I thought this was having zero positive effect on my mental health, but I was wrong. Everything that could go wrong had gone wrong and yet I still wake up each morning and head west. The other day I found out my EI claim was denied, I went into the bush and sat there thinking this was it. I formulated a plan in my head. Simple, quick, painless. Like I've thought about a million times, except this time for the first time the darkness passed in minutes and not hours or days. 

Imagine being in a dark room, it's pitch black, scary and noisy. Usually after hours or days i just find myself standing outside that room. I don't know I got there but I'm there. Outside the darkness and the noise and I carry on with my day. 

This time was different. As I was sitting there in that dark room the noise was being drown out by thoughts of and the feelings of energy and enthusiasm and excitement. I cannot explain why or how this happened, it's never happened to me before, but I found myself in my head with my thoughts being able to feel the positivity and, well, the light. 

I was outside of that dark room but after minutes and not only did I find myself outside of the room I was running from it, the energy I felt was like poitive emotions at war with the dark and destroying them so fast. 

I called my sister and told her I'm continuing, this can still happen. The world is changing around me, I am changing. I can do this. 


It feels like I should not be surprised by this but since that day the world has given me my two new friends in Ottawa who filled my bags with food (my gracious hosts) its given me a new supporter who just so happens to work with MEC (huge outdoor supply store in Canada) and had offered to help with gear, bike repairs, solar charger, ect. across Canada and has continued to give me an amazingly supportive community via reddit and Insta who message and share and even donate. 

This trip is me getting my self in order, becoming a better man so I can then advocate for other Wards of the Court who are like me, broken and lost. 

This journey has shown me that despite the darkness the world brings, there's always light around that corner and all I have to do is keep pedaling. 

There are days I don't want to, but I have to. Too much is at stake. 

I'm hitting Ontario today. This is when the real long slog starts. 4-6 weeks before I get to the other side. I'm taking the #11 all the way to the #1 going to put my head down and just pedal.

Struggling with Depression? Don't Forget About Your Dental Health!,79,0.99,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share a reminder about the importance of taking care of your dental health, especially if you're dealing with depression. I know firsthand how easy it is to neglect our oral hygiene when we're feeling down, but trust me, it can have serious consequences.



For years, my depression kept me from properly caring for my teeth. I often relied on sugary snacks or even recreational drugs to cope, which only worsened the situation. Yesterday, I finally went to the dentist after 6 long years, and I was shocked to find out that I have significant gum disease. I could potentially lose my teeth, and the dental fees will take me at least a year to pay off.



If you're reading this and realizing that it's been a while since your last dental visit, and if you have the means to afford a checkup, I urge you to go. Dentists are there to help, and they won't judge you. Trust me, they've seen it all. Taking care of your oral hygiene now can save you from expensive dental procedures and years of pain in the future.



I understand that not everyone can afford dental care, and I apologize for not acknowledging this privilege in my initial post. So, instead, I would like to encourage everyone, regardless of their financial situation, to do what they can for their oral hygiene.

I feel like no one likes me, I get so lonely. I feel like I could disappear from te face of the wart and no one would even notice unless they needed something from me. Because that’s how it feels, like all I do is give and provide and no one appreciates or reciprocates. 

It’s one breakdown after the other and I don’t have anyone I can talk to about it. My “friends” wouldn’t understand or they’d just start treating me weird. It’s such a lonely existence, I don’t really want to be doing this life anymore. I’m scared I’m going to be stuck like this forever, mid twenties and I’m lonelier than ever.

Want to make new friends but I don’t even know how to. I’m socially awkward, even when people are nice to me I don’t know how to react and it makes me feel like I’m creeping them out.

Why I’ll never cry in front of a women again…,76,0.85,"When I was around the age of 13-15 I was going to a middle school event on a Friday night, where there would be a whole bunch of fun activities to do. 
On the way there my mom was driving me and as we got there she decided to tell me that my uncle had actually committed suicide a few weeks ago. Hearing that he passed almost a whole month ago and not being told this really made my heart sink to the bottom of my stomach and the only thing I could respond with was “oh”

Anyways after I was dropped off I was obviously completely confused and upset about the whole situation but I tried to keep myself calm and collected, and went to go find my friends to go hang out with.
Everything was going fine at first, I was distracted by my friends and all of the fun games and activities to do there so it was overall pretty fun.

There was a lazar tag inside of the gym in our school so there was a giant line of people who were waiting to play and me and my big group of friends decided to wait the long line, as time goes on we get to the front of the line but I didn’t realize that I was going to be the only one left out because there were already a few people in front of us that got in before we did and I had to be left out, so I waited for them to get back and I went and sat on the stairs.

As I was left alone with my thoughts I started remembering about my uncle who I had suddenly been informed had committed suicide and I was on the verge of tears so I was trying to hide my face in my knees. 
As I was sitting there with my head down a group of 3 girls had noticed me and came to talk to me (after 10 minutes of me sitting there without anyone talking to me)

Anyways they decided to come up to me and ask if I was okay and for some reason hearing those words just made me absolutely break down into tears and I just sobbed into my knees. I tried to speak up but I was choking up on my own tears which made the one to talk to me look confused.

My sisters mental illness is destroying my home life,72,0.97,"I never post my first time visiting a sub, but I would truly appreciate some genuine kindness and feedback from people. My sister’s mental illness is tearing my family apart and I don’t know what to do. 

Also, just as a disclaimer, as her only brother/sibling, I obviously do care for my sister very much, but she makes it difficult to maintain any kind of positive relationship. I am in no way on here to drag her, and will not be using her name. 

My sister, who is 34 now (4 years older than me), has suffered mental health issues since she was a teenager, but it came to a head her senior year of college. She had a manic episode on Thanksgiving Day of 2010, left campus, passed out on the side of the highway, and wound up in the hands of the highway patrol. I’m still super thankful she had the wherewithal to call them/anyone herself, I hate to think of what could have happened. The details are still pretty sketchy, but are not the important factor. She was never the same, and was almost totally incoherent for a solid month after in the psych ward. She has basically been in and out of psych wards around the state at least 2-4 times a year in the ensuing 13 years since. The original diagnosis was some sort of medical gray area schizo-effective bipolar disorder, but I believe it has evolved into borderline personality disorder. 

She ended up leaving her career over it, and is now disabled. Every year that passes since she started getting her disability checks, her health has gotten steadily worse. On top of the issues I’ve stated, she’s also severely overweight and diabetic, can’t handle her own finances, has had a bunch of issues with her thyroid, and her meds either completely sedate her or throw her into a non stop mania, and she is incapable of functioning for days/weeks at times because of it. 

My parents were totally unprepared for all of this. My sister was an honors student, had all kinds of accomplishments to be proud of in high school, and sort of seemed to have her life planned out when she started college. I know no one does, but no parent is ever ready for something like this to happen, it was and is still pretty traumatic.

My folks still look after her (she has never been able to live on her own) and she puts us all through the wringer daily. I moved back home 2 years ago when I was on some truly hard times. At first it was fine, and I learned to be patient with her. Now her attitude has become so vindictive to the point she assumes we all hate her, and that our own mother has a vendetta out to screw her over. She’s completely delusional about this, and I’ve had some arguments with her over it when my temper boils over. I’m not going to let anyone cuss out either of our parents (in front of me AND them). Our mother is her power of attorney and controls most of her savings at this point. It’s just the way my sis talks about her, you’d think our mother beat the hell out of us as kids or something, it’s some truly nasty shit she says. 

She is struggling now more than I think she ever has, her mania and mood swings are so bad that she’s delusional and angry all the time, every day. It’s getting very hard to keep being patient, and to stay at home through all of this. My parents and I have all agreed that this behavior is making us all miserable and sort of codependent with her suffering. Sister is making all of our home lives very chaotic. I get to hear her screaming or sobbing at the top of her lungs nearly every day, usually directed at me or whoever is home. And I’m not sure she even realizes it or cares how she’s affecting us. In turn it is making me callous to her entire condition. It’s hard enough to even be at home witnessing her being this disrespectful. This means if I’m not working 50-60+ hours a week, I am at home arguing with what’s left of my only sibling and watching her life fall deeper into the shitter. 

Sister is supposed to receive a deal on affordable housing very soon, but we all of course seriously doubt that she will be able to take care of herself. None of us know what to do. We assume she will move out and be back home again within a few months and in even worse shape. And it especially wears down my retired father, who she has been truly awful to in the past few months. 

I guess the point I’m getting at is that I can’t figure out what to do now. I feel like if I move out, I completely waste my opportunity to save loads of cash so that I can buy a home. I have begun saving, and it is quite possible by next spring if I keep working and saving. But if I stay, I also have to keep dealing with this... I think it’s fair to say she will never be “cured,” and that the best she can hope for is that it gets more manageable. That also seems unlikely. 

I went back to online therapy recently, and am considering going back to my old in-person therapist to work out some of these issues and other personal problems I’ve had over the past few years. My sis and my parents have also totally rejected going to family/group therapy whenever I bring it up.

"I’ve cut sugar, porn, video games, alcohol out and still struggle with social paralysis",71,0.92,"I’m a 29 (M) and I’ve never had a girlfriend or wife which causes deep pain.  I’m having a harder night than usual and feel the need to vent.

In the past couple of years, I’ve completely changed certain parts of my life.  I’ve cut out porn, video games, bad food, alcohol, and recently - even sugar.

Something that doesn’t help my situation is I don’t like myself.  I don’t like that I have essential tremors (shakiness) in my hands.  I don’t like that I have some acne on my neck and back.  I don’t like that my personality is not the type that’s the “life of the party” for lack of a better word.  I don’t like that I have some redness in my eyes unless I use special eye drops.

I thought by cutting all of that out, routinely working out, and dressing better - that girls would approach me or show cues that they’re interested in me.

It is fucking hard to swallow the idea that nothing will change unless you basically start immersing yourself in your fears.

I guess this post is not about finding a solution, or finding a “silver bullet”, but I want to vent and maybe hear from people with similar problems.

"I am not proud of my job, ashamed even, I feel like 'less' of a person, and possibly for no reason. How could I get out of this?",70,1.0,"Hi all.

All of my life I had ambition, I wanted to be an artist in video games, I got there but it wasn't quite right. But it was still awesome. It was awesome for 2 years until I was made redundant in the recession. Since then I needed a job, any job, and I landed a job as an artworker. (for artworker think of graphic design, but the difference between a chef and a cook as being the difference between an artworker and a designer)

I like it well enough but all I do is practical problem solve, I don't do anything creative, I do the practical side of the business. So we have a logo that has been updated, it is now my job to get it updated on 10,000 documents. It is challenging sometimes but most of the time I feel like a factory worker. 

The thing is, many would love my job, many would like the simplicity of just doing practical work not creative stuff. 

But I feel ashamed of it. Like I wanted to be an artist, but now I just push buttons, noting unique or creative. Not many designers could do what I do because it would bore them, and they wouldn't think analytically enough to do this kind of work. But they still think they are superior (and have shown it).

A new job sounds like it is the way to go but I have no idea what togo into, and I earn 30k which is kind of where the cut off is, I could be a designer and earn no more. So my wage isn't even bad (no great in a cost of living crisis, but not bad either).

I just don't feel right?

I got divorced last year and it messed my head up, I am so envious of friends who are in the military but I am 35...I can't do that. And I gave up my chance because my ex didn't want me to do it. 

&#x200B;

I just don't like what I do, I feel embarrassed by it. Im not a designer or an artist I am more like a technician at best. I feel like I have up opportunities to do other things because others didnt want em to do that and I put others first naturally. 

It has gotten to a point where I sort of don't even want to open my eyes in the morning. I am ok once i am moving more or less but in the mornings i am bad. On m drive to work today I fleetingly imagined just turning the wheel and going off the side of the road. Just because it would put an end to this monotony. 

I don't want this to be my legacy...making forms for clients...but I don't want to jump just because the grass may be greener. 

I just feel lost. And ever since the divorce I have been feeling worse and worse.

I got fired because of my mental health,70,0.96,"So I only worked at this job for a few months but never called out I have ADHD and depression but I still came in even if my depression was bad at the moment. This week someone very close to me had a stroke they already had a stroke a few weeks before that and I and the family believe they may not make it. I was really upset but I did work that day so I went in and tried to push through. I was able to do my job I just wasn’t as talkative with customers (I worked in retail) so the next day I was supposed to work I had a mental breakdown it was bad it was a mix of that situation, financial situations, my relationship, my best friend leaving for basic training, etc and I was just so overwhelmed I had a breakdown I was balling on the floor I was hyperventilating I couldn’t breathe my bf told me he will call them and inform them of the situation and that I cannot speak due to this. He gave them a call and told them I was having a breakdown I cannot speak on the phone and that I am in no condition to work today this was 7 hours before my shift (when I have these breakdowns they last at least the entire day but it's very rare when these things happen I usually can hold my composure) so he got off the phone and said ok so what I’m gonna say may upset you and I’m very sorry and I knew immediately. He said that they said “Is this like a long-term thing because we need workers who aren’t you know. that. so we are gonna end her employment because we need employees who can give their best attitudes and show up to work if she wants to apply in 6 months she can but she has to be happy and healthy” I was just flabbergasted I didn’t even know what to say this was the first and only time I called in. The store wasn’t short staffed and there were 2 other closers there so I already had coverage and since it was Night Shift it was gonna be very slow. I just am not sure what to even think about this.


Edit: when I said this week I meant last week I forgot today was Monday this whole thing happened yesterday on Sunday I apologize for that

Another edit: thank you all very much for your advice I read all of it and took it all into serious consideration. For those saying my bf should have just said I was sick you are all right. I do believe he was in a panic due to the state I was in I actually showed him all of the comments and he agreed if anything like this ever happens again at another job I will just say I am sick and then I’ll explain my reason IF they ask I don’t like to lie about why I am calling out I’ve always been an honest person but seeing some of these comments made me realize that sometimes you gotta just say “I got the flu” or something I actually will talk to my bf because we do live together if we should take legal advice or honestly just leave it as it is luckily because we do have rent so I have to work my bf messaged his boss if they could hire me at his job and they scheduled me for an interview tomorrow so hopefully it goes well. I was told by him we cannot work the same shifts due to the risk of us breaking up and causing drama in his work environment which is perfectly fine with me. If things do get as bad as it was on Sunday I will look into FMLA I believe one of you mentioned that.

Is it normal to conclude life at 30?,70,0.98,"I'm 27, I'm from London UK, I work a job that goes against my personality, I have maybe 2 friends at most, I have never had a girlfriend for the entirety of my life & I don't think I ever will. Growing up I was never diagnosed for my mental health but I'm convinced I'm on the spectrum for autism due to the fact I've dealt with Body Dysmorphic Disorder since as early as age 4 & used maladaptive daydreaming as a coping mechanism to this day. Safe to say my reality is not meeting up the standards, I feel like I've plateaued in life when it comes to improving my mental health. 

I'm turning 28 in November & I have never left the country once, never really enjoyed my 20s due to the fact i can't adjust to social cues. Everything feels forced with me, I used to think I was ugly growing up & I relentlessly focused all my energy on improving my physical appearance. Safe to say now I think im handsome due to the change of reception I get from women but I still don't believe it due to how I was treated by them when I was younger (PTSD perhaps?)... The breaking point for me now is knowing my Mum may never see me have a child at this rate, she is ill & currently disabled in her mid 50s. It breaks my heart all the time knowing she wants to see her grandchild & I also want this but I've always hated myself so much to the point I could never comprehend letting a woman into my life. I feel like I can offer physical attraction, mental wisdom & a reassuring outlook on actual relationships despite never being in one. But outside that, I work an average job, I've got no friends, I'm a virgin, I can't drive & I'm limited on what enjoyment I can actively bring to a woman due to the fact I've never experienced much in my life. This itself has recently stopped me going for a woman I really admire even though she is also going through her own grievances. 

I've always told myself if I just had a taste of what life a normal person gets to enjoy, I'd be way better but I'm yet to come close to those necessities.  I'm inclined to end my life at 30 if I'm yet to develop & change. I can be the wisest in the shed, without experience I have no proof for my brain to validate a fixated behaviour pattern of normal functional living. I am saddened at the idea to hurt my mother further by ending my life at 30 if I'm to be in the same boat but something in me can't accept how people have it easy in life & I don't even have the basic privileges to even live life.

I feel trapped & I feel burdened by my brain, I'm tired of rationalising all the time. Tired of relying on dopamine from content or being reliant on endorphin release from the gym to feel positive. I'm putting a positive front but deep down I'm dying inside. People can say it's ""depression"", but like I said if I haven't experienced anything my brain has no proof to feel validated, for example it's like labeling someone for laughing because they got tickled. Granted the circumstances I'm in, feeling the way I do is a reasonable byproduct and the fact I persevered with low self esteem for my entire life, it shows I'm far from just dwelling over the idea of depression.  

All I can say is, I'll be taking it to the next level  but I'll be open about my experience. If this doesn't work then nothing will work for me.

Why is suicide wrong?,65,0.85,"Just a disclaimer, I'm not suicidal. I sometimes have suicidal thoughts, but I would never act on them.  
  
So I have severe social anxiety and I find it extremely difficult to relate or fit in with anyone. I oftentimes feel like I'm only doing things just because I want to have friends and fit in with a certain group of people, and it makes me confused about my identity; who I really am, what I value, what I like or don't like, etc. It's like a self-imposed peer pressure. Everything I do, I'm always asking myself, ""Why do I want to do this? Who am I doing this for?""  
  
For example, I got my first (ear) piercing last year and told my therapist at the time about it. At first, she was concerned that I did it because I felt like I needed to in order to fit in. I told her that I actually wanted to and that it was something I was thinking about doing for a whille. She said it was fine as long as I wanted to do it.  
  
So how is suicide different? Why is it wrong? If you genuinely wanted to kill yourself, why shouldn't you do it? What if you just don't want to be alive? What if you just hate it? People always say, ""Do what YOU want to do,"" but why shouldn't I kill myself? Shouldn't I be doing what I want to do? It's my life and my choice, so how does anyone have the right to tell me no, it's wrong? If I wanted to kill myself, why shouldn't I be allowed to do it?  
  
If people have the freedom to do anything they want with their life and they decide that this is something they genuinely want to do, why is it always frowned upon? ""No you shouldn't do it. Your family will hurt. It's selfish."" Well, it's MY life and MY choice. If I didn't want to be here anymore, then I think it would be selfish of others to try to convince me and force me to keep me here. If someone is genuinely suffering and they just genuinely wanted to leave, how is it not selfish for others to tell them otherwise? What gives them the right to take that choice away from them? If someone wanted to walk into a clinic that offers assisted suicide, why shouldn't they be allowed to do it? Why aren't people given the freedom to choose whether they want to live or die?

I saved a life today....,65,0.99,"Hello! I am a part time rideshare driver, in addition to my normal career job.  Normally I love it...getting out and around, talking and meeting people. Etc.   However not so much today.

Earlier today I went to pick up a passenger...it was booked by what I assume was his boss...and the destination was an urgent care that is mostly for workman's comp.  So during the ride he was talking about his hurt knee...then went into how his life is unraveling.   So I sympathetically listened to him....halfway to the destination he starts complaining of chest pains. I asked if he was OK and needed assistance. 

So I pull over on the shoulder of the highway...call 911..then proceed to make him comfortable..keep him calm and alert while we waited...all while checking his pulse and etc.  He was starting to have more pain...then nothing...no pulse.  So here i am...in the back seat performing cpr until the paramedics arrived...and were able to us a defibrillator and revive him.  Then off they went blazing in an ambulance.   He is only 42....2 years older than me.   

I don't know how to feel.  How to process everything.   The police and paramedics told me I might have helped save his life...and how great it was...and listening to uber's safety manager telling me on the phone how I did a great thing and so on...

I have seen many times where people feel great for this...how wonderful it is....but I've also seen where it can negatively affect first responders.

PLEASE HELP! I am mentally disabled snd my mental health care and medications have been taken away with no warning for no reason. What do I do?,67,0.93,"Hi! I really need your help in figuring out what to do in this situation. First off, I am disabled because of a myriad of mental health disorders. OCD, CHRONIC PTSD, GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER, BIPOLAR DISORDER, PANIC DISORDER, and ADHD. 
I am a patient at a telehealth corporation called Eleanor Health. I had been seeing the most amazing, kind, compassionate,and caring psychiatriast I have ever met in my life for since December. She was also giving me DBT therapy.I was rapidly improving and on a path to a great place mentally, until it was all taken away. 
About three weeks ago my appointments with her started to be postponed. I was instead scheduled with a nurse practitoner who had no knowledge of mental health care whatsoever. There was no explation of why I could not see my doctor. My medications were being shuffled around, or threatened to be taken away. This past month has been one of the most stressful months of my life not knowing what was going on. 
They finally put me on the schedule with my doctor June 1st. I had no idea that this would be the last time I was allowed to see her. She was very heavy hearted as well, and it seems as if someone above her was causing this. She also had me on adderall for ADHD and this was taken away without warning. This was also not her decision.
She told me I needed to get my medical records because she had taken careful notes regarding our sessions together, and my marked imorovement with the therapy, adderall, and other medications.
I am now in limbo. Going thru heavy adderall withdrawl. I cannot get out of bed, I am having severe deoression, crying fits, severe anxiety, my nightmares are back, feelings of hopelessness and despair, dread. Feelings that I’m worthless, uncontrollable mood swings, I have lost 15 pounds in the past two weeks, at times I can barely form sentences, also my haur has been falling out and this has never happened.
They did not offer to replace my psychiatriast. Only said I coukd only see a nurse practioner.
This is blatant neglect, derelection of duty, and absolutely goes against everything Eleanor Health claims to be.
I am a total mess. It is difficult for me to do anything right now. 
I am usually pretty thick skinned bc I’ve been thru A LOT, but this is destroying me. I have brought all of this to the attention of the providers at Eleanor health thru a chat in this portal thing and have been ignored completely.
And this has nothing to do with insurance coverage or anything that would make sense.I guarantee you.
What do I do in this situation? Who can I contact for help? Please. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I don't know where to begin, or even why i'm making this post. I just can't sleep and need somewhere to get my thoughts out.

I will start by saying he wasn't just my ""step dad"", he was my father. The man I remember growing up with, looking up to and seeking hard advice from.

My last goodbye was over the phone, I slept for most of that day in denial or.. something. I saw him afew times before that in the hospital, told him I love him, how much he means to me, things I never got to express. But it was only during that phone call when I felt my heart spill for him..

Then he passed that night. And i'm stuck with the wish that I just really said everything he means to me, to him, face to face.

That being said, he was a man who understood, without the need for something to be said. I know inside he knew how much I care, how much he loved me as one of his own. The pain is wishing I spent more time with him, talking, sharing, laughing. My own mental health always got in the way of that. 

I cannot express how much I love him for understanding that, knowing there was so much I wanted to say to him but couldn't find the words for. He just knew I loved him so much.

He died surrounded by my unbelievably loving mother, his parents, and his sister. Im glad to say he was a man with absolutely no regrets and filled the lives of all his family and friends with love, care, and understanding. I love you, Chris.

Was I abused when I was young or was what my pediatrician did normal?,64,0.89,"I (F, 25, US)  have very vivid but short glimpses of memories of going to what I assume was a pediatrician when I was very young. 

Normal health stuff I’m assuming but the thing that I remember is me and brother (M, 27, US) being “checked” down there to make sure our genitals hadn’t closed.

I remember it being explained that they had to “open our privates” so the skin wouldn’t fuse together and “cause problems when we’re older” 
The doctor would use gloved hands and those wooden popsicle stick things I think. 
I remember my brother never seemed to have a reaction, (I wasn’t allowed to see what they did to him cause he was exposed, and vise visa) 
But I remember cry when I would have to pee later cause it burned down bad and my mom acted like this was normal.

I haven’t been able to find anything online about this.

I create fake scenarios in my head and cry,64,0.98,"I'm now 28 years old. From my childhood (around 12 yrs) I have being creating an imaginary world in my head. It consists of characters I watched during that time on TV (these are all human). I started creating different storylines in my head, using all these characters. I myslef became one of the characters. Obviously the one I thought who is very innocent, caring, and good in everyway. Let's call her X. I also imagine bad things happening to X. Like her boyfriend hurting her, cheating on her, him leaving her etc. All these bad things somehow connected to the relationship the X have with her partner. Then I will make myslef cry thinking I am the one facing them. I can think about it for hours and cry. This actually gives me comfort. I would do this before sleeping at the end of a stressful day and feel comfort.

URGENT HELP NEEDED. Kept my friend from suicide for the last 6 years - I don't know how to stop him anymore.,60,0.95,"I'm super stressed right now and I've been feeling sick for a long while today. Help me.

My friend and I are both turning 17 on February 6. Because of our joint birthday, I see him as the similarly-aged brother I never got. He lives in Australia whilst I live in Norway - yet it has never kept us apart.

We both struggle mentally, but he's on an entirely different level. Having been sexually assaulted at a young age, a manipulative, severely mentally ill mother, abusive relationships within the family, being involved with drugs and then being the one who has to fix it all for his messy family; he's understandably tired and has threatened suicide for every single year that I've known him for.

I've always promised to get him out of there when we turned 18. Whenever he was having a manic episode or just being unwell in general, I told him that giving up now isn't worth it considering all of the years he's been dealing with this - yet we're just one year away from breaking off the chains. He has always believed me.

But today I got the unfortunate news that his mother wandered off and overdosed on valium. The valium HE was prescribed for HIS mental health issues. I'm so pissed about it. According to the doctors, she's not well and she might die. This is worse than anything he has ever endured and it was the last thing we needed right now. I've send him messages wishing him well, saying that I hope he's okay and that he can vent as much as he wants to me. No response.

I don't know if any of them are alive right now but I fucking pray to God that at the very least he's alive. I love him so much, more than words can describe. I'm shaking so much yet I can't cry cause this is not an unique situation.

I don't wanna say it but.. *If* he comes back to tell me what's up, what can I say to make him feel better? I'm exhausted.

My best friend died suddenly,62,0.98,"Hey everyone,

It's been 9 days since I received a call from my nephew (my best friends eldist) telling me that his Dad was dead. Luckily, my girlfriend was helping me pack as I'm moving from Colorado to Georgia to go live with her. So she was physically there for support for that.

I spent years dealing with panic attacks and debilitating anxiety but haven’t had one in 7 years. Here’s what I learned through self-healing without medication. I hope it’s helpful to others.,61,0.91,"•	Anxiety and panic attacks were something I was experiencing, not something that I “had”. Letting go of the idea that this was a disorder or something I had to deal with for life was really important.

•	Meditation in the beginning felt impossible because my Nervous System was so disregulated that my mind and body didn’t feel safe when I gave it space to heal. Persisting was the single best thing I ever did for myself.

•	I didn’t have any self-love or self-care. I realised I didn’t know how to say no to people or things. I was constantly busy and exhausted. I would make myself available to others when deep down it didn’t suit me. Starting to say no was really hard at first but it has been the second best thing I have ever done for myself.

•	I realised I had been operating from my head and was virtually cut off from my body. I could label my emotions mentally but was never actually FEELING those emotions. Meditating allowed me to start feeling safe in my body for the first time in probably 20 years. It also helped me to become more deeply connected to myself, life and other people. My relationships have been so fulfilling and nourishing as a result.

•	I realised how long I had been living in a state of survival and how much of that resulted from childhood trauma. Instead of running from it, I began to deal with the experiences I had growing up and the reality of what that had meant for me. I could then make different choices that truly supported me instead of doing things that kept inducing anxiety and stress.

•	Accepting the reality for things as they are instead of how I wanted them to be was important. The longer I denied my own reality, the worse I continued to feel. Trying to hold on to the stories of what I wanted was far more painful than being honest about how they actually are.

•	Drugs & alcohol had been a way to feel good and confident in the moment but always intensified the anxiety and panic attacks. When I began to calm my Nervous System and stopped living in survival mode 24/7, I felt connected and content within which naturally meant I didn’t feel an urge to do those things.

•	Caffeine helped me to deal with my lack of energy that resulted from never sleeping but it was always perpetuating the problem. The more I had, the more anxious I felt and the more often I had panic attacks. Learning how to put my self-care and needs first meant that I could finally do things for myself that I really needed to heal instead of quick fixes.

Or are there people out there who are just content to exist?

 I know there’s no real answer to the “meaning of life” question but how do people make their own lives feel meaningful?

I hate myself because I gained weight,64,0.92,"My (25f) entire life, I was 120-130lbs at 5’7. I’ve always been on the skinnier side. I never had a problem with my body image until I started gaining weight. 

I am now 187lbs. The largest I have ever been. I have red stretch marks on my boobs, my thighs, the back of my legs, my fucking lady bits. It’s embarrassing. 

I hate that I’m like this, but I hate myself now. I don’t want to see family because I know they will talk about it. I don’t want to see my husband’s family because they’ll talk about it. I’m scared to go to the store because I feel like all anyone sees is my weight. I haven’t taken photos of myself in a long time. I used to stream, but quit because I couldn’t be on camera. 

I can’t stress this enough, I hate myself. I hate the way I look. I stopped having sex with my husband because of my weight gain. I’ve tried to lose weight but I physically can’t right now. I am always hungry and so tired. I think there may be something wrong with me because of how much I sleep. I sleep 13 hours a day. Doesn’t matter what time I go to bed, I will wake up at 1pm every day. 

None of my clothes fit me. I have to wear my husbands clothes. I recently bought sweatpants because that’s the only thing I’m comfortable in. 

I don’t know why I hate myself so much because of this. I have never thought badly about people who are overweight. I have never treated anyone differently for being overweight. I truly do not care if someone is overweight. But for some reason, I am disgusted with myself. 

I’m scared I will never be my old self again. It’s so hard to ignore the feeling that I’m hungry. I have a hard time exercising because my shins hurt and I get tired so, so fast. 

The worst part is that this just happened one day. Literally. Last year in October, it just happened. I started getting hungry and I began to feel insanely tired. I can’t go through my day without laying down to rest or nap. 

Lately, the need to eat hasn’t been as bad. But it doesn’t matter, I just gain weight like crazy.

Why am I being mean to my boyfriend?,62,0.76,"My (25F) has a stomach bug, and since then I started being very mean to him. I already knew I had problems with these kind of things, it’s happened in the past with another boyfriend.

It’s like when someone (mostly a boyfriend) is sick with some virus, fever, etc I can’t stand the situation. I start being anxious, panicking and it makes me uncomfortable, and I project these feeling onto that person, being mean, irritable and mistreating him. This usually doesn’t happen if it’s some other type of illness  (like it doesn’t happen with a simple headache or something more serious). I’m also emetophobic.

We’re in a long distance relationship and I stopped replying to his messages for hours, I told him I didn’t want to hear from him, and when he told me he had a stomachache I replied in a very cold way. This obviously led to a big argument where I kept being petty. He just wanted support. My only point was to humiliate him, mock him and make him sad and suffering, even after the argument. I’m hating him. I’m freaking out.

I told him I’m not really myself right now but haven’t told him why. He understands. It would make me uncomfortable and vulnerable just talking about this with him. I know this isn’t right and I’m really ashamed of myself. I really love him and I feel sorry for him, for the fact that he’s sick and that he has to deal with someone like me. I usually am normal and really kind and loving. But I also have this part of me I can’t suppress. 

I just want to say I’m not like this, usually I’m a good and empathic person. But I know there’s something wrong with me. I have other types of behaviours that make me think that. I feel so bad. Apart from this episode, no one would suspect this because I cover it quite well. It’s like I’m two people in one.

A video game community made me depressed for over two years,60,0.9,"

I wish this never happened to me, not even on my worst enemy.

When I was 15, I used to love a game called Sky, a game categorized as one of the nicest and most accepting communities out there on the internet, and people don’t usually get bad experiences there; but I did, and it was horrible. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to share the name because I was scared of more bullying, or people saying that I’m making this up, for not liking their community. That’s how stressed I was. 

I mainly played it for its musical mechanics, their piano. I used to play it so much that it was just the only thing that made me feel alive. Over time, I encountered many issues in the game so I wanted to rant about it in the community, not in a rude way. Issues with the game mechanics, and other things, like not wanting to be recorded without my consent when I play music. (It made many people there angry for some reason) I also tried proposing ideas to the developers of that game, to tweak a few things so that it’s easier for me to play, they said they’ll get back to that, but never did. 

But because to those certain people in that community, it was a ridiculous thing to be stressed over. So they ridiculed me, and called me names, and said some of the worst shit you can think of, because that’s what the internet does; a massive cesspool, a place where you can anything you want, and not get consequences. A few remaining people still tried to help but were mostly puzzled, but didn’t get why I was so upset over the issue. I wish I knew that before I posted. I didn’t realize at the time that this interaction would truly put a dent in me. 

That was over 3 years ago. For a long time I wanted them to apologize for what they did. To apologize that they hurt me, so much that not even words can even describe my hurt. 

Then I realized; no one cares, I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself, that no one actually cares. I’ve never felt so lonely, so isolated, dejected; it seemed as if no one else had my issues, which made me feel even more lonely, I then get angry and then I cry, and the cycle repeats. It wasnt fair; everyone else gets to be content with their games, while I get traumatized. I remember feeling hopeless for a long time. I wanted to disappear. I probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway, poof, gone in the wind, literally. Haha…….

I’m 18 now. I’m recovering, but recovery has been tough. I’m getting by day by day. I’m slowly accepting that some people are just assholes. And I just gotta move on, despite how painful it was for me. I’m choosing to do other better things in life for me. Hobbies like math, music (other instruments not related to sky), or art. It won’t resolve whatever happened but it suppresses my thoughts for a few hours, like alcohol but without the effects of being drunk. I cannot ever go to the past, and change what happened, what happened truly traumatized me, and I don’t think it’ll ever go away. 

I remember posting about this in this subreddit three years ago. it made me feel bad that no one replied, but wasn’t sure why it was like that. 

I miss my sky musical instrument. It might’ve even become my career choice, if that existed.

Daughter has Precocious Puberty,59,0.95,"Daughter has Precocious Puberty

My 8 year old daughter was diagnosed with precocious puberty. 

She was showing signs of puberty since she was 7 (last year)…Also, physical symptoms such as slight body odor, hair in armpits etc.)

Endocrinologist at Childrens Hospital says if we choose not to take hormone blockers or implant, she’ll most likely get her period before the age of 10.

Since I am a dad and a man, I have no idea what my daughter may be going through right now, emotionally and physcially.

I want what’s best for her yet at the same time I can’t speak for her.  My daughter says she desperately doesn’t want her period but at the same time she says she’s afraid of shots.

My wife is open minded and leaning towards getting her shots, but like me, she’s nervous about the outcome and side effects for our daughter.

Everything was physical fine.  I have tried to watch sad movies to cry so hard that I would no more tears and that did work.  I tried looking at pictures of him but that didn’t help.

I can’t take take PTO cause I am in my 90 day probation period and although my boss and a coworker has been extremely supportive I need to be able to go and stay at work for awhile.

"I'm not afraid of dying. I'm afraid that one day, I might actually muster the courage to finally end it.",58,1.0,"As long as I breathe, I always find myself spiraling down to nothingness and it hurts how there's nothing I can do to drag myself out of this void. There's no one I am comfortable sharing these emotions that even I, feel alienated from myself if thats even possible. 

I am ashamed of what I have become and I dont know how to tell my 10 year old self that no, it didnt get any better, it was just the beginning of my end. I was a good student, exemplary even, despite all the abuse Ive been through but as all stories of burnout go, I am now here in my undergraduate studies not able to graduate after seven years. I feel jealous of my peers who are now soaring in their careers while I'm here rotting in my bed typing this out of pity of myself.

It's not like I have completely given up on myself - I strive hard to make myself better, every single day. I work two jobs after my classes so I can eat at least once a day and fund my studies. But you know what, it just feels like I've been dealt with bad cards at the beginning making me destined to lose in life. Would I have been better if my father did not physically and emotionally hurt me? If I dont feel betrayed and abandoned by mother? If I actually have the resources to fund my interests and hone my craft? 

The worse part is I am actually quite vocal about not being mentally well. But it always feels like it's being downplayed into a joke. Or did I set myself up as a person not to be taken seriously? Idk. Is it the romanticization of depression among my peers that makes me want to burrow all these feelings to myself? Maybe. 

I don't know what to do anymore. The idea of dying  often dwells in my mind, in fact it hasn't left my mind since the time it has sprung in it. It has buried its roots deep in the crevices of my tiny brain.  I might do it and I think I can. But I dont want to for the sake of people I care for.

i used a thc vape and now i don’t know what is real and what isn’t.,55,0.82,"hi ! i’m not sure where to post this but since it’s affecting my mental health i’ll post it here. to preface this, i’ve smoked weed before and it did nothing for me so i figured i had a high tolerance (i do not apparently) and i also have anxiety and am on anxiety meds.

two days ago i took like 10 or so hits of my friends thc vape and it was a baddddd experience. like i greened out. long story short i threw up a little and it was like my brain way asleep. i knew what was happening but i couldn’t stop it. my heart was racing and i thought i was gonna have a heart or panic attack and my pupils were tiny. plus this was all in college so it was just really horrible. this lasted about and hour and a half to two hours and then i was sorta ok for the rest of the day.

yesterday i was fine until i was in work and suddenly it all happened again. it wasn’t as bad but my brain was shutting off and it felt like i was dreaming and i couldn’t tell what was happening (and i’m still not 100% sure what was real) i managed to feel ok after like an hour but it just started all again an hour later and lasted like two hours this time. i tested my heart rate and it was 62bpm (which is very low for me).

now today i’ve stayed home but i still can’t tell what is real and if i’m just dreaming and i’m so scared that i am actually in a dream and none of this is happening but also what if it is ??? i tried telling my mom but she didn’t care so maybe it’s just my imagination ??? i can’t remember things like my short term memory is going and i don’t know what’s happening to me ? i’m so scared and i don’t know how to fix it. it’s like i’m completely dissociative but also i kinda know i am but also what if it’s all in my head ???

"My life crashed down around me, how can I rebuild after deep trauma?",56,0.99,"Hey everyone, I am hoping that by coming here I can find some insight into how to pull myself out of this rut I found myself in.  
  
As a back story, I was married, I have three kids, I was the executive director of a non profit in a big city, I had a large social circle, friends and things to do, and I was quite happy and content with my life. I wasn't wealthy, but I was happy and thats all the monetary gain I needed. Fast forward to 5 years ago, my spouse grew bored and started doing some off the wall things like spending days or weeks away from the home with me having to figure out how to work and take care of the kids. Eventually I found out she was dating another man and asked her to work to resolve it with me or leave. She chose to leave.  
  
I held onto the non profit for a year before finally giving it up, but my mental health has been horrid with no little improvement over the last four years. I have been in 5 relationships in that time, all failed and I blame myself. I am not mentally capable of facilitating a romantic relationship in a healthy way, so I realized I need to just step back and work on myself which is why I'm here.  
  
I have a regular job now, I work a 9-5 which is nice because there is structure. I am not longer disciplined enough to run my own schedule. Perhaps there is just no motivation. I have almost no social circle and for some reason blame my looks. I may not be the prettiest man, but people liked me back then   
I don't understand why they'd have a problem with me now. I go to work and struggle to carry a conversation. I often find myself trying to escape the conversation while at the same time craving the interaction. It's weird. I want to have friends, I want to talk to people, but a friend will call and I avoid the call, I don't pick up.   
  
I forced myself to go to karaoke last night at a local bar and invited some of my friends. Every single one declined. So I sat there by myself wondering what was wrong with me.  
  
I don't believe in myself at all and I think that is the core of the issue. I see myself as a failure. I think people are judging my ugly face and don't want to be friends with me. I feel like a loser. I feel completely alone. I don't get out much because I have my three kids (7, 13, and 14 yo) full time. I want to rekindle my friendships with my old friends but I reach out and they don't seem interested or they don't message me back at all. I want to try and make new friends, but the thought of creating something new terrifies me.   
  
I want to return to the social creature I used to be. I want to be able to carry a conversation and build a deep relationship with ANYONE, even just one person, but I can't. I'm crippled by fear. I get up and leave when someone comes into the break room and it's just us two. I live in this nightmare that I Want to be close to someone, but can't.  
  
How do I rebuild confidence? How can I once again believe in myself? Has anyone experienced this, what can I do?  
  
TLDR:  
My life fell apart when my wife left me and my kids four years ago, and my social life and self confidence have been in shambles and I'm trying to rebuild but don't know where to start and am asking for help from this community to help me get back on my feet and be able to at least carry a conversation without feeling like I'm not worth someone else's time.

"Found out from my new therapist, that my old therapist who abandoned me said she won’t ever work with me again, despite telling me in our final session “that the door was open down the road” for it",56,0.9,"Last time I updated on this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/14kn5hu/really_struggling_again_after_another_therapy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

My new therapist had me sign an ROI because she wanted to coordinate care with her and find out the whole picture of the termination.

Firstly I found out that my therapist made the decision to terminate me, and subsequent decision to withdraw being willing to ever work with me again, because her supervisors told her she had to (to “protect her license”, which makes it sound like she/the supervisors are throwing me and my well-being under the bus to cover their ass professionally.)

But yeah that’s what my old therapist told my new one when they spoke on the phone.


That was honestly the last thing I was hanging on for. I have no hope. This was the last straw, I’ve been abandoned so many times by so many people that I’ve been close to. My old therapist used to say that “she was the exception” as proof that not literally everyone would hurt and abandon me, but now there’s literally none. There’s never been one exception, not one person in my life, who ended up not abandoning me.

I don’t know what to do. I’m in shock. I was already in shock and disbelief that this was all happening to begin with.

But I had a scrap of hope that this wound could be healed if I got a chance to work with her again and resolve it with her.

The new therapist is okay, but not nearly as understanding or just doesn’t intuitively “get me” the way the old one did.

I have no hope anymore. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I can’t take this.

"Parents forced me to wear diapers and only one set of clothes for school year, now my life is a mess, how do I fix and get past?",57,0.98,"For context. I was adopted and my foster parents were brand new to parenting. They eventually adopted me. I was very rebellious but also suffering from super traumatic early childhood events, such as getting sexually assaulted and raped by previous foster parents that were men, sexually assaulted by step siblings and mother. Fast forward to 8th grade, I was hitting puberty, and very rebellious. My adoptive parents decided to ""teach me a lesson"" and took away all clothes, underwear, shoes, door off hinges, any sort of privacy whatsoever. I had to shower with cold showers because I was ungrateful"" aka water heater was turned off when I went to take a shower. My parents then gave me a ragged set of Vans, a Karate shirt that I had received from a previous Karate class that year, one pair of underwear, one pair of socks, and one set of shorts. I had to have this set of clothes for the entire year to PROVE that I was grateful to get back my privileges as they said. So no lying, no cheating in school, no ducking around personal questions, etc. I feel like this life event set off a massive traumatic event. I was bullied relentlessly for wearing the same clothes day in and day out, appearing in yearbook photos, activities, sports, etc with the same outfit. I was asked if I stunk like shit because I wore the same thing, if I asked to wear the same thing, if I was only allowed to have one set of clothes. It made me ashamed. I started becoming anorexic, bulimic, staying in the bathroom during lunch and recess, purging after meals at home. Became depressed (I was diagnosed with depression after this event whereas before I never had depression, I was a very happy kid.) I didn't want it getting out that the people who took me in were treating me like this but I was convinced I deserved it because I was such a bad rebellious kid.

This life event has led all the way to now. I can't be photographed wearing the same thing. I can't wear any article more than one day in a row. I have spent thousands of dollars on clothes, perfumes, colognes, shoes, socks, underwear, you name it clothing wise or accessory wise for a male, I've had it it every color, pattern, etc. Some days I have multiple outfit changes because I have the creeping feeling that I've worn it before and it either gets thrown away or pushed into the closet to wear a different day. I hundreds of perfumes and colognes, lotions, anything to make ""the smell"". It's a phantom feeling or smell I get wear I think that I smell really bad and have to cover it up. I will stop whatever I am doing, and excuse myself to put on lotion, cologne, body spray, perfume. Anything because its been drilled into my head that I think someone will comment on my appearance and I want to be prepared.

Was what my parents did abuse? Or were they just being normal parents? When I talk to people about this situation, they chalk it up to them being new parents. Even my parents continually tell me I'm being dramatic and my version of events was nothing like what really happened. They said they got the idea from a church friend.

Another reason why I wear multiple sets of underwear per day is because my parents forced me to wear diapers during high school and threatened to tell my school, and class. They let my teachers know that I was wearing diapers if anyone asked. I was a bedwetter due to being raped and abused and my parents had no idea I was SA'ed. So they kept telling me I was lazy and that I didn't want to go to the bathroom. 

I can't seem to work past these events. I still have hundreds and hundreds of clothes, perfumes, colognes, anything to mask. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos of minimalism and minimalist clothing and it gives me panic attacks to think of someone else wearing the same thing or something that has one shade (one man wears same black shirt, black jeans or blue jeans) it's the ONLY thing he says he has in his closet. His videos pop up and I usually have a meltdown because it freaks me out when I least expect it. 

How do I work past this? I am talking to a therapist but haven't brought this situation to light.

The mental health support system in the US is just kind of awful.,57,0.98,"Like, I get it that you don't want me to kill myself, but you could probably handle it just a bit better. I don't understand why they have it organized in the way that they do. I have to hide everything in my head from everybody just so I'm not thrown into a hospital and locked up like a prisoner, all the while having to worry about constant therapy and possible assault. You can't and really shouldn't force therapy on anyone, yet they do it anyways. None of these thoughts are organized because I just got fed-up with bottling my emotions so I'm not treated like a maniac, and I'm sorry about it. I just wish I could talk to someone without being locked away and forced into therapy, but I know that I'll inevitably get thrown into one. I'm going to a counselor soon, and I'm going to try and be entirely honest with her. With all the suicidal and self-harming thoughts that I've had, I'll be going to a psych ward in no time.

&#x200B;

Like it just feels so backwards. ""Oh, you're traumatized and feel alone? Let's throw you into what is essentially a prison and treat you like a borderline insane, unhuman freak. All the while, other potentially dangerous people can do anything and likely get away unpunished."" I may be overexaggerating, but Imo it's just disgusting and stupid. I don't feel like it fixes anything, but of course since I've never been to one I don't really know. Can anyone who's been to one tell me their experience, and if it helped. Those in other countries, tell me what your psych wards are like too, I'm curious if those are similar to ours, or better/worse.

&#x200B;

Overall I'm just scared. I'm going to get locked away and treated like a danger for like weeks and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm doomed to wander the halls of a facility sooner or later. It's either that or I hide everything from everyone and become lost in myself even more. Either way something awful and traumatizing is going to happen, both of them equally horrible.

Is it okay to cry for absolutely no reason whatsoever?,56,0.98,"Backstory, I don't think I'm depressed anymore, childhood 'trauma' is still there but regardless of that.

Now, is is normal to cry for no reason at all? Right now I have some college stress due to something weird I never thought would happen and even micro things are making me tear up. 

This isn't the first time though, I cry out atleast once a week minimum for the past 5 years and I'm not sure if its normal. 

I do love crying though, it makes me remove all of my pain through my tears and from someone who did worse stuff to herself, this is a big thing I'm proud of.

Anyways, is it okay to cry weekly for absolutely no proper reason whatsoever?

The genres of gore I watch have definetly expanded, I used to have a bit of a mental block for compound fractures and stuff showing bones and self harm, that stuff just irked me for some reason, but I'm completely fine with that stuff now.

Since I became 15 (a day ago at most) I decided to just try and drop it because I know it's obviously fucked up and I am becoming a bit of a mess. However I don't really know if I'm facing withdrawl. But I'm extremely jumpy and I feel like my bones don't rest well in my skin, specifically in my fingers, It's like a numbness feeling mixed with a extremely minute droning pain.

🥀 Trigger warning: s*icide ⚠️,52,0.9,"Christmas has always been traumatic for me for years. But today really set it in stone having my best friends Mum message me asking if I could call her, definitely had a off feeling to it but I did it thinking maybe she was wondering if I'd heard from Emma the last two days or something, because genuinely Emma was usually out and about alot, either at her Dads or staying with friends all around Melbourne etc.
Her Mum proceeds to tell me that my close as friend of the 17 years of my life had committed s*icide and that she had found her this morning.

I'm broken is an understatement.
I have not felt this numb, detached from reality or in this amount of shock in over a decade as the, what felt like 500 Mack Trucks hit me all through my body hearing that but also hearing her Mother try so hard to hold her composure just to respectfully inform me about it.

My boyfriend (38M) feels guilty every time we are intimate. He feels like I (32F) am too young for him.,54,0.94,"My boyfriend and I haven't been together long, only a month. He's been struggling to keep an erection when we are physically together and often loses it if things progress to sex, which we haven't had btw. He has shared that medically it's not a problem, because he has masturbated alone to orgasm.

He told me that he's never dated anything younger than him, only his age and older, and has difficulty wrapping his head around sleeping with a ""younger"" woman.
After a recent heart to heart I learned that he was molested as a child by two different men, one was a religious leader, and the other was an older neighbor. So maybe being with someone younger than him puts him back into this raw state of vulnerability that he has yet to unravel and heal. I brought up therapy and he shut it down right away. And I get it, this is uncomfortable to sit with.

He says he desires me and is so attracted to me, but once the guilt hits, he just can't seem to turn it off and he loses his boner. He said it feels like a lump in his throat that he can't swallow or take out. He has focused so much on my pleasure but now it's starting to get to me where I can't give in return. I want him to feel good, too!

I want to be intimate with him and support him but I don't know how. I haven't pushed sex, in fact I had insecurities thinking maybe he wasn't attracted enough to me or my body. I'm scared he won't get over our age gap and that i'll be single again really soon.

My therapist told me he is disappointed in me,52,0.98,"Hi, 
I see my therapist once a week.
Last week when I spoke to him, we talked about how my dad is pressuring me to meet this one woman who posted on Facebook that she is looking for additional friends for her friends group. They like to speak English and so do I (I am from the Czech republic so not a native speaker) so my dad figured it would be perfect to meet them and share our interests. Well, he kept pressuring me, telling me that I will never find friends if I continue living like this etc. I genuinely thought I could meet her but after he kept bringing it up every 15 minutes and giving me monologues on how I don't talk to anyone etc, I became less and less interested in meeting her. 

I told my therapist all that and he said it's okay not to put pressure on myself with this kind of thing. Then I told him that honestly I got used to the idea that I might be alone for some time before I go to college and finish my current school (business school), which is 3 more years. 

He told me I shouldn't think that way and I said that I didn't mean that I am not gonna talk to anyone. I just know that if I try I am gonna fail because that's how it happened every time so far. We joked around about some stuff for a while. But then he got serious out of nowhere and told me ""well, I am disappointed in you. Now you know what it feels like when someone is actually disappointed in you."" And it literally hurt so much, it came out of nowhere. I don't know what he meant by the second sentence since the issues we usually talk about (even earlier that session) are that my family sees me as less than them and everyone is disappointed in me. 

I am so anxious to go see him tomorrow. Should I bring up how I felt last session? I cried on my way home and I think about it every day. I saw him as the only person who gets me and has my back but hearing him say he was disappointed in me literally broke my heart. 

I ended up going to meet with the girl the same day I had the session (after the session), there were more people coming in. She didn't know what I looked like so as soon as I got into the café where we were supposed to meet I got extremely anxious, I ordered a lemonade and sat at a different table. I ended up crying, paid and left and got a panic attack on my way home. I think I only did it to ""prove him wrong"" in my head haha which is stupid. But I was thinking maybe by saying that he wanted to push me in the right direction. Well it didn't end well.

[M32] I'm quitting porn consumption.,52,0.96,"TL;DR: I've decided to stop consuming porn in all forms. My reasons are non-religuous, non-political and I think they're well-thought based on my experience. I'm currently in the process of deleting everything and closing down all accounts/users. 

Basically that's it. I'm currently in a healthy 5-year relationship with my SO. I've been consuming porn (all kind) for a handful of years and I think I've had enough. My SO knowns I/I've watch/ed porn of all kind and is totally cool with it. We even comment on dudes/girls irl that we encounter.

A few weeks ago I willingly deleted beyond recovery my 1,5TB collection of porn material,, which had been harvested over the years. I thought it would feel like a liberation but it just went as ""meh, alright, delete that shit"". Even the days after, my concern was if my horny-self would deeply regret that decision, but not.
I currently still have my Pornhub and Chaturbate accounts up, as well as the email used exclusively for this kind of stuff and some other websites which I need to track down. These are my next targets for the upcoming days.

My reasons for it? A couple:
1. IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME. Man, I could go edging for like 1h every day. It felt good, but afterwards the blame and guilt for investing so much time were disgusting. I know I can edge without visuals for as long as I want, but the video shit is addictive.

2. I started to kinda ""need"" the visuals to get aroused/horny. Sometimes I even surfed TW in order to get those 30s of stimulus prior to having sex. Not good.

3. I was supporting an industry (doesn't matter if pro or amateur/homemade) with dark interests (prostitution, money for sex, e.g.) I also knew this while surfing but my horny-self was clearly in charge and that issues became totally secondary.

4. The past half year, while consuming porn I started to feel it as an addiction. I wasn't thinking the whole day about porn and wanking, but on the way back home I would definitely think about which user I would watch, where I would wank, etc. instead of using that time to do sth. productive.

5. I've seen increasingly more dudes that also took this step and everything where good words.

"My girlfriend was admitted to the emergency psychiatric unit at the local hospital via emergency services (police, EMT) because she said she wanted to kill herself",55,0.98,"My (34M) girlfriend (38F) had a bad weekend running into friends and had a panic attack.

She’s playing it down a bit at the hospital… but she’s really determined to ending her life now once she can get out… i don’t think she wants help. She’s truly over it. She’s been seeing doctors and everything for years. She attempted on her life multiple times in the last ten years. 
I fell in love with her recently. We’ve dating for the last 10 months. She recently had a meltdown told me she didn’t love me… this weekend she had a bad situation and i came to check on her after she threatened about her life. She tells me show loves me now that we aren’t fighting… but that’s beyond the point. I’m one of the only people she has left she feels. She hates her parents cuz they want to keep her admitted.
She doesn’t hear voices or anything i think but she does suffer from bipolar disorder and has pretty insane mood swings.
Anyhow, idk what to do. She seems
Pretty determined to end it all. She’s very financially able at her age and with her career to fly abroad and attempt it away form
Anyone to save her. She’s attempted twice in Mexico in the last year just irresponsibly taking Xanax with alcohol.
Anyways it seems very much out of my hands. Her parents are in another state and they’re going to release her in my custody… wht do i do knowing she’s still going to be down and out when she’s out?

My childhood bestfriend is suicidal and shows creepy redflags,55,0.96,"/!\\ trigger warning : Rape, Suicide /!\\

Hello, sorry for the long post. I'll try to be brief, but I have a lot of infos. I'll give a bit of context first and then say some redflags things he said to me.

**Context** : My friend (19M) has been in a depressive state for about 3 or 4 years now, and is going in a downward spiral. He feels terribly outcasted in Uni. He says that he hates ""normies"" because they to social event and that he will never be like them. He's saying that everyone hates him and his disgusted by him, or that he's a degenerate. He deleted all his social networks 1 year ago. I tried to hang out with him a few times now, and I thought that it was going better over this summer, but since the beginning of the school year he's been having suicidal thoughts again.

The other day he told me something like :

>""This guy asked if I went to the big party uni was organising, and when I said no, he looked a me with a mix of hate and disgust. I fucking hate him I want to kill him.""

He also told me that he thinks a lot about r\*pe, but not in a sexual way. More like an advanced kind of violence. He told me one day that he wanted to r\*pe a girl he hated, not for the pleasure, just to hurt her. (Or to hire a guy to rape her for the same results). He also said that for the past few weeks, the only thing that would give meaning to his life would be to become a terrorist, just that he doesn't know who to aim yet. He told me that he was interested into going to the shooting range in hit city to pass time, which is something oddly new.I'm sorry if it sound fake or laughable. I don't know if he's serious or just wants to be edgy/provocative. When I asked if he was serious about killing people he said ""I would if I could, but most serial killers had social skills to lure their victims"" and that he wasn't motivated enough.

I don't know what to do. I already told him to see a psychologist multiple time, but he doesn't want to. I tried to give him advices, but I feel like this is doing more harm than good. I also tried to do hang out with him, but it's really hard to motivate him, and we don't have that much time anymore with school. I hope he's not really dangerous, but I don't want to find out that he hurt himself/others and that I could have avoided that.

tl:dr : My friend has suicidal thoughts and wants to harm people (?), I don't know what to do

Why am I so different from everyone else?,53,0.92,"I (21F) feel like there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm not normal. I know there is no such thing as ""normal"" and that we're all different...but hear me out. I am a college graduate (I actually graduated when I was 19). I see other girls my age going out, having fun, going to parties, traveling the world, etc. all while I'm just here existing. I don't feel jealous or like I'm missing out, I just have no desire to do any of that. Instead of shopping with friends, I prefer shopping alone. And instead of shopping for clothes to go to wear to parties, I prefer shopping for cozy pajama sets and things to clean and organize my home with. On the weekend, instead of hanging out with friends or going out, I complete a long list of chores and tasks. When I don't finish my list, I feel worthless and hate myself. After coming home from work, it's the same routine every day: change into pajamas, relax a little, make dinner, have a shower, relax more, then I'm usually in bed before 10 but don't go to sleep until 12ish. If my schedule is disrupted, I feel agitated.  

It's like I'm an old lady trapped in a 21-year-old's body. I'm not afraid of making friends or going out, it just doesn't interest me. Crowds and social situations make me feel overstimulated, irritated, and uncomfortable, and I don't really see why they're necessary in the first place. It’s not that I can’t socialize, I’m actually very very good at it. I  just don’t like doing it; it’s outside of my comfort zone. The smallest things irritate me beyond belief. I hate 90% of the people I meet and hate going out - I actually have a Vit. D deficiency. I'm much happier in places familiar to me but I'm happiest while at home with my blinds shut, away from the outside world. Maybe I'm just a stupid, lazy complainer, I don't know. I've thought maybe I'm on the autism spectrum, but I don't know that either. Or maybe I'm just really, super depressed. I have depression and anxiety and I honestly feel like my life itself is depressing and repetitive but I'm not necessarily unhappy with it. I'm just feeling mentally and physically depleted and I wish my interests were more ""normal."" All I do is exist. I have no substance. 

My mom thinks I’m just still young and figuring things out and just need to build more confidence but this seems like more than that. 

Sorry if this makes no sense but at least I got it off my chest (kind of).

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not claiming to be on the autism spectrum, it's just something that's come across my mind as a possibility. I was an odd child and I'm now an odd adult, but that doesn't mean that I'm automatically autistic. Just like how the fact that I like to organize and make lists doesn't automatically mean I have OCD. It just means I'm different, there doesn't have to be an official medical diagnosis. If I did want to receive an official diagnosis, of course, I'd go to a professional, not the internet. I did 8 years of CBT and EMDR as well as 2-3 years of OT and never felt it was beneficial. As some of you have pointed out/speculated, I am highly intelligent and mature for my age. I graduated from high school at 16 and from a 4-year university at 19. I will be graduating with a master's degree later this year at 21. I never really struggled academically but found it difficult to make friends and feel accepted, even though I had friends (I become more anti-social and introverted when I started undergrad), I still felt like an outcast.

Boyfriend is running away from life itself :(,53,0.88,"My boyfriend and I haven’t been together too long, and 100% moved in together too early. I am 24 and he just turned 30. I know everyone’s going to say the same thing everyone in my life says, which is that I deserve better. For one moment I need some people to not tell me that and instead understand that I love this man with everything in me. I have never looked at another person and felt.. idk.. safe? 

That being said, he turned 30 a couple of weeks ago and has been struggling a lot the past few months mentally. He has chrons so he’s sick a lot, even though we try and follow a vegan diet to help. He misses a lot of work due to it and then in turn feels like shit. He is new to the area so does not have many friends but me. I’ve tried to push him out to meet new people or get us out with couples to help. 

Nowww for the hard part… last Monday we signed a lease together to finally get us some more space and pay less rent (we’ve both been really stressed financially). That night we got into a tiff and the next morning he quit his job, called his mom, and moved home. Outside of me being heartbroken, I am so worried about him :(( i feel like he’s just running away from everything because of his depression. His mom is very loving, but also in my opinion, isn’t really helping. She doesn’t even have food he can eat in the house normally and does not work herself. I can tell my boyfriend wants to get out of this cycle, but I don’t know how to help anymore :( I’m constantly listening to podcasts and reading books to get myself out of my own depressions. As a child his dad left, and after trying to meet up with him a few years ago and he didn’t show, he’s given up. He was cheated on by a fiancé in 2019. He’s just an anxious sensitive guy who wants nothing but peace, but almost seems to think he doesn’t deserve it? When I said to stop pushing me away, his response was that he has to. That it is best for him to be alone, but it’s never best to be alone.

I hate being a mom,51,0.87,"As the title states. I hate being a mom. I got pregnant when i was 15 and had my son when i was 16. I have struggled with mental health all my life. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder when i was 8 years old. I have tried multiple medications and been to multiple therapist but nothing has really helped my mental health. When i was 13 i started to over sexualize myself. I would wear low cut shirts, send nudes and started having sex when i was 14. That led to me getting pregnant when i was 15. My parents wouldn’t let me get an abortion or give up my son for adoption. The father was not involved and i was left to raise my son alone until i was 18 he took me to court and sued me which i am now 30 grand in debt over. My son goes to his dads every other weekend but that’s it. When I gave birth to my son i experienced really bad postpartum depression. I think i got over it but some days i’m not sure. Either way i have no bound with my son. No connection he’s just a responsibility. Now i take really good care of my son for my age. He goes regularly to the dentist and doctors. Has new clothes, shoes toys the works. Eats healthy meals and i try to give him as much love as i can like taking him out to the movies, doing fun things like the elf on the shelf but i don’t feel anything. I feel like i’m just masking all my emotions and going thru the motions. Lately all i feel like i do is yell at my son because he wastes food, won’t pick up, throws tantrums and i feel like it’s because he is feeding off my energy and environment. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I genuinely can’t do this another 14 years.

Edit: A lot of people are suggesting i give my parents custody. That’s just not an option. unfortunately parental cycles are hard to break. My mom was distant and wasn’t there for me most of my life.

I actually took some care of myself????!,52,0.99,"I actually washed my hair AND brushed my teeth today.
I typically put off any showering activities for as long as I can (until I think my hair looks noticeably greasy I guess) and really didn't want to today even though I kept telling myself to. A friend encouraged me and I ended up washing my hair even though I didn't really feel like it.
I also took time to blow dry my hair when I typically air dry it (I felt like I'd probably be in a better mood with it more dry than wet) and I used hair ointment I've had after.

I even brushed my teeth, which I never do (I know I should more because I'll regret it in the future but I can't typically bring myself to do basic hygiene).

I'm currently debating on if I want to take a bath tomorrow/later (1:54am) to lift my mood more if I can, I really need to bring myself to relax and I heard a bath can typically help with that.

Seasonal depression and all year stress with anxiety (plus school, since I'm a teenager) is really beating me up and I don't talk about it to anyone for the most part, so it's more difficult to handle since nobody really knows. Gotta work my way up to help myself some until I can bring myself to actually share my feelings with anyone I see in person.

5- I wash my hands with soap after using a Dettol wipe to clean my phone before cleaning my laptop. Then I wash my hands with soap again before cleaning my desk.  
  
6- I wash my hands again when I accidentally touch the faucet (tap).  
  
7- I spend alot on cleaning product, my housemate also noticed why i showered for a long time and when the water bill arrived, i dont even know how to explain.  
  
8- i feared washing machine \[touching detergent\] and tumble dryer the most, every time after using it i will wash my hand for more than 15 mins. is this normal, when does it consider as clean.  
  
Sometimes, I don't believe that my hands are clean. It's like I forget when to consider my hands clean. Sometimes, I wash my hands or take a shower for more than an hour. I keep washing my hands after touching anything in the bathroom.  
  
These habits prevent me from doing meaningful things. Sometimes, I don't sleep for days because after cleaning something in my room, I go and wash my hands with soap before cleaning the next thing. It takes so much time that I didn't sleep for two nights. Yesterday, I didn't sleep at all because I was cleaning my phone, debit card, and the sink. These habits also prevent me from cooking my own meals. Sometimes, I only eat bread and biscuits for breakfast and skip dinner and lunch. I have also stopped working out because I'm scared that if I touch the carpet, I'll spread all the germs to my housemates. I have lost a lot of weight because of this, and I wake up with anxiety. Sometimes, the first thing I do when I wake up is wash my hands with soap. My hands are so dry that it's hard for me to fully open them without risking injury. There are razor blade-like cuts on my hands, and now my palms feel like plastic. It doesn't feel normal.  
  
When should I stop washing my hands? When are they considered clean? It's so hard for me to deal with this. I have used a lot of patience, and I want to stop this as I spend more time in front of the sink than on my screen. I can't do anything productive in my life. Sometimes, I also stop hanging out with my friends because of this issue, and my friends ask me why I suddenly disappeared, and I have to come up with fake excuses. I want to stop this before it gets worse.

Why are EVERYONE so fake and awful nowadays? I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore.,56,0.94,"Let me explain. I’m a 22 year old female, and I’ve learned so much recently. My entire life I’ve been very naive, and assumed everyone had good intentions. I have adhd, and I speak my mind, and thought most people did that too. I met a lot of men (and women later) who treated me very badly, and I would always ignore it and blame myself. I had a job working only with females, and I’ve never been close to fake people (that I knew of), so a lot of bad situations happened. They would talk badly about me behind my back, excluding me, making fun of me, using me as a target. Looking back I met/attracted those people because I had no boundaries, didn’t speak up, self-blamed and had very low self esteem. People always treated me badly because I let them. I learned a lot about myself and got a lot of self awareness.

My point is, people started telling me I had to understand that most people lie, are fake, and only act from selfishness and that’s just how the average human brain works. I get so disappointed in humanity, if that’s how most of the people in the world acts. Every time I met someone (usually men) I legitimately thought was nice, they would end up being an asshole after a few months. Proving my point every time. I now have to try to distant myself in my mind, from the new people I meet, because they always end up disappointing me. I would attach myself way too quickly to people in the past, legitimately caring for them, and they never gave a shit about me. 

If you think about how much awful shit, humans have been/are capable of doing (war, torture etc), it’s so scary. Are most humans just naturally bad people? Doing those extremely evil acts, and more “normalized” behaviour like abuse, harassment, lying, cheating, manipulation etc. Is the really how the average brain works?

How am I supposed to navigate in a society with liars, manipulators and fake people? It’s very discouraging and sad. It’s not possible that ALL of the people I’ve met coincidentally were the few bad ones. I’ve gone from naive and unknowing, to kind of cynical. «treat people they way you want to be treated” is apparently outdated. If you’re kind and trusting, you’ll get taking advantage of.

How common is to keep living just so you won't hurt those close to you?,49,0.99,"Hi! I hope this doesn't sound tragic, it is a very honest and sincere conversation.

Then, I grew up and I just confirmed my childhood perception. Honestly, it is definitely not an experience that is worth it. Not only that, but I see no rational reason to believe that in the future this will be better, specially considering how things are going in the world right now. However, I would not be able to adopt *the drastic solution* because I feel that would be an immense pain to those who love me.

I returned today at 3:30 with a fresh pair of underwear, but apparently they only do visiting hour 3:30-4:30 on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I drove over an hour to get there and I just wanted to give him a hug. I didn’t realize how important it was to me until I lost it, and then I snapped in the car.

Made my therapist cry today.,51,0.92,"Trigger warning for mild domestic violence. 

My inclination here is to make some stupid joke about how I won therapy and I'm the therapist now because, that's how I handle tough situations, but that's a different can of worms. There really isn't anything like making a seasoned therapist who's seen it all cry to really put into perspective just how fucked up you are. 

The thing that gets me is that I was just describing my day to day and the mindset I walk through life with. That's my fucking normal. That's the default. That's just my life. And watching her break down and needing to give her a minute really put it into perspective. 

I guess that objectivity is a good thing. One thing that therapy has helped me realize just how much of my mindset was just an assumed normal. That this fucking stormcloud isn't how most people live their lives. I mean we all carry a bag of rocks and if you meet someone that claims to have no baggage they're either lying, not aware of it, or the single most boring human on the planet. But having baggage and normalizing your trauma are not the same thing. 

A good example is that, amoung my other bullshit I was stabbed earlier in life by a partner and my therapist brought it up to explain current behavior patterns and my first thought was ""yeah, but come on. That was years ago..."" A stabbing. My partner coming at me with a fucking knife and here I am putting a time stamp on it like it's expired milk. Like rereading this post I described a fucking stabbing as ""mild"" abuse. I understand that it's a coping mechanism, but jesus christ. I mean she was right though, I was using ""yeah but they didn't stab me"" as an excuse for shitty behavior from current partners.

I've tried to ignore their ideology and beliefs, but it's hard when you're in frequent contact with them. I got so used to being made fun of for my struggles, that I've practically gaslit myself into thinking that my mental health isn't the issue but I am.

Survived Suic Attempt 4 Years Ago. My Scary Experience of What It Was Like,50,1.0,"\*\*Trigger Warning: My Story Includes Suic Attempt\*\*

&#x200B;

Im coming up on 4 years since surviving a pretty brutal attempt on my life, and wanted to share my story, some hope, a little advice, and reflect on what my life looks like now/WHAT I WOULD'VE MISSED OUT ON.

Jan 6, 2020, id been in a dark place for a longgggg time, and was basically a walking time-b\*\*\* waiting to go off.  My alcohol/drug addiction had reached its peak.  The weight of those consequences was so heavy on me, and knowing the weight my struggle put on ALL my family/friends (specifically a divorce i caused) felt unbearable.

&#x200B;

I was numb and at a point where I was spiritually dead.  I didnt feel happy at happy moments, I had no interest in my fav things, usually things that were sad, I felt nothing.... or at least thats what id thought.  reflecting back, they were very painful moments that i refused to acknowledge, or properly grieve. i self medicated, HEAVILY, and felt it would pass.... it didnt.

&#x200B;

All the negative stuff that I had neglected and used substances to mask, piled up like a log jam, and once it clogged, every new negative piled up farther and farther back. I had dealt with none of it, and it got to a point, where even thinking about trying to deal with a decade of emotions felt insurmountable. Id waited too long, this task couldnt be fixed.

&#x200B;

I was out of town on work, and had went for a walk with no particular purpose, but TICK, TICK, TICK, id been looking for a way out for a while. In an unfamiliar town, I had come to a railroad track right as the gates went down, the flashing red, DING DING DING and the screaming horn of a train coming through.

&#x200B;

At this point I had mastered ignoring consequences, to just do what made sense in the moment, to refuse to look ahead at the consequences of my actions; whether a year, a month, or 5mins ahead... i had conditioned myself to be selfish and only in the moment. Nothing had particularly been wrong that day, but a thought came in--- run in front of the train --- and it ends. I did exactly that.

&#x200B;

Initially after my ""accident"", I didnt remember much, its all a blur, with moments hear and there remembered, especially with time, they started to come back.  Here are some early thoughts/moments I can remember in the following days:

&#x200B;

\-Worst pain imagineable. I have a massive concussion, everything is a 10/10 blur, I think I'll never see again.  Both my arms are broken, I learn Ive already had 2 emergency surgeries

\-My left arm is ""OK"" 12 screws, a few plates, and in a cast. My right arm was a massive compound fracture, with several breaks.... they have it in some type of stabilizing brace, where there are screws into my shoulder, upper forearm, and wrist, my arm floating below it ""suspended""

\-I dont know what state Im in (truck driver), Ive been missing from family 2days with no contact. Im as vulnerable as it gets, and there are no family or familiar faces around. ATROCIOUS (cant stress this enough) feeling

\-Im in a pain med and concussion induced fog/swirl.  I dont remember the beginning of this interaction, but a Doctor is in the room with me.  The attempts to save my right arm have not worked, if I dont agree to an amputation, I will die a pretty miserable death.  Basically, my body has rejected the arm, it is dying, and my liver enzymes are growing exponentially, Im rotting to death lol

\-I DO NOT WANT TO DIE, AT ALL. I dont care how tough, nihilistic, depressed, whatevs you are, I had been in a deep state of all those.... Im not ready to leave, and Im scared of the potential for an after-life

\-I agree to the amputation, but the Doctor gives me lukewarm news... its roughly a 50/50 I pull outta this thing, even if they take the arm.  In a whirlwind of heavy news, this is the heaviest news. Im bawling, and I feel alone, the doctor holds my hand, and at that moment it is the greatest human contact imaginable. Crazy how desperate for human affection I was after years of disconnect

\-I dont remember the start of the interaction, but Im laying down, being wheeled to a room for surgery. Im starring at the drop ceiling as it rolls past, I cant see it clearly, I hear nurses talking, I cant make any of it out, and I think how crazy that THIS is the last moments I get, a pure haze.....

\- Im in a huge (or atleast it seems) surgery room... its crazy bright, it feels like a dozen people are in there, everything is a serious tone, im seeing tables with tools on them, the kind from TV, but this is me, and its real, despite how surreal it all is....... anddddddd now Im counting down backwards from 10 inhaling the sleepy gas through the mask. HOLY FUCK, THIS IS ACTUALLY IT, IM SO DUMB

&#x200B;

\--------------------------- The Big Surgery Complete---------------------

&#x200B;

Im heavily sedated, confused, my moms here though.  She cries, I cry, its amazing im here. Again, all this is incredibly cloudy, its like a film thats been cut in random places, then picks up mid scene, think ""Memento"" hahaha

&#x200B;

Im not out of the woods, we'll have to wait and see how my body responds, Ive had atleast 3 (maybe 4?) surgeries.  The nurses are all so sweet, im so happy to be alive. A few of my regulars saw me come in, had some type of interactions with me, and are so happy Ive pulled through.  I need help with everything, but these nurses dont mind at all. Unable to drink, eat, poop, pee, or do any of the bandages or anything at all. I can feel compassion and tenderness in every interaction... i feel like some sort of strange celeb.

&#x200B;

Within a few days, my brain is much better, I have a rapport with all the different nurses and aids, and Im beaming from my soul.  These ppl DO NOT KNOW ME, and they quickly feel like family.  They take care of my every need, and make me laugh and smile, they bring in food from a local restaurant, and keep me company.  Id been in a cold world for so long.  These strangers showed me all the love and compassion and value that I needed medically, but also emotionally. Somehow they not only physically nursed me back to health, but spiritually as well. Like a light switch, I felt my soul turn back on.

&#x200B;

\--------------Out of Hospital-------------

&#x200B;

In the hospital I realized booze and drugs had slowly extinguished my soul, it was a huge part of it, but there was more.  I immediately got into some Narcotics Anonymous meetings..... the same love Id gotten from the medical staff, I got there almost instantly.  My grim, pessimist attitude towards humans, has been eviscerated by a combination of these two groups of strangers.

I jump into counseling.  Another great move, at first it feels forced, but i stuck with it, eventually build some rapport, and 4years later, hes one of my best friends and my counselor.  We've grinded and knocked down a lot together. Ive learned healthy coping mechanisms. Learned to control impulsivity, especially the destructive kind.  Counseling is a wonderful tool, especially if you have a small or no support group initially.

I got a dog! Man dogs will force some love into your life.

Ive acknowledged all my past mistakes. Ive grieved them. Grieved the loss of my arm, my clean date/acci-versary are at 4years come Jan 6th.

Ive reconnected with family, apologized, been forgiven, and made a point to maintain my mental health/sobriety as a point to not be that guy who has a come to Jesus moment, and as soon as the coast is clear..... hits the pavement looking for destruction.

&#x200B;

Looking back, its crazy to me, that all this was the direct result of a split-second decision (sort of, from oversimplified perspective).  I think about what wouldve happened, had I not done that a lot. While im not 'glad i did it', i also wouldnt trade any of this back for my stupid 2nd arm lol ---im the happiest ive ever been in my life, by far, like sooooooo far.  the saddest part of dying wouldnt have just been dying, it truely wouldve been that i missed out on the chance to be happy. Im at peace, I joke/laugh, cry at commercials, tell my family (and friends- to their annoyance) I love them.

If youre reading this and struggling, please dont harden your heart against this story. Please dont miss out. Realize that - YES THIS CANNNN HAPPEN TO YOU, OR WORSE - only you can fix this.  Find any one thing small you can do, and do the shit out of it.... then add another... have uncomfortable conversations telling family whats going on.  Dont lean into the negativity youre feeling

Im 35 and fairly healthy, Ive adjusted physically, i dont think about the amputation much, it doesnt stop me from doing really anything...... Im blessed. I really couldve/shouldve died. I wont Bible beat anyone, but for those curious, spirituality has been a big part of healing

What's the point?,48,0.97,"(TW) When I (29F) was about 15, I decided that if my life hadn't turned around by the time I was 30, I'd end it. I'm 30 in under 2 months and I don't feel like my life has really progressed at all, if anything, I think it might be worse.

My longest relationship was 2 years and that ended about 8 years ago. I had a 4 month relationship just after, but nothing except being used since 🤷🏻‍♀️

My living situation is awful and I can't afford to get out. My landlord ignores me and the two housemates that live above me are nightmares more often than not.

Trying to get a new job so that I can afford to move out is proving difficult and I'm not crazy about how I'm being treated there either!

I lost my mum 3 and a half years ago and I don't feel like I've dealt with it as well as most people would. It still doesn't feel right.
My dad was diagnosed with COPD earlier this year and doesn't seem to be doing great, so I'll probably have to deal with that soon too and I'm not ready.

I honestly can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy, or even okay! I suffer with depression and anxiety, I've had multiple therapists, including bereavement and I still feel like this 🤷🏻‍♀️ I can't afford private therapy or medication and I feel like I'm out of options. I think about my future and it goes nowhere, it just makes me want to cry every time and I'm so done. I've been SH more frequently because it's pretty much the only thing I can do.

Does anyone else know they will eventually commit suicide?,48,0.98,"Hi everyone. I’m a 21 year old male. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for the last 10 years of my life. It all stems from childhood trauma. I’ve been to therapy and a psychiatrist plenty of times. As I’ve grown up I’ve learned to deal with it more and more. Over the last year I dedicated my life to getting better. I got diagnosed with bi Polar depression at the beginning of 2022. I’m on medication for it now and things are going a lot better. I’ve dropped 40lbs over the last 7 months. My mental health has improved, I’m in a great relationship and working a nice and easy job with good income. But for whatever reason I can’t shake the feeling that I will eventually take my own life in a few years. I don’t want to do it now, I’m not actively doing anything to hurt myself or planning anything out. I just know that I deal with derealization and severe existential crisis on daily basis and it’s gotten so intense. I don’t want to be alive for 80 years. I’ve not had the best time living and I’m constantly in a state of hyper awareness anxiety. It sounds horrible but I genuinely don’t even wanna live till 40. My entire life doesn’t feel real. I look back on my childhood and genuinely cannot fathom that it was me. Those memories are me. Thinking back to when I was 3 (my earliest memory) I feel like it was lifetimes ago. It doesn’t feel real. I cant live like this for another 60 years. I’m not sad or like nervous about the future.

My boyfriend is making me feel exhausted.,48,0.94,"Context for my current life. I moved away from home about 7 months ago now right after graduating high-school to be with my boyfriend (Lets call him J). I had been living with a roommate but after a couple months J had a mental health crisis and I had to move him into our apartment because he said he wouldn't be safe if I wasn't with him everyday. I didn't really feel ready for that yet but I obviously didn't want him to hurt himself so I had him move in despite that.


For context on J, he has BPD and Autism. He's undergone a lot of traumas and mental hardships, I completely understand and accept that he feels differently and often times more strongly than I do, and that it is hard for him to manage himself, but I feel completely worn down trying to take care of him.


J likes to go to music shows and venues, that really helps him fulfill his social needs. I'm more introverted, and those sorts or things are usually pretty draining for me. I've expressed this to J but I always end up going with him anyways. J doesn't drive, so I drive him usually around half an hour to go to these shows. I know J has other friends they could plan to go to these with, but ever since I've moved here I've been the person going with him. This is because J doesn't feel comfortable going places without me.  No matter what I don't really have a choice except to accompany J to these shows, because if I don't they won't bother to go with someone else, and they will have a breakdown later.


When J has a breakdown, I am the one who stays with them and makes sure hes safe. These breakdowns can last hours, and he has yelled, insulted, and pushed me (never enough to make me fall or cause harm) during them. These breakdowns are absolutely exhausting and traumatic for me to deal with, so most of my energy goes into preventing them from happening how ever I can. These breakdowns can be caused by a lot of things, some recent examples being


-The house isn't clean enough

-I don't want to be sexual with J at the moment, even though he wants to be

-J is tired

-J is hungry


There's other reasons Js has breakdowns, many of them are reasonable reasons to be upset, stuff like J feeling like im not properly addressing or handling his health (J has epilepsy,  and there are times I could have better handled situations regarding that.)


To make sure J doesn't have a breakdown I basically always have to be on stand by for him at all times. He mostly asks me to do simply tasks like making food, or going to the corner store to get him something. Nothing that really should take much out of me, but the fact that I have to deal with these things immediately and without negotiation whenever he wants is a little stressful. If J asked me to make him food and I said no, he would feel neglected, and probably not eat, which could lead to a breakdown. I just really wish I had my own time and space where I felt like I could just focus on myself.


J and my roommate don't get along because they dated in the past and had some major problems. J doesn't even want to talk to my roommate, which means I'm usually the one medigating between them. J wants to use the TV but roommate is using it? I have to ask to use it on his behalf. Roommate left a mess in the kitchen? I have to bring it up to roomate. 


I feel selfish but I can feel how tired I am. I'm irritable all the time, and I hurt myself pretty often because it's the only way to manage that. My memory is awful, and I feel like I'm in a haze a lot of the time. I don't eat enough anymore, and large aspects of my life are going neglected because I can't muster the energy to deal with them. I'm fucking losing myself, even writing this I realize how much off and robotic I seem but that's all I can be. I've been wanting to write a post like this for a while and I just didn't have the energy until now, and even now I don't have the energy to sound anything but robotic.

Life is great. And I want to die.,47,0.98,"I haven't slept in 36 hours. Cried silently and alone for about half of that time. I'll try to keep it short:

* I am 24F, almost 25, and am Asian, if that helps provide any general cultural context for what's to follow.
* I was diagnosed with major chronic depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, bipolar 2, and ADHD around 21 yrs-old when I finally got health insurance for the first time and sought help. It took that long because my family just never understood what mental health was, let alone seeking professional help/diagnoses, and we went through financial hardships throughout my high school/college years so we wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway.
* Despite being undiagnosed with so many issues and experiencing a wide range of traumas, I grew up relatively well-adjusted, and a star student. I played multiple instruments, I excelled in sports, won medals, graduated high school with a 3.97 GPA, got scholarships into college, and even graduated college at the top of my class as salutatorian in 2021. I have many friends and am part of many social circles.
* My mom, the absolute most loving, supportive, beautiful woman in the world.. was diagnosed with Leukemia in my senior year of college. I'm so thankful she lived long enough to watch me receive my diploma. She died from Leukemia the following year in April 2022. Our entire family was lost without her. I was (and honestly am still) absolutely destroyed by her death. I was her main caretaker for the last few months of her life. I was with her in hospice when she took her last breath.

So here I am. Still grieving. Unemployed since August because I work in the animation industry and I think we all know how *that's* been with the recent strikes.

I don't know. I don't know what to write. I'm just rambling because I'm spiraling. Am I writing a *note?* 

Once I was diagnosed, I did start medications, and kept with them for about the last 2.5 years until my health insurance (provided by my employer) ran out because we were all laid off. I've been off them since August, so if I *did* go through withdrawals, I honestly couldn't tell you because my life has never been stabile enough for me to have a baseline to compare to. I could've been taking sugar pills for all I know, I don't know. Maybe the medications just lessened how extreme the extremes could be, but I know for sure that before, during, and after meds, I have and still always feel depressed, anxious, low energy, low motivation, irritable, self-deprecating, etc, etc. 

But on paper, I'm so successful. To my peers and relatives, I'm a role model. I'm the first descendent born in the US to graduate from college, and as salutatorian. My name can be found in the credits of a very successful TV show. I have an incredible support system through my dad, my brother, my SIL, and my partner. I have a house under my name.

And I want to die. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing brings me any lasting satisfaction. I try to stay social, reach out to friends, go out on dates, and we regularly have family dinners. But everything is just a distracting from the never-ending inner turmoil I'm going through. When I stop moving, when I lay in bed and everything is quiet, all the negatives thoughts come back, and I grieve for my mom. The ""nothing makes me happy"" part has been a thing since high school, well before she died, but it definitely amplified with her passing.

I feel nothing from playing video games and hobbies that I used to love when I was younger. I eat like shit and have become overweight. I feel like a disgusting shell of myself. I hate the way I look in the mirror, and my brain just tells me, ""You let yourself get fat and ugly. You deserve to stay fat and ugly."" even though my family and partner regularly reassure me that I am still beautiful and that my worth isn't tied to my appearance. But I can't help it. I was the ugly kid growing up, then I had a glow up in high school and looked good as hell through college. And then my mom died, so I just stopped taking care of myself. In a similar way, I was a spoiled upperclass kid growing up, then suddenly poor through middle and high school, then back to being very comfortable once the new family business kicked off during my college years, so now I don't even know how to feel about money.

I know I need therapy. I've never had therapy except some crisis counseling I got through my university, but they weren't even licensed therapists yet. They were interns/students still working on their psych degree. I enrolled in obamacare this November, so I should finally have health insurance again starting January 2024, but I don't know if/when I'll find a safe and reliable therapist.

Will I make it to Christmas? Will I make it to New Years? Will I make it to my birthday the following month?

Part of me wants to die, part of me absolutely refuses to put my family through that after having lost Mom, especially to my dad and brother who have shown nothing but love and support for me. Truly, I am so, so, so, lucky.

Which is why I feel even more guilty for feeling this way. Life is so good right now. Our family business is bringing in a comfortable income, and I'm not being rushed or forced to get any menial job that'll likely add to my stress. Everyone gets along and loves one another, and especially love me.

And I still want to die. I've always had it at the back of my mind since middle school. I've never self harmed in ways that would be permanent (cutting, burning, etc), though I did develop an unhealthy coping mechanism of bashing my head/forehead onto walls/tables and digging my nails into my palms.

I'm just.. I don't know. I just sobbed and doomscrolled throughout the night and now it's 9:30 in the morning.

I (19F) think i’m a cocsa victim but i’m not so sure.,49,1.0,"So a couple of months ago i came across a tiktok of a woman discussing “cocsa” and how it’s rarely talked about. I wasn’t sure what that meant at the moment so i looked into it more and it uncovered a memory I locked away in my head.
When I was 6 or 7 my cousins slept over at our apartment and in the morning we decided to play house with my siblings. My cousin who is a year older than me, so at the time either 7 or 8, took charge and assigned everyone roles in the house. He made my 3 siblings and his 1 brother be the children, and him and i be the “mom and dad”. I remember we had a closet with a decent amount of toys in it so we all ended up playing in there. When our siblings left the closet, he urged me to stay in the closet with him. He said mommy and daddy’s have to kiss because that’s what grown ups do, so we did. I dont remember it lasting more than 30 seconds and that’s stretching it. When I left the closet, we heard spongebob begin to play on the tv in the living room and our siblings went running to sit on the couch and watch tv. I remember exclaiming “ooh spongebob!!” and then turning to walk away, but he grabbed my arm and told me to stay and that he thought spongebob was boring. I said okay and sat down with him on the bed and he started kissing me under the blanket. Somehow my curtain rod fell off the window, I still don’t know how it did but it was never really reliable in the first place. That scared me a lot because I knew what we were doing was wrong so I told him I really wanted to watch spongebob. He told me to do one more thing, even typing this right now is making me sick..he made me perform oral s8x on him, but he said just do one lick. Afterwards he kissed me again (still under the blanket) and my dad came in and pulled the blanket off and he grabbed me. my dad pulled me into my moms room where she was sitting with my aunt folding clothes (his mother) and he said out loud “(my name) was in the room kissing damn (his name)” They both got up fast and my aunt went to get him and talk to him in the other room, and my mom talked to me in her room . She asked me why I did it..and my answer was “because he made me do it”
I can’t remember what happened after that, but my cousins left pretty soon.
This whole situation just bothers me constantly. Like, I KNOW i was a child but why didn’t I just leave the room..why did i let him take control over my mind like that? But why did he do it in the first place and why me? and we were so young, does it even count as abuse? I don’t have a relationship with him nowadays, and even in our older kid ages, i still kept my distance from him. I was 11 when I went to his water park birthday party and I remember just not saying a word to him because I was afraid he remembered what happened back then. We were in the lazy river and he caught up to me and he started to speak but before I could let him get another word in, I submerged myself under the water hoping he would be gone when i came back up but he was still there and asked me “remember when we were little , you were always so happy to see me “ and i gave a nod and floated away. Anyways that kind of went off topic but i’ve been thinking about talking to my mom about it but i have no idea how to bring it up or what to say at all. I feel that one incident opened my curiosity up at a really young age to where I began watching porn at the age of 8. Fortunately my mom caught me and introduced me to a game called Roblox that took my mind off the inappropriate thoughts for a while but i eventually started seeking out inappropriate games on roblox for a while and to my surprise there were many. I won’t get into any more details about my current state but I Am no longer interested in watching porn and i would actually rather consider myself being a prude. I even convinced myself i was asexual for a while but i debunked that pretty quickly, despite not being a virg. I just feel so shitty and weird and disgusting for what happened when we were little and i strongly believe that one moment shaped my sex life. Should i mention it to my mom ?

I have a few self-destructive habits so I know starting with this will be good for me.

As of today, I’ve gone completely cold turkey. I’ve downloaded the ‘I am Sober’ app and given away the 5L I had in my room. 

I know this sounds stupid and I’m embarrassed about how much of a problem this is for me. Given it away was incredibly hard (I bought some today), and I genuinely feel so anxious about it. I also feel this overwhelming sadness.

"""They act that way for attention"" makes zero sense to a healthy person.",43,0.96,"I was thinking today and in childhood I had severe depression that manifested in self harm and sewer slide attempts (not sure what gets flagged). I was told I did it for attention and I questioned how much of my problems were ""just"" a cry for attention and how much they were valid feelings. Then I grew up and had friends the same way. Always acting like they're in the trenches even when life seemed ok for them. I heard the same things: ""They just like the attention."" 

I'm now at my peak mental health and happy and content in life and it's all such an obvious crock of shit. Because 1st and foremost, almost all of the people who get labeled like that have VERY clearly fucked mental health. Try to go just one day being a complete downer and draining everyone's energy ""for attention"" and tell me if you feel like a faker by the end of the day. And if you are that way for a lot longer tell me how much attention or even empathy and a listening ear you get. It's a miserable way to be.

Second, why are we demonizing a need for human connection and compassion. Because that's what attention is. Why do we punish people for wanting connection? And wanting it badly enough to harm themselves to achieve it, if not physically, then ABSOLUTELY mentally. These people don't get home, take off their sad face mask they used to fool you into empathy, and throw a pool party. They get home and they replay all the annoyed looks you gave them and all the stupid things they did and continue to be miserable.

No matter what the ""attention-seeking"" behavior is, it's ALWAYS a symptom of something deeper hurting a person. A happy and healthy person doesn't deviate from accepted social norms to gain a spotlight. Ever. Next time you see a person and think ""they want attention."" ask yourself, is that in itself even a bad thing? and why might that person be so desperate for my attention they're willing to embarrass or hurt themselves to get it?

I need help quitting weed for my mental health ,45,0.94,"Hi, 

I’m a 23 year old female and I’ve been smoking weed since 17. It didn’t become a problem until the age of 18 where if I couldn’t get any, I would go absolutely mad until I did. 

I struggle with extreme depression and have recently tried to unalive myself. After this incident I have finally realised what a shit show my life is and want to turn it around. 

I am on route to fixing my mental health and addiction but am struggling to start my journey. I have so many people in my circle that smoke and it’s hard for me to say no when offered.

I don’t have the money to spend but I always find myself spending money on weed rather than essential things like food and bills. When being in debt already it’s the worst feeling in the world. 

My parents and partner cannot stand the fact I smoke and to be honest I can’t stand it either. It’s not who I am. 

I’ve been trying to cut down but it’s just not working and I’ve tried cold turkey in the past but always go back. I’ve come to a conclusion that it impacts my mental health negatively and does me no favours. 

I have also gained a lot of weight from binge eating after smoking and I feel disgusting.

I was date raped 17 years ago,43,0.95,"17 years ago when I was 21, I worked as a shot girl at a nightclub called “Red Squared” in Downtown Detroit. During my shift, my manager (who was a local celebrity in Detroit) wanted to do a shot with me. I believe he roofied me that night ( his girlfriend had a similar experience a week after ). 

I was unable to complete my shift, so his friend took me home. When I woke up that morning, I had no underwear on and a different shirt and could barely remember anything. I did not drink much that night.

I immediately called my parents because I knew something was not right and I was scared. They didn’t really seem to care or help me with the situation. I went to the hospital and it was confirmed that I was raped. 

I filed charges and talked to a detective but ended up not following through with everything. Not sure why, maybe I didn’t have the support back then and I had no self confidence. But looking back, I wish I would have pressed charges. I just blocked everything out of my mind.

I think I’m dying but no one takes me seriously because of my mental illness 16F,53,0.93,"I’ve been sick for 4 years and no one will listen.

At first my parents were worried for me but the doctors kept saying it was anxiety. And I’ve had anxiety attacks and stuff before and this is completely different.

But because the doctors kept saying it and not really doing much my parents believed so too. Even when things are discovered to be wrong they ignore me. Say it’s anxiety and when I am then anxious because they are all saying my issues aren’t real that’s ‘proof’ that it’s all in my head.

The past two weeks tho have been the worst I’ve ever felt. My body seems to be shutting down rapidly.

Breaking up fucking sucks,42,0.94,"We broke up a week ago. I still love her so much but it wasn't working anymore. 

Now I'm stuck yearning for her. The thought of never being able to kiss her again is killing me. Knowing that I'll never hold her or be able to call her mine is tearing me to pieces. 

For a while I thought she was the one. She was it for me. She's the first person who has made me feel like I'm worthy of love and happiness, and I'm so grateful for that, even though that's ultimately what made me realise that we couldn't be together. 

In my past relationships I've stayed despite the relationship making me feel awful. My last one before this caused a SH relapse and I still didn't leave. I didn't think I deserved better. I didn't think I deserved to feel good in a relationship. 

I wish she could've been the one. I know that she's not, but it still feels like part of me is missing without her. 

Part of me wants to go back. This hurts so much it's unbearable. But I know that going back would be more painful in the long run. And as much as it pains me I have to do what's going to be best for me long term. 

It's gonna take me a while to picture my future without her though.

I feel like I've lost everything.,43,1.0,"I've genuinely lost everything

I have done it.

I have made the mistake of laying all my future plans and goals, all my love and affection, all my dreams, all my hopes, everything I ever wanted to achieve on this one person.

She was the biggest support pillar in my life, despite not doing anything. She didn't need to do anything to be that to me. All I needed, was her to just love me and be happy, just enough so she would stay by my side.

But I failed. This wonderful, amazing person, this person I prioritised over everything, lost feelings for me.

She came into my life so willing to love me, and I funked it up. I made so many bad decisions, so many fucking mistakes.

I tried my hardest to fix things, despite feeling her slip away, feeling her slowly drift apart from me, I kept going. 

I truly thought I could make it work.


It's been 3, maybe 4 months of no contact. I've had to try so hard to not contact her, to not send her heartfelt messages, to not send her voice recordings of how much I love her still, because I know she's happier, and I know that she knows how much she means to me.

She just doesn't want to be with me, and I can barely wrap my head around that thought. 
How? How could I have funked up this badly?

Things weren't perfect but I didn't care, all I wanted was for her to be happy with me, and after 3 years of us being together, of ups and downs, I failed.


She was my everything. Now I don't even feel like moving on is an option, despite being forced to. It feels like I've just been left behind by the person I loved most.

Why should I even try and be happy, and achieve goals. Why should I put myself first, after I funked everything up.


I can't even believe that I can be okay without her.

I'm in so much emotional pain that my chest is genuinely hurting, physically. 


My heart wants to crawl back to her, to keep trying everything to be with her, but my mind knows that it won't ever be enough.

There's nothing I can do to make her love me.
And you would think, that that would give me enough closure to move on. But it's just making me feel helpless, lost, scared. 


I've only been surviving by following some instructions from a person that genuinely cares for me: ""take it day by day.""

But it still hurts so much. Each day feels so fucking hard to go through.

I was so okay, so used to loving more, giving more, sacrificing everything for her. I didn't care about that. All I wanted was her to be happy and love me, even half as much as I loved her.

But I failed.

I felt so responsible for her happiness, I just remember how confident she grew into the relationship, and I truly felt like it was my job to keep her always happy and to protect her from harm. But now, now that she's gone and is happier without me, I feel I've failed beyond belief.

And I appreciate a lot when people try to tell me that, if she was truly the one she would have stayed, she would have helped work things out, but how can I genuinely believe that statement, if I wholeheartedly know that it was my mistakes that slowly drove her away? 
It shouldn't have been her responsibility, she gave me another chance, but unfortunately she herself wasn't able to truly love me even after that.

"My family needs help, we don’t know what to do with my brother",42,0.97,"UPDATE: We were able to get a crisis response team to get him to a hospital and get proper help as he was in a bad state when they picked him up. Thank you to everyone who replied with helpful suggestions as these all helped very greatly.


Towards the end of 2021 my brother began to develop depression and anxiety, he was 15 years old at the time. In January of 2022 he broke into my fathers gun safe and told us that he was going to take his life. My parents sent him away to a mental facility for 2 months. Ever since then he has he aggressive outbreaks for 2 years and has been sent to mental facility’s multiple times. Now at the start of 2024 he is at a point where he has completely isolated himself in a extra bedroom of our home. Whenever we would try to approach him he would begin to show aggression. When this first started he would come out a few times a day to use the restroom and to eat and drink water, fast forward to now he hasn’t been coming out at all. He has torn up the room, clawed holes in the bed, ripped off parts of the wall and other things of that nature. He hasn’t come out to eat in a little over 24 hours, nor has he coke to get water. As of yesterday the door was open and my mother saw that there was a large puddle on the bed of urine. My mother asked him about it and she saw that he had completely peed himself. He gave her no response when she asked. She cleaned up the bed and sheets but he refused to take a shower or change his clothes (he has not showered, or changed clothes ever since he started isolating himself). Now to today, my mother went to go check on him due to having worries about him not eating and his urine incident from last night. When she went in the room he was sitting on the edge of the bed shivering and just staring into the distance (keep in mind he has no phone so we don’t know what he is doing in there all day every day). Later she came back into the room to find him standing up with urine rolling down his leg and standing in a puddle of piss. That brings us to now, we don’t know how to get him somewhere (because it is obvious he needs help). He isn’t a harm to himself or others so the police can’t help and we know for sure he will not get in the car to go anywhere. So I am asking for options because he needs help urgently.",mentalhealth,DapperShoe2550,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1agt7wx/my_family_needs_help_we_dont_know_what_to_do_with/,19,43.29896907216495,1.298969072164951,9.230733119329776e-05,"['update', 'able', 'get', 'crisis', 'response', 'team', 'get', 'hospital', 'get', 'proper', 'help', 'bad', 'state', 'picked', 'thank', 'everyone', 'replied', 'helpful', 'suggestion', 'helped', 'greatly', 'towards', 'end', 'brother', 'began', 'develop', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'year', 'old', 'time', 'january', 'broke', 'father', 'gun', 'safe', 'told', 'u', 'going', 'take', 'life', 'parent', 'sent', 'away', 'mental', 'facility', 'month', 'ever', 'since', 'aggressive', 'outbreak', 'year', 'sent', 'mental', 'facility', 'multiple', 'time', 'start', 'point', 'completely', 'isolated', 'extra', 'bedroom', 'home', 'whenever', 'would', 'try', 'approach', 'would', 'begin', 'show', 'aggression', 'first', 'started', 'would', 'come', 'time', 'day', 'use', 'restroom', 'eat', 'drink', 'water', 'fast', 'forward', 'coming', 'torn', 'room', 'clawed', 'hole', 'bed', 'ripped', 'part', 'wall', 'thing', 'nature', 'come', 'eat', 'little', 'hour', 'coke', 'get', 'water', 'yesterday', 'door', 'open', 'mother', 'saw', 'large', 'puddle', 'bed', 'urine', 'mother', 'asked', 'saw', 'completely', 'peed', 'gave', 'response', 'asked', 'cleaned', 'bed', 'sheet', 'refused', 'take', 'shower', 'change', 'clothes', 'showered', 'changed', 'clothes', 'ever', 'since', 'started', 'isolating', 'today', 'mother', 'went', 'go', 'check', 'due', 'worry', 'eating', 'urine', 'incident', 'last', 'night', 'went', 'room', 'sitting', 'edge', 'bed', 'shivering', 'staring', 'distance', 'keep', 'mind', 'phone', 'know', 'day', 'every', 'day', 'later', 'came', 'back', 'room', 'find', 'standing', 'urine', 'rolling', 'leg', 'standing', 'puddle', 'piss', 'brings', 'u', 'know', 'get', 'somewhere', 'obvious', 'need', 'help', 'harm', 'others', 'police', 'help', 'know', 'sure', 'get', 'car', 'go', 'anywhere', 'asking', 'option', 'need', 'help', 'urgently']","{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.885, 'pos': 0.036, 'compound': -0.9432}",negative

my stepdad passed away a couple days ago. i don’t know what to do with myself. what to do, how to feel. i’m no stranger to losing people but this. this one. i just can’t. i just saw him the day before. we were gonna clean something up the next day. we made plans. he just didn’t make it through the night. 
he was a marine. served 30 years. was honorably discharged, so he left and met my mom. they married, he moved it. i was maybe 4 or 5. i knew this man my whole life. the man i wish was my biological father. but that’s neither here or there. he’s my dad. period. 
the thing that’s weighing on my so much i can’t breathe is how much he confided in me. told me secrets he swore himself he’d never tell anyone. after each talk i felt like i walked away with 200 extra pounds on my shoulders. 
he was a functioning alcoholic. wasn’t one of those angry drunks. 
i found his diaries. seeing what he wrote. his decline, what he was going through. his anxiety and ptsd. he was suffering alone. he didn’t. have to. that damn stubborn man i swear. 
i went on a 4 day trip with my fiancé. i came back and saw him. he looked normal. but he didn’t come out of his room the whole day. 
i went in there and he was a mess. couldn’t control his bowels. shaking uncontrollably. said he was cold. i gave him my blanket. i’ve seen him like that before. it was usually something i could do to fix it. 
not this time. 
me and my mom cleaned him up. he was shitting blood and throwing it up
the look he gave me before the ambulance door closed. oh my god i’ll never forget it. how soft his eyes were. i’d never seen them like that before. 
our dogs won’t eat now. the house is eerily quiet. the sound of his tv not being on now. i can’t even go downstairs and walk without feeling my legs and knees shake. 
the pressure on my mom now. taking over the bills and we’re seeing we can’t afford anything. even if i chipped in my own money, wouldn’t even come close.

HELP ME : I got groomed and sexually assaulted and I don't know if i want to go to court,41,0.88,"I (M14) is friend with a really cool guy well name Ethan i met on valorant 9 months ago. Even though we were online friends, we were really close and basically knew everything about each others irl life. Same with others member of the discord we were on. Ethan had a lot of brothers, but the one im gonna talk about in this post is K (M26). There were rumors about K being a pedo, as he had apparently asked for nudes and threatened to rape a girl that was on the server. It started when she was nine, shes now 16. This girl is no longer on the server cause of arguments.  


So, a few days ago, K dmed me, i instantly thought that was weird cuz why would he dm me THE ONLY MINOR and im also ftm so my voice is girly out of all the other online people. We werent close at all, only talked each other 2 or 3 times. Third message he sent already had sexual connotations, and we kept talking, he was always talking about sex and how people love ""femboys"" like me. I texted Ethan about it, and he go angry at me, saying I had to stop seeing him as a pedo as there were no proofs what the girl, lets call her Eli, said was true. He said this was a normal conversation we could have add cuz we like to do sex jokes. He convinced me, and I felt bad for seing him as a pred, so i kept talking to him like i normally would with anyone.   


The next day, after once again a conversation filled with sex ""jokes"" he asked my insta cuz he wanted to say something private to me. I did, turn out the private thing was that he wanted to jerk off to my ""femboy ass"". Thats when it got fucked up, he started asking for pic and sex calls, threatening me and my family when I refused. He then threatened me even more with these pictures.  


I felt like shit, and didnt know what to do, so I went and did the only thing i could do, I talked to Eli. If this happened to her, she would understand how i felt. I hadnt talked to her for months, and she shared that K was still asking her for things and talking to her. She told me to block him, that he wouldnt do anything since he would be the one in trouble. As stupid as this sounds, this really helped me. I blocked him everywhere, and went to talk to ethan about his brother. He believed me, said he was sorry for not taking me seriously, and banned K from the server so i didnt have to leave. Him and another friend talked to K and Ethan's mom.   


Fast forward to now. K's mom wants to talk about this to their therapist, and talk to me tonight, which i  will gladly do since i feel really bad for this poor woman. The other is telling me I should go and file a complaint, and I agree. (He did this to atleast three other girls without counting eli and I). The thing is Im scared, scared to talk about it to my mom and the police. I know i need to but i just want to never talk about this again. I want to throw up just thinking about it.

How I went from living in hell from a brain injury to healing and living in heaven. ❤️,42,0.98,"My life was absolute hell after I suffered a brain injury from deep sea diving, I can’t even explain the tournament I lived every day. I was diagnosed with countless serious mental illnesses, I didn’t know that kind of pain existed here on earth.

I have lived in hell. I planned my end and went to do it. I was moments away from doing it. Then I had a thought about my dear mother grieving me ending my own life, it stopped me in my tracks.

I decided to dedicate my life getting better. That was 10 years ago. If I ended it that day, I wouldn’t have experienced the best 10 years of my life. Since that day I have married my dream wife, had a beautiful baby boy, followed my wildest childhood dreams to make ocean documentaries and made and starred in a Disney series, bought my first home, travelled the world, made beautiful friendships and most importantly of all I am now stronger mentally and physically than I have ever been, and it’s all thanks to going through the hell of what I went through mentally after my brain injury.

There’s no way you have tried everything because there are limitless possibilities of ways you can get better. Keep trying! You have the strength of thousands of years of your ancestors. Visualise getting better. This storm is here to make you a warrior. All the most beautiful and powerful people on this earth have been through hell.

Desperate Help. My younger sister (16F) is ruining her life slowly.,40,0.91,"Just for some background. I am a 20yo young man and live with my parents go to school and work a job, my Father is a hard worker that is working countless nights trucking for the family but usually isnt around due to his working. My mother raises the other 4 children in my family on her own and works at a daycare on the weekends. Our family was never wealthy but we always had just enough to get buy.

&#x200B;

Now as for my sister lets just call her Jessica, she has always been an anti-social type, she never really had many friends, and she spends most her days in her room drawing. Aside from that, she would eat with the family and didnt cause problems.

This past year however, Jessica has gotten progressively worse; nowadays she completely neglects herself and her surroundings, does not ever interact with family, she does not eat any food except for barbecue chips and coke and says every other food is dirty, she will barely sleep, she even developed something in her mind that everything is dirty and will spend hours in the bathroom trying to ""clean"" something even if it was never dirty to begin with.

She refuses to sleep on her bed because its ""dirty"", she refuses to even open a door without having a napkin covering the handle. Whenever, shes confronted by Mom or Dad for this she just has an emotional breakdown and never changes her ways.

I feel horrible for my mother, she deals with her problems everyday Jessica has made her cry because my mother just doesnt know what to do with her as it seems like it gets worse for Jessica by the day.

&#x200B;

Our family does not understand her problem, we desperately need help/information on how we can fix this and get Jessica back to living a life that is not miserable and self-harming to herself.

Took adderall and don’t know what to do,41,0.94,"Hello,

So I recently had an exam I was not ready for at all - did not study due to personal issue but the day before the exam at about 9pm. I got some adderall from a friend and took it (it says 30 on it so I’m guessing 30mg)

I have trouble focusing and staying productive - always end up really distracted or incapable of retaining anything i study but Jesus I took that pill and by 2am I had memorized and understood every concept I needed for the exam. 

I studied the anatomy of the ear, and about 5 chapters worth of work, which usually would have taken me weeks.

I’ve taken it again today

I scored a 98 on the exam and I’m trying to convince myself to not take it again because of everything I’ve read about it, but why? Why should I not? I’ve never felt more alive. My friends say I look better, I’m speaking more fluently/confidently. I feel more confident, I drive better, I see more, I feel like I’ve been looking at the world and it’s so dull but not anymore, i finally want to leave my room, talk to people, look at the goddamn grass and smell some dogshit while I walk in the park. I feel f*cking powerful.

I don’t feel the need to eat so much to make myself feel better, I feel in control of my actions.

Is it pathetic that I still have mental breakdowns at age 25?,40,0.85,"I’ve always had mental breakdowns, I figured maybe I’ll grow out of them one day but it doesn’t seem to be the case. 

I feel pathetic because my parents witness me having them. Which mainly is me just crying uncontrollably and trying to stay away from others/hide it, but I’m not good at hiding crying. 

I want to hide it because everyone always asks “can I do anything to help” which the last thing I want when this is happening is any sort of attention. I cannot think rationally when I’m in this state, so verbalizing my needs doesn’t work, I just shut everybody out because I’m not thinking straight. 

And yes I’ve been in therapy most of my life, but haven’t needed it in a year or so. I don’t think therapy will help in this situation as I’ve tried it before and didn’t help long term and hardly short term. 

I know what I need and it’s to cry it out, crying is my bodies way of releasing stress (and humans in general but most don’t let themselves cry which sounds awful). But regardless it makes me feel down in the dumps as I’m crying, but after I often feel relief. I guess I just have to live with it.

I’ve been told by my brother growing up that my crying is “pathetic” so I think I internalized that opinion of his and now believe everyone views crying as pathetic. I just hate to be a bother to others.

You won't feel so defeated or worthless, or like you don't mean anything. You do mean something and you need to be here. You are just as important as everyone else. You are worth it. You deserve so much better and if you can hold on just a little while longer you will get better and better. You aren't alone in this, even though it feels like it. I care. I want you to be here. I need you here. You are not alone. You are not making it up, you aren't trying to get attention. your feelings are real but they aren't all true. You should be here. You will get through this, and you are loved. Anyone who doesn't think so can f\*ck off.

I just don’t want to be sad anymore,42,1.0,"One day I woke up and took a look at my life and I realized how much I hated it. One random day I just stopped being happy, at first I had so many passions and interests. I wanted to have a career and loved learning about it and learning in general. I’m 15 and for about 3 months now I’ve lost my passion in anything and everything I care about, I dropped a whole 1k on a fucking guitar and I can’t even bring myself to practice it. And then there’s art which I’ve devoted myself to for a whole year and I still draw worse then the girl I liked in 4th grade. I’ve started taking sleeping pills so I don’t have to lay awake at night thinking anymore. At first I didn’t need them but now I can’t sleep without them. One night I decided not to take one and I had the worst realization in my life. I laid awake sobbing for 30 minutes at least holding my pillow out of loneliness. I just wanted anyone to love me, to talk to. I was so desperate for anything. My life’s on a downward spiral, I’ve given up on school from a straight A student to barely passing and all my hobbies i once had are now gone along with any passion for them. I wasn’t worried about killing myself because I’m too much of a coward but lately it’s begun to look a lot closer then I thought. I’ll randomly have depressive episodes throughout the day which bums everyone out around me and stops whatever I was doing while I rant or moan about some mild inconvenience. I’m so tired of life already and it hasn’t even begun. I doubt I could live another year let alone 40. Is there anyway I can make it stop? I’ll take anything at this point as long as I can stop feeling this way

I recently found out I'm not ok.,39,0.94,"*I'm not sure if that's the right flair. This is more of a vent*

I don’t remember much of anything from 0-8 years old.
During that time, my parents filed for bankruptcy, my mom worked nights, my dad got let go and no one was hiring, we had 6 people living in a >2 bedroom apartment/house (we kept moving). 

I went to cbt therapy for 2 years for my OCD. This year I started talking therapy. I was telling him about my life and how I was always considered the golden child, and he asked me ""why?"". ""Because I was a good child? I did my school work without complaining, I never spoke unless spoken to,, I went to bed right after dinner...""
He interrupted ""why?"". ""Because that is what good kids do, and I'm a good kid?"" He asked ""why did you want to be a good kid?"". ""Because bad kids get in trouble, and I'm not a bad kid."" He asked ""what happened when you got in trouble?"". I froze, this conversation had seemed pointless to me but I suddenly felt like I couldn't speak, my eyes started watering, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. ""Nothing"" I said, ""then why are you shaking?"" He replied. ""I don't know"".. ""did he hit you? Did your father hit you if you got your homework wrong, if you didn't go to bed after dinner, if you spoke to much? Is that why?"" ""I don't know. He didn't hit me. I dont remember him hitting me, only yelling quietly."" ""he didn't? ""I don't know""

After that we talked about things I didn't know I didn't want to talk about. 

The week after we talked about phobias. ""What are you afraid of?"". I didn't even need to think. ""Buzzing big ass bugs, the dark, and not being able to speak."". ""Why?"", ""because my sister trapped me in the wasp infested pantry and turned off the light. I was too scared to scream. My eyes were pouring alligator tears but I was too scared to breath."" ""Oh."" He said. ""Did she do anything else to you?"". I had to think, but the more I remembered the less good I felt. My sister had bit, choked, kicked, hit me, cut my hair.. ""one time we were playing pizzeria and I was the pizza. She took my mom's fabric cutter that looks like a pizza cutter and ran it over my bad. My favorite purple shirt was stained that day. (I joked). I thought it was a silly story. He asked, ""you cared more about a shirt than your body?""...""you don't understand, it was my favorite shirt.""

Next session we talked about whatever I wanted.

He asked me what the scares on my arms were from.  ""I don't self harm if that's what your getting at. I work in a kitchen, you get burned in a kitchen."" ""What's that one from"" (pointing at the biggest one) ""it was a cooked to order item and I was afraid I was going to drop it so I put my hand underneath. All the hot grease was dripping onto my arm."" ""Did it hurt?"" ""Of course it did its 400° grease straight off the grill."" ""Couldn't you have used a plate?"" ""I could've but it would had taken extra time to grab a plate plus then I'd have a dirty plate."" He said ""a dirty plate is worth more than your body, you care more about a purple shirt than your body. Why don't you care?"".. ""it was my favorite shirt, and I think the scares look cool."" ""Why do you like being hurt? You're harming yourself and lying saying your not.""

I'm quitting therapy, I didn't like that. I didn't like how scared I felt, i didn't like anything about it.

my dad is gone and i feel so empty,41,0.96,"this summer i lost my dad. he died totally unexpectedly in his sleep. this has been 6 months now and it feels like living hell. this last semester of school felt impossible. i started going through old videos on my phone just to try to find his voice to hear it again. and all i could find was little snippets and it makes me miss him so much. having to be at home for christmas break is torture. i have to be in this house which is now so empty. i have to look at the room he slept in. i have to walk through the room he always worked from home in. i have to live in my room which is the last place i ever saw him. i have to see his truck in the driveway, and it gives me a fleeting moment of calm, comfort, and safety. but in fractions of a second the feeling is ripped away. ive never wanted to just somehow be able to bottle a feeling up and be able to keep it. my mom wanting to stop running the central air conditioning system in the house, because so few rooms in the house get used now. because its so empty. the house is so empty now.  
  
ive never had a christmas that i just experience so little excitement about. its horrible. christmas day has never felt so empty. such a lack of joy. my mom could tell i was bothered and told me to go take my antidepressants. it just makes me feel even more so that im just a burden. no one wants to be around me unless im medicated.  
  
that may have come out of nowhere but i struggled with thoughts like that even before my dad passed away. for a number of reasons, some known and some not, i have felt unlovable, unloved, and unworthy for a couple years now. ive gone to therapy both before and after this summer. and now that the only person who i feel like would ever actually love me unconditionally is now gone. i feel like i have no one who really cares about me. much less anyone who loves me or enjoys my company. maybe this is selfish but on christmas day the only person who reached out to me at all was my ex who i am no contact with right now. the only person that might even pretend to care is her.  
and i even get doubts now that my dad was even proud of me, or loved me as much as my other siblings. i know logically that he really did love me but i'll have meltdowns where all i can feel like is a failure and disappointment and worthless to everyone, including my dad. i cried over an internet stranger saying ""your dad is proud of you"" who was consoling someone else who had lost their dad. i have no idea why i think he isnt proud of me. i've noticed i have problems where i feel like i have to earn my love.

Like when you have an overly controlling person, someone having an episode, etc.

All are results of mental instability. But people won't hesitate to write ""*boo, parents didn't hug you enough as a child?*"" and other hurtful things.

Proof that it's getting worse: ""Karen"" jokes and videos are very popular and Karens are hated. But being a Karen is just a result of growing up with overly contolling parents.

Why do grades matter so much?,40,0.95,"I'm in 10th grade right now and my grades are getting worse and worse and I feel like I have no vision for my future.
Everyone treasures grades so much, my mom, my classmates, teachers (etc.) and it determines so much, where I go after school what I can study, where I get my job.
But I don't really understand why they determine someone's worth so much, if you don't have good grades your future is basically f*cked, even though something as vague as the future is incredibly undetermined in itself.
You could have great talents in art, music, sports, whatever, but if it's not studying it doesn't matter.
I usually prefer to go the more fun way, if there were two projects I could chose from, chances are I'm taking the more entertaining one, even if it pulls my grades down. But people around me care about them so much, it makes me feel like a disappointment even though I'm just doing what interests me.

My teacher made a self harm joke.,65,0.83,"I made another post a few minutes ago but here's another one. This one is a rant with no real purpose.

My teacher made a self harm joke. Of course she didn't know that I self harm but I don't think that justifies it at all. Let's call her Mrs. Marina because that's almost her name. English class. We're doing work at tables of about four people. Mrs. Marina sat down to speak with me personally about my assignment. I needed help with it but it turned into a conversation between me, her and the two other students at my table. She had some scrapes on her arm and then held her arm up and told us that she had been scrabbed by some tree branches and that we shouldn't worry because she's ""not some little emo boy who..."" and then gestured in a wrist-cutting type motion. It was an awful thing to hear from a teacher I had actually liked. But seeing the other two boys laugh I had to force a laugh of my own. Hearing something I struggle with be referred to in such a degrading, belittling way by somebody who is supposed to be protective and caring or whatever was just weird. It really rubbed me wrong but I couldn't really voice those thoughts to my friends or another teacher afterwards because then they might assume I self harm, which I do. It all just seemed fucked up to me and it bothers me that she got away with it because I didn't say anything.

Disgusted by my own boyfriend,38,0.87,"Hi, I found out two days ago that my boyfriend is addicted to porn. I found his secret reddit profile online and saw that he posted his genitals, chatted with several girls, sent them videos of him coming, commented extremely disgusting things (in my opinion at least). He is now doing it a year behind my back. I wouldn't say our sex life was dead, I had just gone through a lot the last months so I wasn't feeling it that much. But it was never dead. I moved to a different continent with him, so I don't have anywhere else to go. I am deeply hurt, insecure about my body, depressed and shocked. I don't know what to do, I never loved someone more than him. He never hurt me ever before. But this is too much. I am so grossed out when I look at him and thinking about his disgusting thoughts make me so angry. He now commited to doing therapy, but I don't believe that he will ever stop having the urge to get attention from other women. I am about to book a flight back home, but change is scary. Help..

My partner microcheated on me,40,0.72,"My partner (39M) has routinely microcheated on me (40f) - be it through reaching out to a woman on LinkedIn to tell her she was beautiful and ""a rare combination of brains and beauty"" after saying the same to me... after we were ""exclusive"" and I had celebrated holidays with his family or set up Christmas decor at his house and we'd established exclusivity to cam girls to porn to talking to exes and random blasts from the past behind my back or gaslighting me to make me feel guilty for calling out the behavior. We've conceived a child and miscarried and I spent a sum of money on IVF to harvest embryos with him. We just bought a home together. Things have been good for a few months but he'd been looking up an ex without contact every few weeks, saying it meant nothing beyond determining whether he'd been in the right to break up with her.


Upon contemplating moving in, I reached out to the common LinkedIn connection that appeared to have no link to him. This was when she revealed he'd hit on her a year ago after we were exclusive. I had someone monitor his account and he turned out to have been talking to and peering at many other women before and while we were together. I finally admitted the latter part to him after he struggled to apologize tonight. I am struggling with the fact that he's a dismissive avoidant and feels shame but has been good to me (mostly) for a few months until tonight. I am afraid and he is being quite cold and blaming me for investigating more before I commit my life and finances to him. Advice appreciated.

What should I do?

Side note: he claims it was common flattery to get a connection, which I've never had to use. He's angry I had someone look, and he keeps trying to make me feel bad for bringing this up. He says I'm the only woman he's ever done this to, which is an awful feeling a year and a half into a relationship.

First 24 years of my life were miserable and not worth it. Why should I recover?,37,0.91,"
5 more decades of this crap? Hell nah. I'm so tired. I don't want to experience anything anymore. I don't like waking up, or going to cafes, or playing video games, let alone taking showers, eating, cleaning, cooking. I hate it all. 

I tried so hard to recover. So much. Therapy, meds, meditation, exercise, friends, family, fulfilling career, alternative meds, whatever. Most times when I sought help, it wasn't available.


I just don't see why I should go on when I'm just already so tired. Even if I recover, the first quarter of my life has been hell, and it's been irredeemable. I can't ever imagine enjoying life. Whatever I have, even if I was rich and famous and lived in a huge mansion with everything I could ever want, I'll never forgive this universe for creating me. 

I have no reason to go on. Whatever sadness anyone in my life will face won't really make them as miserable as I am. Oh they'll miss me? They'll be sad?

What are the worst/best things a therapist could do?,38,1.0,"I am new therapist who has just started to see clients. As someone who has went to therapy before, I have some understanding of what I like/don't like about a therapist. However, when you are the one in the therapists chair it can be extremely intimidating. You are taught to give therapy a certain way in school, and I want to make sure I'm making my clients feel good rather than strictly follow the books.   


To anyone who has been in therapy, what are the worst/best things a therapist could do during your session? Okay maybe not THE worst thing that any good professional would never do anyways, but things that rub you the wrong way. For example, when I was in CBT therapy it would bother me when a therapist would jump straight into behavioral work before letting me fully express why things made me upset/anxious. Knowing this, I feel out when the right time is to start behavioral work to ensure they vented out all their frustrations first.

Everyone has made it clear my life is better without me in it and I'm close to just giving it all up,37,0.88,"Sorry, I just need to vent. I don't have any friends or family I can talk to, so this is the next best thing. 

Basically long story short, it has been relayed to me over and over again how I'm a awful partner and parent. I'm sure my past posts can clear all of this up, but I'm am constantly letting my child and their father down. They thrive without me, and ""bf"" has told me he's happier when I'm not around and he hopes he doesn't go first because I have been so lackluster as a parent that our child is going to suffer. My child is even bringing up now I haven't done certain things on her own so I know a custody lawyer would give custody to the dad. 

Now I can't even do anything correctly at my job,  a star employee now reprimanded weekly and I've called out more in the past few months than I have in the five years ive been with the company due to mental health. Unfortunately I can't take a leave of absence because it's unpaid, and I have a child and bills to take care of. Calling out too much takes me out of the running for a promotion I've been working on for three years.

Was I sexually abused by my aunt?,39,0.7,At 3yrs 10 and a half months my aunt made a film of me naked on a bed she then told me to my naked dance which I proceeded to do then I hid under the blanket and my butt was sticking out and she said in the creepiest way on the video what a cute ass and then you can hear my mom telling her to stop. Hadn't thought about this until a couple years ago. My mom told me it was just childish play and so it was okay but it made me largely uncomfortable as a child when I found the film. I was like six when I found it maybe. Well finally told my therapist about it the other day decided to go dig through the old family movies and guess what I found... I feel like it's inappropriate that's what my therapist said at the least. I'm just like is this abuse though? I don't really remember it but watching it makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and angry that something like that would happen to me and my mom would let it happen and defend the person who did it. Was this just a normal thing like my mom said? Filming a nearly 4-year-old playing around naked and commenting on it and encouraging him to do so? For context both my mom and her sister were sexually abused as children which makes me think this is either an extreme lack of boundaries or them carrying their abuse on to me. I want to go public about this abuse but I'm worried I'm just going to get minimized like I was by my mom when I found it when I was a kid and said it was wrong and disturbing but I didn't really have the words to explain it then or the understanding I do now as an adult.

I've likely had an ischematic stroke at the age of 12. I've not been the same since.,36,0.92,"When I was 12, I remember a day in my life that made me feel like I was dying. I woke up for school, my face felt numb and my arms were very floppy. I managed to get myself to the living room and my mum made me toast and some tea. So I grabbed a fork, dipped it in the tea and put it on my face. I was confused. Why was there no toast in my mouth? Moreover, why can't I control my arm? 

My mum thought I was clowning around and asked me what I'm doing. I tried to say something but my tongue was so numb, all I could make were noises with no words. 

A few minutes went by and my whole body went numb, but that numbeness felt like a burning pain. I couldn't walk at this point. I managed to tell my mum that I can't go to school today. Through my numb tongue, I had to speak slowly. It was difficult but at that point I realised I'm not just sick. I thought I was dying. 

At that point my mum started to panic and called the emergency services. I collapsed on the floor, fading in and out of consciousness. Every second felt like a thousand eternities. I began to believe I made my whole life up. Every second I wanted to die rather than endure this. My body felt like it was in a washing machine. I couldn't lift my arms or legs. When I was conscious, I'd scream for hours and hours (probably more like minutes). Nothing felt real. 

I don't remember what the paramedics did, my mum said they tested whether my pupils would dialate and constrict. My pupils were dialated and wouldn't respond to light. Though the thing that bothers me most is that while I buried this incident deep in my mind, I asked my mum about this incident 7 years after. 

 I study neuroscience and even before that I was a huge science nerd so when I learnt about the symptoms of a stroke in detail, I immediately got a panic attack, I felt like I was dying once again, I collapsed on the floor crying and screaming once again.  My arms went floppy without that numb feeling, but I felt just as helpless.

When I asked my mum about what happened, she told me they did some tests on me but they accused me of being on drugs. I was 12 and didn't even take a sip of alcohol. Who looks at a 12 year old, unable to speak, unable to move, on the floor, pupils not responding to light and accuses them of doing drugs? 

I just feel... Alone since then. Whenever my body has any sort of medical issue, I begin to hate myself, feel like it's my fault. I feel like nobody would care if I died.

Freshman year of HS Covid hit and like most other teens of this era it affected her social life and maturity. She came through and seemed to find her people through singing and theater and her grades improved. She had a pretty decent group of friends, never a best friend though. 
College so far has been a very rough road. She’s far from home, with no friends or acquaintances nearby. She made a group of friends early on in the first semester and they literally dropped her, icing her out of the group entirely while posting on snap all of their get togethers without her (social media 😡). She was very down about it and I had no idea how to help her. 
Now here’s the reason I’m posting. I obviously love my daughter more than anything. But I am concerned that her personality is putting people off. She is very emotionally immature, never wants to talk about anything real, can’t/wont talk about her feelings, never shows interest in others feelings. It’s like she has no emotion at all. She’s also put on a lot of weight (well beyond the freshman 15) and eats nothing but crap, never exercises and stares at her phone all day. You can imagine the eye rolling I get when I try to suggest anything changing in that arena. I know she’s depressed. I asked her if she was and her reaction was a nervous smile and a shrug, very typical of her. 
What can I do to help her?  I suggested therapy and got the smile/shrug again. If she’s not open to it I doubt it will help. It’s so hard because she’s now technically an adult and I can’t consult with her doctor anymore.",mentalhealth,Ambitious_Heat1804,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/18x4549/so_concerned_about_my_daughter/,30,36.0,0.0,7.674695250642756e-05,"['daughter', 'college', 'freshman', 'ups', 'down', 'year', 'lately', 'seems', 'downward', 'spiral', 'grade', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'year', 'developed', 'trichotillomania', 'sp', 'tried', 'get', 'help', 'therapy', 'helped', 'little', 'least', 'extent', 'slowed', 'eventually', 'stopped', 'got', 'bad', 'bald', 'spot', 'freshman', 'year', 'h', 'covid', 'hit', 'like', 'teen', 'era', 'affected', 'social', 'life', 'maturity', 'came', 'seemed', 'find', 'people', 'singing', 'theater', 'grade', 'improved', 'pretty', 'decent', 'group', 'friend', 'never', 'best', 'friend', 'though', 'college', 'far', 'rough', 'road', 'far', 'home', 'friend', 'acquaintance', 'nearby', 'made', 'group', 'friend', 'early', 'first', 'semester', 'literally', 'dropped', 'icing', 'group', 'entirely', 'posting', 'snap', 'get', 'togethers', 'without', 'social', 'medium', 'idea', 'help', 'reason', 'posting', 'obviously', 'love', 'daughter', 'anything', 'concerned', 'personality', 'putting', 'people', 'emotionally', 'immature', 'never', 'want', 'talk', 'anything', 'real', 'talk', 'feeling', 'never', 'show', 'interest', 'others', 'feeling', 'like', 'emotion', 'also', 'put', 'lot', 'weight', 'well', 'beyond', 'freshman', 'eats', 'nothing', 'crap', 'never', 'exercise', 'stare', 'phone', 'day', 'imagine', 'eye', 'rolling', 'get', 'try', 'suggest', 'anything', 'changing', 'arena', 'know', 'depressed', 'asked', 'reaction', 'nervous', 'smile', 'shrug', 'typical', 'help', 'suggested', 'therapy', 'got', 'open', 'doubt', 'help', 'hard', 'technically', 'adult', 'consult', 'doctor', 'anymore']","{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.92}",positive

What can I say/do to help my stuck-in-a-rut depressed boyfriend?,36,0.93," (Apologies for grammatical mistakes, I’m not a native English speaker. Thank you for taking the time to read tho)

We are doing long distance, and have been together for three years. 

It’s been really rough for him in his own life (family issues that turned monetary) during that time, and this year and last month it’s been at the lowest it feels like. 

He desperately needs a job to finish school, but he hasn’t gotten a single positive response in months and can’t afford to do much besides staying at home. 

I don’t want to seem like I want to “fix” him a) because he is not broken. Broke yes but no broken, and b) because only him can change his life for the better. 

But can I say or do to help him cope with anxiety and depression? And the feeling of defeated and failure?

# Howdy!

As some members have pointed out; June is Men's Mental Health Month!  
Yes, it's also pride month this month. And for those who are wondering when the Women's Mental Health Months was, that is in May (may vary per country).  



**Why is discussing Men's Mental Health so important?**    
Mental disorders affect men and women. The prevalence of several mental disorders is lower in men than in women. However, other disorders are diagnosed at comparable rates for men and women or at higher rates for men, like [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#part_2549). Men are also more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm).

Certain symptoms may also be more common in men than women, and the course of illness can be affected by a person’s sex. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.

Men are less likely to have received mental health treatment than women in the past year. Recognizing the signs that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting treatment. The earlier that treatment begins, the more effective it can be.

But mainly, and that is what we have been seeing here on r/mentalhealth a lot: people assume that men don't struggle simply because **they are often portrayed, or expected, to be strong and silent**. This expectation is rooted in toxic masculinity and has resulted in poor mental health outcomes for men.

A [research](https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/40-of-men-wont-talk-to-anyone-about-their-mental-health#:~:text=77%25%20of%20men%20polled%20have,negative%20stigma%22%20on%20the%20issue) has shown that: 

* **77% of men** polled have suffered with symptoms of common mental health conditions such as anxiety, stress or depression.
* **40% of men have never spoken to anyone about their mental health.**
* **29%** of those say they are ""too embarrassed"" to speak about it, while 20% say there is a ""negative stigma"" on the issue.
* **40% of men** polled said it would take thoughts of suicide or self-harm to compel them to get professional help.  

    
That last one is alarming, this means that the majority of men will not seek professional help when they struggle with suicidal or self harm thoughts! Men don't talk about their issues and often think: 'I’ve learnt to deal with it', 'I don’t wish to be a burden to anyone' or ‘I have no-one to talk to’. We hope r/mentalhealth will offer you a safe place where you anonymously can share your story. While we are on the topic of being anonymous, it is totally okay to create a new Reddit account and post here on that alt account!

77% of men polled said they experienced some level of symptoms for common mental health problems such as anxiety, stress or depression.

But what underlying factors are driving those symptoms? Respondents were asked about the biggest causes of pressure in their life - pressures that might negatively impact their mental health.

The top three issues were:

* Work-related pressure - 32%
* Financial pressures at - 31%
* Health concerns - 23%

Is this something you recognize?

So what is? As with all complex healthcare issues, there is no easy answer when it comes to redressing the disparities in access to formal support for people of color and those from other diverse ethnic backgrounds. Nevertheless, where there is a will, there is a way!    
  
If you are struggling, it would be helpful to visit your local healthcare provider. But doing that can be scary.  
You might feel that they won't listen or are able to understand. Or you might struggling to put into words how you feel. In both cases, this [article](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/tips-for-talking-with-your-health-care-provider), will give you some tips and tools on how to talk to your primary care provider. You deserve to be seen and heard!

r/mentalhealth is a peer to peer support subreddit. Please share in the comments what has helped you!  
This can be a podcast/music/a video/a book/an article or an app (yes we will screen them for promotions).   
Or you are more than welcome to share your story on how you approached getting help IRL. Was it as difficult as you maybe thought. Would you do something different? What was the response you have gotten after asking for help? 

And if you need help, please let us know what you are dealing with. So others can give you some tips on what worked for them. Or maybe they recognize themselves in your story! 

Aside from awareness, we hope this can spark a conversation on the topic. Because conversations and connecting with eachother is what we are all about.

"Warning regarding DM's and chatgroups offering ""help"".",33,0.98,"**Hello!**

  
Our team has seen an influx of accounts promoting help via DM, whatsapp/telegram/discord groups or other social media outlets. 

  
**We do not endorse these** and remove as much as we can. Simply because we do not know who is offering help and what their credentials and intentions are. Unfortunately, many of these actors participate in bad faith and for personal (financial) gain.

Is this has happend to you, you can report the DM to Reddit admins and block the user. If you want, you can also shoot us a message via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/mentalhealth), so we can take action too. Keep in mind that when we ban a user, it does not stop them from DM'ing others.

Just wanted to share my life ,13,0.93,"English is not my first language I am sorry for my bad English

 Me (20) live in India with my parents. The story I wanted to share is about me. When I was around the age of 9 or 10, I got sexually assaulted by a pedophile who is my step-uncle (as my grandmother died when my mom was born and he married another woman who is his mom). He was studying at college at the time for computer science engineering, and he was in his second year. 
 
My parents were always busy and they affen leave me at his place,everything started has a game, I was playing with my brother and he wanted to join,at first he was just touching chest and went down to my pants and also tricked me to touch he's penies after that I wasn't comfortable and after all that he asked me if I want to sleep with him and my stupid ass answered yes ,I was sleeping next to him as my back faceing him i couldn't sleep because I was scared and i think he thought I was sleeping and started to rub my ass with is penies after rubbing he pulled my pants down and insteaded in my ass also while touching my penies at the same time I couldn't do anything because I was scared and didn't know what he doing with my body he noticed I was awake and started to do it more aggressively and also he kissed me several times after he satisfied he just pushed me out of hi bed i slept on the floor this continued for a year i didn't told this to my parents at that time (because I was scared and i did not know what is happening)
 
Then, on my 10th birthday, he showed me porn and explained to me what it is and what they are doing in the video. After hearing that, I felt like discussing myself and what happened every day. I went home and told my parents I never wanted to go back there. I never told them the reason why, and sometimes they forced me to go, but I refused, and my relationship with them got worse, and sometimes they forced me to go, but I refused, and my relationship with my parents got bad. I wasn't getting good grades at school, and they changed my school hoping that I would improve on myself and my studies, but it got worse. I couldn't even make a friend or improve my grades. I couldn't focus on my studies or my life. It was hard at the time. 
 
I never told anyone about this, but when my sister said that she had been dating him for about a year, I told him what happened to me, and she broke up with him. She encouraged me to tell my parents about what happened, and I told my parents that he sexually assaulted me when they left me at his place. When I told my parents about this, I didn't want them to go and fight him or file a complaint against him. All I wanted to hear was something comforting (""it's ok, I am here for you, or it must have been hard for you""), but nothing happened. There were no comments or anything, and they did nothing. 
 
He is now living his life happily and without any consequences. 
I am getting better and better and trying my best to live a happy life. I did think about ending my life, but when I think about it, if he can live a happy life, why can't I?

Problems with sex life and mental health please help. ,6,0.8,"Im a 21 year old male. I have a wonderful girlfriend that I love very much. She is a wonderful person. Always makes sure that I am well and that I feel loved. She is also very good looking and fit. However, recently I just feel like I don’t really want to have sex with her. It all started one day when my penis went flaccide during sexual intercourse. I have the tendancy to overthink things especially when it has to do with my health, so I immediately started thinking that I have erectile dysfunction. (Also it is important to note that I have a disease called varicocele on my testicle for which the doctor said I don’t need treatment). Yet I still linked my penis going flaccid to this condition. I started overthinking and wondering if I have low testosterone. Turns out my testosterone is fine after I did a test. Despite that I still think about how my penis went flaccid and its almost like I am anxious to have sex with her now because I am constantly thinking about my penis going flaccid and therefore I can’t fully enjoy the sexual intercourse so I would rather just avoid it altogether. This has led to her feeling upset and unwanted. She also has some insecurities and this is additionally fuelling them as she feels like I don’t want to have sex with her and she is the issue. I don’t want to lose her over this and I don’t want to upset her any longer. 

Please help me. I realise that the problem is probably in my own head and it’s not due to the varicocele however how can I stop overthinking it.

Also I want to add that I have been suffering from anxiety for most of my life if thats of any relevance. 

Im sorry if this doesn’t make complete sense. I struggle to understand my own brain sometimes too.

The most harmful thing bad parenting can do. ,21,1.0,"The most harmful thing bad parenting can do to you is take away your ability to love yourself.

I sob sometimes thinking of the immense potential I had, and how potential only really counts when you’re young.

I grew up in a strict household with siblings who excelled in sports and school. I always hid my mental health issues but often would push people away. I was always treated differently by people who were not my friends and anyone I was able to develop reasonably deep relationships, I would turn on them and tell them how horrible of a person I am and try to make decisions for them saying it’s not fair to them that I xyz whatever it is. I’ve always caused self isolation believing I deserved it. Recently my significant other of two years told me he has feelings for another person and for me and wants to make it work with me and figure out why these emotions for the other person have stemmed because he’s been nothing but happy and fulfilled with me.

I keep pushing him away, lashing out. I haven’t done this with him before but have in many other friendships and family relationships. I think it’s my default setting thinking I don’t deserve love. I think it’s finally over with him because I got drunk alone on a Saturday night trying to stop the sadness and told him to pursue the other girl. I am self destructive and I just want him to be happy. I don’t think anyone should ever have to put up with my behavior and that’s why I push them away. I guess I’m not looking for anything in particular. This is just my confession.

I will always feel selfish and guilty and unworthy of love. I am sick of hurting other people and want them to be happy. I don’t know what to do anymore and I cannot imagine a life without him. I know I’m young but I also know how deeply I cared about him. I know my heart is broken and it’s fully my fault. I’m both numb yet feel every form of sadness right now but I also hate myself because I’m just another girl crying over another breakup and how cliche is that? I don’t deserve him nor do I deserve the happiness because I am just crying over a cliche troupe when there are real people out there experiencing real hardships and it is ridiculous that I can’t get my shit together. I am pathetic. I think it’s valid for other people to feel and experience any, every, and all feelings through any situation they are going through but I, alone, have not earned that right.

Feeling lost tonight...,1,1.0,"It doesn't help that I am hungover (yeah yeah I know I know!) from being cross-faded last night.

I was so embarrassed I left after I had finished my beer and my soda (I didn't intend on getting plastered, I swear it!). I went back there tonight (diff bartender, thankfully) and only had ONE beer.

I'm tired and going to sleep. I haven't even really masturbated at all for the entire day, either. I'm so depressed and I have no fucking clue why.

Has anyone just felt off like they don't know what they want to do or where they want to go...I'm so bored and restless. Thankfully I didn't let alcohol ruin a perfectly normal boring day for me.

I dunno if this is a vent or need suppprt...I guess both? I have to go downtown tomorrow and the kids are officially on Summer Break now! Their last day of school was Friday, but none of the kids went Thurs or Fri bc we were all vacationing in the Poconos at an Airbnb.

Did I have a panic attack ,1,1.0,"I am young guy who recently had a odd experience. I don’t think I’ve ever had a panic attack(up for debate now) but I had a recent even that has put into question if I have or haven’t. 
I was watching a movie with a group of people including my girlfriend and her friend and that friend was sitting in between me and my gf. I suddenly had what I like to call an autism attack where I get overstimulated and need to leave an environment but this one was cause by feeling isolated from my gf and the loudness of the movie. 

I went and sat on a toilet for a while but not long enough as I realised that my friends were worried about me so I returned to my seat but still felt shit and the isolated feeling didn’t change. I decided to try to remove the sound through other means as leaving again would cause people to worry more so I put my headphones in and tried to stop thinking.

At this point I suddenly realised I might be having a panic attack but I don’t know what that actually means and I think a part of me wanted to have an attack due to attention so i sat there having a crisis on if I was having an attack. This then had me think about past events with similar things that happened where I could have had a panic attack.

The medicine journey is a literal roller coaster. ,1,1.0,"I have been taking medication for my mental illness for roughly three years. I started off with a diagnosis of Depression.. then was later diagnosed with Bipolar. Started Buspar and Depakote. Buspar was shitty for me, Depakote was great until it wasn’t. Bounced to some sleeping medicine, lamictal, vistaril, Vraylar.. and the list continues. After starting Buspar and Depakote months later I’m referred to a psychologist who diagnosis me with.. bipolar, BPD, anxiety, ADHD, some traits of schizophrenia but doesn’t believe I have it. And etc. The doctor also looked at me and told me that if I was still self harming people would think I was crazy and that I would go away to the hospital. Months and months later.. I get wasted and got into huge fight with my mom who tries to take me to the hospital and I run away and didn’t come back until she swore she wouldn’t take me. Great times! Then I get referred to a psychiatrist. He starts me back on vistaril and lamictal. And also prescribed adderall and Luvox. I feel the medicine I’m on now help. But it’s just the simple fact of struggling to take them everyday. Does anyone else have this problems and what do they do to ensure they take there medicine. I’ve tried a pill planner, alarms and people calling me to wake me up to take my meds. It fails. Which it is most definitely my option to listen to all these but sometimes I just wish I didn’t need the meds anymore.. but I know how that will go. Even on the meds somedays I want to SH, or down a whole bottle. I’ve also considered abusing my meds.. but there’s a piece of me that knows better. But I get tired of hearing “it’s one day at a time”, or “you have to look at life at a different perspective”. Life is shitty and sucks.

Am I insane?,1,1.0,"All I do is fight my own mind... my past,.. I used to enjoy hurting others that deserved it, and every day I spend away, I'm drawn to my old self... I don't believe in God, but I feel my own demons... my true self before I met her...

Every second, I'm away from my cure... I feel temptation to do bad things to those who deserve... I feel like dexter but more inhumane... the things I'm told to do... the things I want to do... 

Yet she understood... I would crucify myself if I didn't have my children for what I would become... I feel no pain... no emotion yet that is what devouring that it what haunts me ever second of every day... 

I want to hurt people who deserve it... I could be dexter... I could make TV come to life so easy as that is what I used to do... and did for over 10 years... yet she stops me. The thought of being with my family again haunts my own thoughts

I am the true evil beyond evil... yet I ignore what I truly want because of what I love... I wasn't made... to love... I wasn't made to be a father... I was made to give in to everything that was evil... to extinguish evil....

I know what I was made for... yet I made a  new life with love, care, compassion, and more protection, I purpose beyond what I believed from a young age... 

I was made to believe only negativity would become positive... yet I learned through my own voices inside my head day in day out second after second... 
That pain doesn't exist... It's just a distraction... I was made to feel nothing... I was made for others to feel distractions... 

Yet all I feel is pain mentally and emotionally... I can't feel physical pain... that is why I do what I can for those I most care... when I feel emotion... the only emotion I feel now... It's what my own children need...

I'm no longer capable of love... it was ripped away the moment I knew it was too late... I will always love the women I will always desire, but it will never be enough... 

Anyone can tell me I'm ill... I know I am... mentally... physically and emotionally... all I've known is pain throughout my entire life... and for the first time, I realised... only emotional pain consumes me... mental pain is no longer a thing.

Mental and physical pain is an illusion... the only true pain is emotion... yet I've been told all my life I'm the single person who does not have emotional pain... I'm emotionless... so maybe I'm truly nothing...

does anyone else miss lockdown? am i crazy?,6,0.88,"Am I the only one who felt happier during lockdown? I usually hear the opposite.

* Peace and quiet without loud parties.
* Popular people finally felt what it’s like to be alone, forced to eat their own words of advice they've given me for decades ""you need to learn to be happy alone""- turns out they can't follow their own advice...
* Inconsiderate behavior was punished.
* Masks gave me equal treatment - without a mask I'm treated badly everywhere by strangers (apparently i must be ugly), when no one could see my face suddenly I was treated the same as everyone else- it made me realise how easy life is for everyone else.
* Safer streets reduced my anxiety.
* Time off work improved my mental health.
* No plane or traffic noise cured my headaches.
* Less crime and anti-social behavior made it safe to go outside.
* Grocery deliveries were done properly reducing my stress massively.
* No work stress or construction noise.

My happiness improved a thousand-fold.

My mental health improved massively. My headaches stopped completely, anxiety went away, everything became better.

When it takes a worldwide virus / lockdown to improve your life you know you must be really squashed by society... and yes I've tried moving area, it's just variations of the same problems.

Anyone else experience similar?

My younger brother has given up on our parents. Any help/advice would be appreciated I'm freaking out.,1,1.0,"Hi everyone. I don't usually post on reddit but I don't really know what else to do here. Ever since middle school my younger brother has always been jaded. Everyone thought that it was simply the teenage years; God know's I went through mine. But now, I'm 21 and he's 19. And nothing in the last 5 years has changed. In fact, it's gotten to the point where he feels nothing at all towards our parents. I've spoken to him and he says that all the things they've done for him don't matter, and that he wanted respect. To not be screamed at if he never screams at them.   
  
That type of stuff. Now don't get me wrong, I've had my moments with my parents, and sure, they very rarely apologize for anything, but they do things out of love. Everything they do is for us and for some reason he disregards all that as shit that doesn't matter. They have their flaws, but all parents do. And for some reason he has this rationale that they've used up all their chances with him. Even though he never once verbalized that. It was all in his head. He'd come home thinking ""okay I'll give them another chance"", gets yelled at for something, and then boom; chance broken. It's like he has this whole ""eye for an eye"" thing going on where shit has built up over the last 5 years and now they're reaping what they sew. A  
  
s for college, my parents are afraid to send him back. He's been struggling with anxiety and depression a lot lately and they don't feel comfortable with sending him back to school if he is completely closed off from them and their help. But the way he sees it is them ""blackmailing"" him into speaking to them about things (even though its all 1 word sentences). He's even willing to let them pull him out and go to community college instead just to prove a point. He's a very bright kid, with honestly more potential than myself. I'm so scared for him, so scared for my parents, and I just feel like there's a massive hole being torn in my family.   
  
I've been trying to mediate the best I can, since he considers me (and all extended relatives) family. But I feel so out of my league here. I don't know what to do. Seeing my parents suffer this way has very much taken a toll on me. I've told him this but he sticks to his rationale. My parents want to take him to a psychiatrist since he doesn't talk in therapy. He's also on antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds but I doubt they're the reason behind this. I dont know, he just is dead inside reguarding them.   
  
Other family there's a little light and he's normal with friends. I just hate seeing his dead eye stare. I'm shaken to my core and all I want is for him to try to fix things. My parents would do anything to get him back but for some reason he doesn't see them that way or in that light. Like no matter what they do it isn't genuine.

Feeling lost currently. (Vent),2,1.0,"Hi, M18 here.

I barely have any friends, I do have a friend group irl but we only hang out during game nights. But in fact I’m only there for one friend, mainly because he’s chill and the rest are controversial but I’m only staying for that friend.

And at school I’m friendly towards 5 other classmates in total, but I only care for my best friend there really, I feel bad though but that friend is my no. 1.

Since Halloween last year I realized I was madly in love with my best friend (they’re born female but identifies as genderfluid) I wish I could relive that moment when I realized, but alas.

They know, they know I love them. But they don’t feel the same but I respect that, but at the same time I want more and it hurts, I get jealous and attached much but it’s a struggle I have to work on.

Everything hurts and sometimes I want to disappear I feel like my parents are treating me as incapable (even though not by purpose) mainly because of my autism & adhd diagnosis. I barely do the things I need to do to reach my personal goals which sucks but I don’t have the motivation.

I feel lost entirely with my emotions, but I always think about things too much. Too many “what if?” And “If only”.

I only wish I had the money to go on a trip outside of my country so I can focus on that and not be in my bubble in my house here where I live. But that’s a wish of course, not realistic.

Very dangerous place with alcohol - shot in the morning for anxiety ,1,1.0,"I’m mid-30’s and I’ve always consumed alcohol moderately. My 20’s were wild but for around 10 years it’s just a glass of wine or two on weekends online, or some beers. I don’t drink during the week.
I struggle with anxiety and stress mainly due to my work (high pressure environment as an account manager) and up until recently on days where I know something big is happening at work, I just brave through it but get stomach aches and headaches, along with losing the ability to function properly so my performance suffers.

Last Monday morning before leaving for work I did something I’ve never done before, took a moment in leave sitting In the garden and had a shot of whisky. It made the world to difference. Of course not drunk, but my confidence spiked, nerves went away, and I smashed the day. 
I did it again on the Friday and again it cured it all.
This morning (Monday) I had a shot of gin to calm myself down before the day and once again it save me.

I keep seeing how alcohol is bad for self medication and I’m not an idiot, of course I know it is and I know this can’t go on, but now I’ve discovered this trick I’m scared.

Help with relationship!,1,1.0,"I am struggling a bit with my relationship with my partner right now.

That means even if they pass the summer semester, it's not a guarantee that they could start the next semester right away which they only offer in fall and if they don't, their post work graduate permit would most likely not be valid.

There’s been multiple instances of me getting up and actually screaming at them out of frustration cause I’m not yelling or screaming. They also just sigh and ignore me, or it feels like they gang up on me in an argument when I disagree. They always just end it by acting passive aggressive and saying “ok” in that tone.

Thought I have BPD but don’t know how to bring it up  ,2,1.0,"Hello, guys; I’m here to explain how I feel, not to give me a diagnosis. I have had a few on-and-off relationships these past six years. I knew something was not typical about my emotions, and even two boyfriends told me my mood swings are crazy. Sadly I had to suffer abuse from them due to their frustration with me. So my childhood was okay just a father that was not there at all emotional and would yell right when he got mad. So he couldn’t control his emotions. I notice when I’m mad at my partners. I get mad and then break up with them. A week later, I’ll come back. I just have trouble figuring myself out, and I’m in my early 20s. I’m happy but one thing can mess up by day. I always have to tell my friends what they think of me and at times I care too much what people think or say about me. Every month I convince myself I have a new disease to the point I go to a doctor. I read about BPD and could relate a lot, except the impulsive drug use and suicide. My therapist thinks I have depression, but I think I’m going to tell her to look into BPD. 
It’s a cycle when they leave my boyfriend I get sad because they didn’t change and then when I find someone I’m happy and goes downhill fast.

Should I still talk to her or just let things rest? ,1,1.0,"I (24M) broke up with my girlfriend (22F) of 7 months a few weeks ago because being in a relationship made me realise a lot of mental health issues. Unrealistic expectations of love, constant self-doubt about my love for her and hating myself for having such thoughts, feeling insecure about how I was acting with her, jealousy of how she was such a happy-go-lucky type while I was always depressed, feeling gross about sex stuff, constantly have doubts, feeling like I had nothing to do outside of talking to her and meeting her, and when I wasn't with her, I'd be stuck in my head about whether I loved her or not and all that. It was a lot of personal issues. I had moments where I would be joking around with her and hugging and cuddling, but the moment she left the house, I would be depressed because the doubts would come back. Numbing myself by distractions and keeping busy just made me more distant and numb. And I got anxious about all of these things and just told her I can't be in this relationship anymore.

We started dating and had already established that we both wanted something serious. Neither of us had been in a serious relationship before. Now, I've started therapy because of how badly I got into my head about all of these doubts. Like why did I doubt my love for her in the first place, I hate myself and all that. But I understand that I can't constantly be in a state of love but also I can't keep the relationship going like that? I don't understand love. Somehow through all my doubts, I had convinced myself I don't love her. And ended up breaking up because I hated fighting my doubts and thoughts. And I didn't know how to just live with them in the relationship cause I doubted the whole relationship?? Idk if that makes sense.



I miss her. She wants to remain friends because she knows it wasn't personal, it was mental health that got in the way. And I would like to be friends, its just that when I see her and talk to her, I miss how it used to be before the issues started. And I go back to blaming myself for it and the doubts come back and I can never ignore them... I miss her but I'm better off working on myself right now. It's only been a few weeks since we broke up. Therapy has been working slowly. But when will I be able to face her without spiralling into my head again? When will I be able to date someone (her or someone else) without having all this happen again?


I do feel for her. I feel bad for what I've done and what I've put her through with my crap. But after all that has happened, I don't think I can go back to normal with her. But she wishes to stay friends. Should I keep in touch or no? Is it better to keep in touch or let it be?

When I get upset I start screaming really loud. But only in my head. Am I going legitimately insane?,3,1.0,"I am wondering if I going insane.

No matter how many times I tell him I just want to live in a clean place and he should stop leaving his clothes on the floor, etc etc.
Lately, when I encounter myself in situations where I am just reliving again the same issue I start screaming in my head, but now, it got so severe that it almost doesn’t matter anymore what the problem is, if I am in a situation that makes me upset I will usually just go speechless, stare at the person or thing and scream in my head. No words come out and I have no energy to have an interaction, I just scream really loud in my head.
I am wondering if at some point it will go from a silent scream to a real one and become crazy. 

Why am I worried?
I have history of deep depression in the family. My grandmother was know to one day run outside the house naked and later to not ever speak with anyone. She lived until she was 80, and didn’t speak to anyone for 40 years. She stopped doing things for herself and would just stare at people, in the end she ended up having to be taken care of by others.

I’m having so much anxiety tonight,1,1.0,"Because I can’t use several flares I thought a content warning was the most appropriate one. But this is a vent, and I don’t discuss substances mainly.

Where do I even start? I have anxiety about spending too much money on video games. Then I get anxiety because I don’t play said video games (I don’t currently feel up for it, and it makes me feel like I’ve thrown money in the lake). I’ve been sick twice within a month (causing me to puke and have 0 appetite) and I’m scared I’ll get sick again. I’m still not fully good because in the mornings there’s still a risk of puking. And I quite literally can’t afford to be sick and stay home another week.

My YouTube recommended is acting super weird, recommending me things I’ve never watched (and on occasion I also scroll past a suggestive thumbnail). I’m scared that I’ve accidentally gotten a virus or been hacked somehow.

I have a driver’s lesson on Tuesday. I gotta go to the big city on Wednesday and talk to a psychologist about what possible issues I might have in a job due to my mental issues. I also gotta pull weeds in the garden.

CW: Cannabis

The usual place where I buy cannabis is acting strange. Almost all of their stock is empty and the delivery I ordered is being late. I have no idea where else to go and that stresses me out so much. Plus I spent $70 on a package that takes suspiciously long to arrive, and as I already have anxiety about money, that doesn’t make me feel any better.

This anxiety causes my stomach to feel weird. And due to my recent sickness, my stomach is so much more sensitive than normal, so basically I feel like I might throw up again.

What are the biggest challenges you face with managing your mental health

How do you currently address the problem

What do you dislike about the current solutions you use

What would an ideal solution look like for you

I’d greatly appreciate any thoughts on these questions or suggestions for other important questions I should look into.

Why do I feel tense around my mom?,2,1.0,"I think me and my mom are pretty close, I’m a student but living with her for the summer and I want to stop feeling so tense and overwhelmed by her.

I felt a lot of the time like I had to emotionally support her bc she wasn’t strong enough to leave and I couldn’t go on my own. Then when my dad died it’s like everything was about her.

Sleep and Ed relapse?,1,1.0,"HIGHLY TRIGGERING CONTENT READ AT OWN RISK!!

I have not formally been diagnosed but I know I have an ED. It's been on and of recovery for the last 3 years and I relapsed last week.

It's been really hard because I'm living a lie again but it feels so good. However I feel like nothing is ever good enough again. For the sake of others I won't mention numbers and I hope this makes sense.

If I work out for x amount of time, what's stopping me doing more? And then it went onto calories, if I didn't eat today I would be x amount of calories more in deficit. 

I've eaten alot more than I would have liked in the last couple of days and I'm kind of shifting into the idea of sleeping less so I can work out more.

Help for my brother,1,1.0,"Hello, I wanted to know if there’s some way you can guide me on how to navigate around my brother’s mental illness. He is currently 29 years old and was diagnosed about 5 years ago with paranoid schizophrenia. Since then he has been navigating this world on his own with little to no guidance. I myself am married and he lives with our mom and dad at home. My parents are in denial about his condition and have neglected to seek help themselves all these years. My brother had always been a kind person and it’s very hard to see him acting in the way he is. Following his diagnosis 5 years ago, he has improved in many ways. However, the lasting impact of those medications he had taken all those years ago has left a toll on his mental health. He has become very quiet and at times when he does speak up, it comes across as either insensitive or random in nature. I have never brought up his mental health issues to him before and I don’t know how to approach this by myself. What I know is that he needs proper guidance or therapy to bring out his real true self that we all knew and loved when he was a young adult.

How can I break up with her?,1,1.0,"Hey guys, I'd be happy to get some advice on my situation. My gf 25F and I 26M have been in a relationship for 6 years. I met her through a mutual friend of ours and I fell in love with her pretty quickly, about a month after we met for the first time. We like the same type of music, went to many concerts together, and also enjoy the same type of games. She was dumped a couple of weeks before I met her and was pretty needy all the time but I liked that about her. I moved in with her after a year to study in the same city as her. When we lived together, she got really aggressive sometimes, breaking glasses or plates, other times she claimed she was depressive and refused to go out of the house for days. Fast forward, I moved back to my hometown after my Bachelor's, while she continued doing her Master's in the same city. I didn't really think she loved me anymore and I wanted to move on but we were still in a relationship even though we practically didn't see each other anymore. She claimed that she needed me and even called me when she was suicidal so I couldn't really break up with her. Some time passed and she wanted us to move in together, so that's what we did one year ago. When we were together again, she was constantly acting jealous and took my phone one night. She found some old chats with girls I used to text with while we were in a long distance relationship, and got really mad at me, she got physical even. She wanted to break up with me but I still loved her, so I was begging her to stay. Eventually, she said she would try to forgive me but that she wasn't sure if she could trust me anymore. Yet, after a few days apart, I could convince her to come back. Everything seemed fine, until she started a new job. She seemed stressed and told me she had panic attacks at work and she wanted to kill herself. I brought her to the mental health hospital hoping she would get better. She already left after a week and broke up with me, claiming that she was in love with some random drug addict she met in therapy. I couldn't believe her and tried to dump her but I couldn't because she's suicidal and I still love her. She said she didn't want to hurt me anymore and I should let her go.

Moving on in life and change,1,1.0,"Hey everyone, I wanted to get some advice from people who know a thing or two about accepting change, and moving on to a different job. 
I work with animals, and I recently walked away from my job at a kennel, the environment was very toxic, I have had 6 different managers in 2 and a half years. I love working with animals, it was all worth it, I could block out the crappy parts of my job. I recently  decided to move on to a new place, also working with animals. I had to take a pay cut and it's further away, but the peace of mind of working at an animal sanctuary seems worth it. 
Tomorrow is my first day, I am nervous. I'm excited to get started, and I'm still quite sad that I no longer work at the last company. I feel like I will have to move out of this city to be closer to work. I have never liked this city, but I am helping out my senior parents and living with them currently. Unless I can get them on board with moving, I would screw them over moving away now. So there is the worry of the longer drive to work, the vehicle that's quite old, the longer work days and less time off. I was only working part time at my last job. 4 days a week, 3 days off. It was very nice, I became very accustomed to this schedule. Hour lunch, I could just drive home and make lunch. I was extremely blessed. Now I am having to venture further, it's just making me very nervous. Next 3 months will be a big trial for me.

I know I am a good person, I love working with animals. I consider myself really good at working with dogs in particular, but at this new job, I will be working with farm animals. BIG CHANGE. I am looking forward. The last job, upper management made me feel incompetent, and really bad about myself. I am glad not to have to deal with them and their video calls again. I just feel like I will never get ahead in my life financially. I place a lot of importance on my finances, and I have been struggling for a long time. Working with animals was the trade off, it's worth it for my mental health, but I just feel like I will have to go back to welding, or maybe get in to another trade like an electrician.

I’m currently on Vraylar which also isn’t the best but it makes my mood better at the cost of me being tired all the time and getting no sleep and having this nagging feeling that I always need to be doing something. I just started Concerta 18mg 11 days ago. 

But anyways I was just chilling watching a movie then I remembered that I can’t Recall anything. Due to my ADHD my memory is so bad it’s almost like dementia. This makes me depressed and I began to think “what’s the point” which lead to the suicidal ideation coming back. I’ll see things in my room and have intrusive thoughts about hurting myself with them. Today I woke up and they’re turning into urges. Like it feels like I could do it. But I don’t have a reason why. It’s just intrusive thoughts.

I just moved so I don’t have access to a psychiatrist. Nor do I have any money to make an appointment.

Am I Selfish?,1,1.0,"I’m F 24 residing in the Philippines and currently working a 10hour job earning a decent amount of money.

Probably 6 years ago, I noticed this somewhat mole on my back that I thought was just a warts and have it removed on a facility that offers facial treatment and stuff. It was very itchy then came back rapidly and I ignored it thinking it would just go away someday just like my other warts. 

As years go by, whenever I get to look at it, I noticed it change its size and shape and color. That’s when I decided to see whatever it might be and saw the how to spot a melanoma and all of the characteristics, it is something it has. I know this gut feeling on me whenever I feel like I would die young that this is it. This will be the reason.

I know people will advise me to have it checked especially that it’s been yrs that it’s here and I could have it checked, I have a choice. However, I don’t want to. Cause I know when I get diagnosed, I will start overthinking a lot and would have to get treated and I already experience being hospitalized and I hate feeling like I was a burden to people. The biggest factor is because I don’t want the money I saved to just go to my medicals bills cause growing up poor and loving to travel and see the world at the same time, I’d rather use it to go to places if I only have limited time left here on earth.

Besides, I really don’t think I would live that much. I have a planned upcoming travel which I already want to use my savings for and would like to take my sister with me just to make some memories together. As much as I know that a long life to live means longer opportunity to do my dreams but if you live in the Philippines where life of most of the people here suck due to low income, I’m afraid if I choose life, I’ll get stuck in the phase of depression because “why me” and loads of medical bills not knowing how to pay them because what I’m earning is just enough for me and my family. And never really be able to do what I really wanted. 

I want to travel now but it hurts me thinking that I’m too selfish if I do it instead of getting checked especially to those who are dear to me. I really hope this is just a random mole and I know I am to be blamed for not getting it checked instead of overthinking and considering positive possibility but thinking that I might really have a time limited to live motivates me more to live my life to the fullest.

A needed vent,1,1.0,"‼️TW SH, ED, SU!C!DAL THOUGHT ‼️PLEASE DONT READ IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH THESE

for context, i am 17 and suffered with my mental health since i was 12 years old. i’ve been anxious and depressed this whole time, where it started very mild and in past years has gotten very severe due to events such as family bereavements, grief and more which of course fuelled health anxiety and depression.

since 2022, my anxiety got so much worse, where i’m experiencing physical symptoms such as tingling in hands, chest pain, difficulty breathing and more for long extended periods of time, kind of like a very long panic attack, this has in recent months got slightly better but i still suffer very badly with anxiety and those thoughts, which make me not want to go to college or out generally out of fear.

i’ve also had an eating disorder, not diagnosed, but i am now aware there was a problem that i didn’t recognise at the time, where i would eat one meal a day to lose weight, but didn’t recognise that i was in fact losing weight and a large amount. due to my mental health decline i have had intrusive (?) thoughts of almost wanting to relapse into this to help with my body issues, and i hate the thoughts so much they add so much to the depression and i don’t know how to stop it

the worst one of them right now is my depression. i’ve been depressed for 5 years, but it’s been mainly high functioning, where it has lead to sh and attempts but only linking with my other issues, and i could easily keep it on the down low. since february i’ve felt worse than ever, it has got so bad to the point where it takes over my other problems and is the only prominent one unless i am really really having a terrible time with anxiety.

i am so so low, depressed, empty and kind of bored with everything, and hopeless. i don’t know how to get out of it, i feel so lonely as i feel i’ve mentioned this too much in past years to friends and they’re done with it and i don’t want to annoy them or bring the mood down. i just feel so bad i can’t even phrase how much i am suffering, i just want to talk to someone but i don’t feel as though i have anyone and i’m alone.

sorry for the vent but i am so scared of reaching my breaking point and not having anybody at all aware of it, advice would be very much appreciated.",mentalhealth,yves1604,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dhfip4/a_needed_vent/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13185979184521e-06,"['sh', 'ed', 'su', 'c', 'dal', 'thought', 'dont', 'read', 'struggle', 'context', 'suffered', 'mental', 'health', 'since', 'year', 'old', 'anxious', 'depressed', 'whole', 'time', 'started', 'mild', 'past', 'year', 'gotten', 'severe', 'due', 'event', 'family', 'bereavement', 'grief', 'course', 'fuelled', 'health', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'since', 'anxiety', 'got', 'much', 'worse', 'experiencing', 'physical', 'symptom', 'tingling', 'hand', 'chest', 'pain', 'difficulty', 'breathing', 'long', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'kind', 'like', 'long', 'panic', 'attack', 'recent', 'month', 'got', 'slightly', 'better', 'still', 'suffer', 'badly', 'anxiety', 'thought', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'college', 'generally', 'fear', 'also', 'eating', 'disorder', 'diagnosed', 'aware', 'problem', 'recognise', 'time', 'would', 'eat', 'one', 'meal', 'day', 'lose', 'weight', 'recognise', 'fact', 'losing', 'weight', 'large', 'amount', 'due', 'mental', 'health', 'decline', 'intrusive', 'thought', 'almost', 'wanting', 'relapse', 'help', 'body', 'issue', 'hate', 'thought', 'much', 'add', 'much', 'depression', 'know', 'stop', 'worst', 'one', 'right', 'depression', 'depressed', 'year', 'mainly', 'high', 'functioning', 'lead', 'sh', 'attempt', 'linking', 'issue', 'could', 'easily', 'keep', 'low', 'since', 'february', 'felt', 'worse', 'ever', 'got', 'bad', 'point', 'take', 'problem', 'prominent', 'one', 'unless', 'really', 'really', 'terrible', 'time', 'anxiety', 'low', 'depressed', 'empty', 'kind', 'bored', 'everything', 'hopeless', 'know', 'get', 'feel', 'lonely', 'feel', 'mentioned', 'much', 'past', 'year', 'friend', 'done', 'want', 'annoy', 'bring', 'mood', 'feel', 'bad', 'even', 'phrase', 'much', 'suffering', 'want', 'talk', 'someone', 'feel', 'though', 'anyone', 'alone', 'sorry', 'vent', 'scared', 'reaching', 'breaking', 'point', 'anybody', 'aware', 'advice', 'would', 'much', 'appreciated']","{'neg': 0.294, 'neu': 0.661, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.9991}",negative

Why do I want to hurt people? - Dark,3,0.81,"Was told by some in r/jung to post this here, I hope you can give me some help

Sorry if this is not the right way to post this question, but I’ve had it ever since I can remember. It’s of interest to me to understand why I have these feelings and thought this sub may find it interesting also to dissect. 

Background, I’m a pretty successful early twenties male, had a great family, great early life, friends, relationships, I’m in very good shape, very disciplined, generally very happy. No history of any abuse. Some slight mental health in teens but mainly around slight social anxiety, some slight anger but nothing out of the ordinary. Generally empathetic to people and animals. Very loyal, loving etc etc. I do not think I’m a psychopath or sociopath really at all. 

Yet, I fantasise about hurting and killing… As fucking crazy as that sounds. My earliest memory is being on a beach as a child with my mother, and watching other little kids and imagining drowning them, yes,,, that crazy. This has gone literally as long as I remember. The feelings are almost masturbatory and I generally find the idea of hurting someone extremely appealing. 

It feels like a separate personality to me, these urges, constantly calling on me to act on them or think about them. I will tell more below due to character limits.

IF you find this interesting, have any info or questions please reply, thank you.

I'm going through alot within me which keeps my mood irritated all the time.Because of which my parents and I get into a dirty argument.I know I am doing wrong but at the same time I cannot help it.
Seeing my peers doing better than me at life makes me feel like a loser.I feel happy for them but feel angry about my own self.I wished,prayed,worked as hard as I can, followed spirituality etc. but nothing changed from the last 1 year.
Now the only option left with me is to accept my fate and try to live with it.Also I feel I need to be mentally prepared for worse thing to happen because I know how bad it's gonna affect my mental health which is already in a bad state since two years.The burnouts and the stress caused to my parents are the things which I am worried about.
Basically a chain reaction which would keep things making worse and away from what I want.Top of that being jobless would make things more worse from making me reluctant to accept a less paying job to family being unsatisfied by me God knows what all others things gonna happen.
Giving up on an ideal dream life of mine is the only option left and need to accept and go through a life which I hate or I don't want.I feel depressed thinking of the upcoming years and thr consequences.

Dealing with trauma ,1,1.0,"Im not sure if there is content warning for this but some content is just genuinely gross, like disturbing. 
So I used to live in a household that was very... bad. I wont go into detail but the main part that's still haunting me is how disgusting it was. Im going to be as raw and real as possible so I can get the best advice so this may be completely gross and disgusting for some people just a warning. So when i say my house was gross, i mean GROSS. My mom was basically a hoarder but also is bi polar (as well am I, and BPD has been said by my psychiatrist as well so im not sure if its both or there is a misdiagnosis somewhere in there) so she was depressed or out overspending , which was her main state when manic). My dad worked and I had school, so my mom would wake up in order to get me from school and then she would sleep. I was a CHILD at the time and I had school and... being a child to focus on, so obviously no one was there to clean, and we had so many pets that my mom wasn't awake to let outside. You can guess what happened. The house was full of just random stuff and dog shit (literal shit). Everything was not taken care of so there was mold and stains and it was disgusting, but i still felt guilty. On weekends I would stay up Friday night until Saturday evening cleaning up piles of paper that the dogs used as a bathroom, random food no one picked up, dishes that had been there for months, just anything gross you can think of. As you can imagine, that motherfucking house stuck with me. About five years later and I struggle with it every day. Like i said i did most of the cleaning so i dealt with the stupid rings around the toilet, the stuff growing on the dishes in the sink, buildup of mold or whatever on the faucets, awful uncleaned showers, and just dirty stuff in places that are meant to make you feel CLEAN. So now here i am in a different house that is way better and is clean, but i cannot go a day without dealing with an episode where i think about some  situation (that i actually didn't deal with at the house, ex. licking the mold of the faucet or the ring or mold in the toilet, just that kind of stuff). When i think of things like this, and in certain really bad times can be every second im not busy with something else, i immediately tense up and am fully in that scenario I've made up and cant move, im on the verge of tears or an anxiety attack, but most of the time i feel like i have to ""punch it out"" which is my nickname for dealing with this situation currently until i find a healthy coping mechanism or whatever. I also can't walk barefoot in my own house or do the dishes anymore without feeling like im going to have a panic attack, which is bad for when i have to move out and no one else is there to do the dishes and stuff. I just need help if anyone can. Is this like ptsd even if its not something i actually had to do? 

Also im adding everything i can for details so here's a journal entry titled ""PUNCH IT OUT"" 
I was in the shower then boom. Can't move, can't breathe, imagining a scene where i put my feet near the drain or my face near it. Had to lick it or deal with it at all. I need to punch this feeling out, or kick it or bang my head against the wall or flex my muscles until they explode.

Cognitive dissonance and self hate,1,1.0,"I hate myself. I hate myself so much and every day it feels like I hate myself more and more. 

I did like 100 hours of therapy in fall of last year, and it helped. A lot. I re-enrolled recently to complete my journey. But I'm now back to hating myself. 

  
I've always felt that I'm just not a nice enough person. During therapy, I learned that having compassion for myself would help me have compassion for others and be nicer to others. And it did! My therapist and I delved into all the reasons I do what I do and the reasons I flip out at people so easily. When I understood why, it allowed me to be more patient with myself. And finally I was able to extend that to others. It has gotten to a point that I now can read articles about people who have literally committed the worst crimes (yeah those ones) and thought they were still humans who deserve love and compassion. I never would've felt that way before therapy. I just told someone yesterday that no matter what he does, he still deserves compassion and love. Even if he harms someone else, he still deserves that.

  
But today, I feel like shit. I hate myself and I feel like I am a horrible person. I wish I could die. I feel terrible about a mistake I've recently made that could've impacted someone else, but I also just feel like a failure. Like I've made no real progress after all.

I don't feel real anymore.,1,1.0,"Hello, I'm a 26 year old man. In the past year, my mother lost a kidney, I almost died of sepsis twice due to Crohn's disease that I didn't know I had, I had major abdominal surgery and spent over two months total in various hospitals including spending four total weeks out of the hospital with self-maintained JP drains in my abdomen, then got laid off from a job I thought I was very good at a week after buying a new car. The last year was very bad by any metric.

I don't know what I'm feeling right now. Some days I feel worse mentally than ever, even worse than when I was dropping out of college. However, I got a new job a few weeks ago by just showing up some place and asking for a job from the VP of a fairly large local company. I even asked for significantly more money than I was making at my last job. My new coworkers have noted to me that I'm incredibly sociable, funny, and fun to talk to. I've always been a quiet person, and normally keep to myself, so comments like that struck me as odd. I've gone out for drinks with a buddy of mine and I'm striking up conversations with random people. I don't do that. I'm reaching out to family a lot more, spending time with my aunts and uncles, reaching out to old friends, etc. Every day I'm calling an old friend on the drive home, or stopping at my uncle's house, or doing something social.

I'm shaking hands, I'm smiling, I'm making jokes, but I don't feel like I'm real. People say how happy I seem now. I don't feel like anything past last March is real. Everyone else think I'm doing great. I don't even know what to call this.

Morning anxiety/panic,1,1.0,"Since last year I have been waking up with terrible anxiety.

This absolutely destroyed my mental health for the longest time. I woke up with so much panic every day I felt paralyzed for hours.

I’m terrified about going to court (I was hit by a car walking home in 2020 and I’m still dealing with this) and I’m struggling so much at work (I’ve been written up multiple times). I end up just calling out a lot.

It's like I can't raise my voice even one bit above a normal speaking tone or at a slightly quicker pace then casual conversation without them assuming I am emotional in some manner. I have read every book I can on the topic of communication and interpersonal relationships, and it STILL continues to happen. I am currently trying to advance in my career and have been told flat out by my boss that my colleagues don't like my behavior, so I would not be their choice for management. I watch other colleagues tell the exact same people the same thing and they don't get regarded that way. So it's something about me.

Overall I feel like I don't belong in this world. It's like the way I communicate is received completely different than how I intend it. No matter how hard I work on my communication, I continuously get feedback that, essentially, I'm mean or bitchy. I feel like it's affecting my career plus any personal relationships.

 How will I manage without my parents when I’m barely managing with them?,1,1.0,"Hi,

I’m writing here partly to vent, and partly in hope of finding some guidance or even just a shared experience. I’m a 30 YO male and for over 15 years, most of my weekends have been a blur of binge drinking, drugs, and blackouts. I smoke weed every night and whenever I kick one addiction I replace it by another. Despite having a very well-paying job and the potential for financial independence, I spend my earnings as soon as it comes in.

Every summer, after months of excess, I hit a breaking point. I manage to sober up for about 30-50 days—during these stretches, I feel alive. I dive into breathwork and meditation, feeling waves of clarity and wellness washing over me. But no matter what, I slide back into my old patterns. Each relapse hits harder, sinking me into deep, crippling anxiety that makes even the simplest meditation session seem insurmountable.

On my good days, I see myself as someone who genuinely wants to help—friends, strangers, animals—it doesn’t matter. But there are times when I’m anything but good; I can be very deceptive, a big liar to myself and those around me. The shift to remote work during the pandemic only deepened my isolation, surrounded by friends who are, like me, functional addicts, except for a lucky few who’ve found a way out, mostly through relationships.

Physically, I'm active, exercising 5-6 times a week. I've tried new hobbies to combat my severe ADHD and distract from my hyper-short attention span worsened by endless scrolling through my phone. Occasionally, there are glimpses of real happiness, fleeting moments where I feel genuinely content and full of life goals and aspirations. Yet, I’m stuck, not knowing how to maintain this happiness or reach those goals.

In the last weeks I learned that both my parents’ have terminal illnesses, this is a very very dark cloud overshadowing everything. It’s made me terrified of the future, I am really scared of myself. How will I manage without them when I’m barely managing with them?

I’ve considered moving countries as a fresh start next year, but it feels like I’d just be running from my problems, which would inevitably follow me. Therapy seems like an obvious solution, but my deep distrust of the confidentiality of therapy (my background in IT has left me very very skeptical about the security of personal data in therapeutic settings.) and an inability to respect a therapist who doesn’t meet my for sure skewed standards of success (wealth, intelligence) prevent me from seeking it. I am a very sceptical critical thinker which makes it really hard for me to trust peoples competence even when they have good intentions (I am not saying I myself have this competence, I do not).

Words truly cannot express how scared I am, I have never been so scared in my life.

How do I prevent myself from falling down a very deep and dark hole after my parents death when I already can't handle myself right now?

**TLDR: Stuck in a 15-year cycle of addiction and self-destruction, got the news I was scared for for years; both my parents have a terminal illness, feeling lost on how to move forward.

Anxiety and Panic around dating/relationships,1,1.0,"I 32M seem to have serious commitment issues due to my anxiety. 

I've never been in a long term relationship, my longest is 3 months. I just feel smothered and cagey when I'm with someone. The reason for making this post is, I met this girl from Tinder, really sweet, cute and nice person all around. 

We went on our first date yesterday and chose to go on a 4km about an hour from my house. Now I personally would have preferred a walk and a coffee but I thought why not. We got lunch, kissed quite a bit and I brought her home. 

All good right? I thought so too. So before we met up she had been talking about doing all sorts of stuff, swimming, camping, hiking, making me dinner etc. Now while that sounds awesome and like I said, she is a wonderful person. After the hiking and driving for the day yesterday I might be just tired but she wants me to stay at her place tomorrow night, then go swimming friday, go on another trip Saturday and I find myself panicking and needing to breathe. I've explained how I think it's just too much too fast and she's been great about it.

Another factor that could possibly be causing my anxiety is I started doing a couch to 5k running plan about 6 weeks ago and I went for the hike on my rest day. I normally do run/rest alternating. 

So maybe the fact I'm reintroducing exercise and didn't give my body enough time to rest is a part of it? Because I really was glowing when I got home yesterday.

I made some mistakes there but the big one was when I was turning to the gas station again and then i turned too fast, I didn’t hit anything it was empty but I was degraded and cursed out for the entire ride home and then some

I don't understand what's happening to me ,1,1.0,"  Nothing excites or pleases me. I feel agitated by almost everything. I've always been depressed but these feelings seem amplified lately. I don't like it but I don't know how to stop it. I miss feeling normal. I miss being happy. I'm exhausted. I'm so exhausted. I keep finding myself fantasizing about about ending all of it but I won't because I believe it would be a cowardly thing to do (for me specifically, I don't believe people who have taken their lives were cowards in any way) or i just simply wishing to cease existing (to just erase my life as whole from the world and everyone's mind, in a way that my loved ones won't hurt from it). I'm starting to believe that the world is just not worth living my life in, the people in it especially. Everything going on in the world is more stressful to even try understand than the last. I'm too weak to change things on my own and even if I could change things it's far too late to be able to. I didn't ask to be alive, I've felt this way since I was 5. I'm a 27 y/o native male born and raised on the east side of Vancouver bc. And I don't want to witness more harm being inflicted into our mother, not again. I can't handle losing a mother again. When my mom died when I was 12 I began to see the whole situation as my mother and our mother/earth has become one in the same (""a super mother"") I used to say. My mom was abused extensively and fell into depression and drugs which ended up taking her life. I can't stand to see the world do the same thing to her all over again. Every time I go out it hurts more and more. I don't know what to do. There's so much going on and I don't want to think about it. The world keeps spinning and isn't going to allow me to shut it all out. I feel no curiosity or excitement for tomorrow and for what's to come. I feel no joy in talking about what I love with whom I love. I feel the parts of me chipping away or fading out. My energy , my mind , my heart they're all just wanting to give up and I don't know why. I've felt this way since I was 5 but it's becoming too much. I miss feeling normal.

Offering my advice,0,0.5,"Hello and Hi, 🤗 

Short background on myself. Been going to behavioral therapists and psychologists for over twenty years now as a patient. Tons of trips to wards and hospitals. Multiple diagnosis but the medication for bipolar 1, Anxiety and Depression seems to do the trick these days...

Through my years of trial and error I've discovered quite a few prolific moments that I can guarantee helped me out in one way or another and I'd like to share them. They're all holistic in nature.

1st. The biggest. Had a group therapy session at a Ward where the male nurse who came in sat his papers down looked at all of us and said ""You are not your mental illness""
Never needed to hear anything more after spending years around people who acted like who I was during an episode was who I truly was on the inside side. They almost had me believing it myself.

2nd. Just because some body is offering help doesn't mean they actually can help. Read your person and be honest with them. I had way too many caring people take me in and then demand perfection from me. Wake up at 6 a.m. everyday, quit smoking, don't stay up too late. Is that a piece of paper on the ground in your room? 
I've had to tell many thanks but no thanks. Somehow they misconstrue helping you with trying to take control over your entire life for you. 
Their hearts are in the right place, they just can't properly help.

3rd. Be honest with your interactions with psychologists. Don't try to act crazier than you are it won't get you any more help and will probably get you on the wrong prescriptions.
They will work with you, assess how the medications are working and express them.
I can't count how many 3 day pink slips I had from A. Being belligerent and b. Telling the doctors what they wanted to hear so I could be released.
If you're already in there, stay in there, get your medications level and if you aren't comfortable to be released let them know and tell them why. 

4th and I hate to say it but quit telling anyone and everyone about your mental illness. I understand wanting to destigmatize or fully believing in your heart that it's destigmatized but the truth is. It isn't. You will be alienated, people will try to use it against you and yes even if you're honest once known any little blurb will be taken out of context and bosses and managers will use it as a reason to fire you at the drop of a hat.
Everyone gets mad, but if you're bipolar and you get mad... Well.. that means you got mad for no reason and it's because you're mentally unsound.

Just saying be careful. I know social media makes it look like it's cool and loving and... Profitable but it's the very opposite in real life.

Anyways that's it. Not sure if this'll even get posted but it was nice to type it out and remind myself of a few lessons learnt. 

Peace and Good luck.

"I honestly don't know what the cause of my depression is, this makes it so difficult to battle it",1,1.0,"My depression primarily manifests itself as incredibly high physical tiredness. I am essentially bedridden: I wake up after 9 hours of sleep (bad sleep, I am taking melatonin and without it, it would be even worse) and spend practically all my day in bed. I am a PhD student, so I can do the work I need to do in bed on my laptop (I still do the bare minimum required though). I think I spend in total 18-20 hours in bed every day. 

I am hardly caring about personal hygiene. Brushing my teeth is a challenge. I only take a shower once a week, because I just don't have the energy to take it regularly. 

I try to drink coffee and energy drinks, but they don't really help. Even if they do, they just help for 30 minutes. I always feel dizzy and have a headache. It's like having the flu but not actually having it.

Now to the mental suffering. I am pissed off because of pretty much anything. I don't show it externally though, I am keeping all the hate, anger and sadness inside of me. Why? Because everyone around me is already depressed, or at least has a mental problem. We are poor, we live in a country which just looks poor - even the buildings in the bigger cities are just not maintained and it looks like crap. I know this sounds like a childish rant, but I hate eating the same lunch for 3 days which tastes absolutely bland. I only eat to fill my stomach, not because I enjoy it. 

I am constantly trying to find CBT workbooks online but can't seem to find one which I could do on my own and help myself with that. As I said, I'd rather buy some food with the money we have instead of spending it on a psychiatrist right now.

Husband cannotMys manage Anxiety ,1,1.0,"My husband’s anxiety has gotten worse in the last few years. I stay at home with our two young kids and he works from home. He will scroll through social media/the news and his anxiety escalates.

. For example, there was a recent shooting in a town near us. Naturally he was anxious about this and started questioning me about what our plan is for these situations and should he go out and buy a gun for protection. He said maybe I shouldn’t go out with the kids by myself. 

He also gets stressed out with work, the kids being too loud/not listening,just generally when he is overwhelmed by multiple responsibilities or stimuli. Again, very natural imo but he cannot recognize when he is getting stressed until he visibly getting upset. When he upset it’s 50/50 if he can manage the stress or anxiety in a healthy way. Unhealthy being shouting, kicking things, slamming doors, and cursing at me or the wind. 

I want to validate his concerns and feelings because I understand what it is like to be anxious. Actually a few years ago he said that my own anxiety was burdening the relationship and I needed to go to therapy to work on myself. I agreed, went for a few years, and now I can recognize my triggers, thought patterns, and make a plan to work through the emotions. 

I told him he needs to go to therapy to do the same. He said he is reading self help books to work on himself, but I told him it’s not working. Has anyone had a partner like this? Any advice at all?

Additionally, my emotional development is about two decades behind. I'm very timid and passive, which I got from my mother, who is also on the spectrum.

To give you an idea of my slow emotional development, I didn't start masturbating until I was 15-ish. Didn't even think to start until I saw ""There's Something About Mary."" The ""cleaning the pipes scene"" is what drove me to try it.

I'm moderately attractive, so over the years, I had numerous opportunities to have sex, but didn't pick up on social cues very well. Plus, for whatever reason, I wasn't 100% driven to have sex. On the surface, I really wanted to have sex, but it's like my heart wasn't totally in it. It's very frustrating, and it's not something I think I'll ever be able to forgive myself for.

I wholeheartedly believe I’m an innately bad person,5,1.0,"Something in me truly believes I'm an inherently bad person. I know I'm smart and I know this shouldn't be true, but the feeling is so genuine. For example, I was on a call the other day and the person was so kind to me. He told me good things happen to good people and I smiled at him but didn't take it personally. Immediately my heart knew that statement wasn't meant for me. ""I'm not a good person"". I feel it deep in my heart, I'm just not deserving of good karma. I'm not a good person. Logically, that can't be true, I'm actually not a bad person. But I feel it so strongly. I'm not sure why, probably things growing up. Maybe it's my personality too. I just.. genuinely struggle and even stop myself from thinking I'm good. When I do, I get a bad feeling, like I'm doing something incredibly wrong. Other people are good and I'm not. People who are perceptively worse than me are still better than me. For example, the people who bullied me deserve good karma, but I don't despite never having done what they did. I just think I'm innately terrible. Like someone born with so much sin. Sometimes I wonder if I'm some sort of consequence of my mother having been terribly abused growing up. As if I'm a product of generational trauma and it's etched into my DNA, something I cannot get rid of. I think what I mean by this is that I carry so much pain in my heart despite not going through as much as my mom did. Like the trauma I experienced was much lesser, yet had the same large impact as my mom's did on her. My mom is a very angry and stubborn woman and I suppose that's how she copes. I don't cope, I just fall apart. And as for my personality.. years of this have turned me into a shell, but what scares me is when I show negative emotions. Whenever I get angry and yell at someone I immediately think ""that's it again, you're inherently bad and the real you escaped again"". It's as if that's all I am and ever will be. Someone who is angry, bitter, jealous. That's how I was as a kid. I was a very envious kid and prideful. I liked feeling better than the other kids. I got great pride and joy out of feeling superior in many ways. I was also very self-righteous; if you did me wrong, that's on you entirely (though now I can recognize it as an anxious avoidant attachment style). For some reason I can't accept the idea that that was normal childish behavior. To me that just tells me there was something wrong with me from the start. I was broken from the start and therefore there's no redemption or ability to change. 'That's what I am and all I'll ever be'. Though sometimes I wonder how things would've been if I had been born a boy or in a different culture. Maybe my attitude wouldn't have been so shamed by the people around me growing up.

I was also very cheerful and had this positive outlook in life for the past few months. However, this June, last week, my mood suddenly drops. I just become this sad. And I felt like I don't wanna live anymore. I don't wanna do anything even for myself. I still eat though because I am conscious about what other people say about me if I suddenly show that I am now like this so I recently pretended as if I am still my old self. However, I am no longer okay. I often think about me 3nding my l1fe in various ways. It's kind of heavy to carry. My unwillingness to live affects my productivity and I still have things to do for my studies. My motivation just went from 100 to 0.

I really need help and advice...,1,1.0,"I am so sorry for the clickbait title, but I am genuinely in deep despair and I don't know who to reach for anymore. I feel deeply alone. I have no suicidal thoughts (at least none that I can't handle until now), but I am losing hope and interest in well... anything. **The point of this post is to ask for advice upon battling depression (and general mental illness). I feel powerless. Let me explain everything here - if you don't feel like reading all of it, you can still just tell me what helped you in the past if you overcame depression.**

For context : I am a 29YO woman living in France. I have been diagnosed with depression 4 years ago. At that time, my little sister had cancer (for a couple years at this moment) and we all knew the outcome would be her passing. She died one year later, so three years ago. And even though I think her illness and death triggered my mental disorder, I think it was already here since I was a child. My therapist tells me that I was ""an early child"" (not sure of the word though), as I learned how to read when I was 4, and I skipped first grade which triggered me a lot and made me very insecure with other people. I've been on and off antidepressants ever since my sister got ill. I am currently on Prozac, which helps me a lot on good days, but barely keeps me standing on bad ones. I'm more and more afraid that I will never heal and never know what is a ""normal"" state of mind.

I have always had eating disorders as well (mostly bulimia), and when my depression is fully on, I feel the need to eat just to stop feeling empty inside. I've been losing and gaining a lot of weight over the past 4 years. Also, my brain is always so scattered. I have a million things late to do, but I can't do them. Don't ask me why. I really don't know. I feel freezed and paralysed. I often discover new hobbies, give all my energy as I learn them, spend a lot of money in books and tools... But I also get bored of everything in a blink of an eye. In other words, I am either passionate about one thing or terribly depressed because I am not anymore. I have a very high sensibility, and always have had. I love that part of me, because I feel everything in a very rough and extreme way, and I have come to accept that my own palette of emotions is vast and hard to handle. But lately, I feel like I don't own my emotions anymore and it pains me a lot. I don't get these rushes of light anymore, only darkness.

The point is, I am at that point of my life that I don't fucking know what to do. Will depression go away ? What caused it in the first place ? Do I truly love that man ? Should I leave my boyfriend ? Am I capable of love ? Can I be loved for who I really am ? Will life will EVER be sweet ? Am I just fated to be sad, anxious and lonely forever ?  
So what I am asking here is for advice. If you ever battled with depression, if you ever encountered this state of despair. A good friend of mine told me that she overcame depression when she finally found something that makes sense (as to her, she adopted four dogs and never felt more happy in her life). But I can't seem to find what my own magic wand is.

How to help someone who doesn’t want it ,1,1.0,My husband has PTSD TBI and anxiety and depression as a result. He is prescribed medication by a VA psychiatrist but doesn’t take it. He says he doesn’t want them to stop his benefits so he accepts the meds but refuses to actually use them. He insists that weed is his Medicine. Well that isn’t working any more. His bouts of anxiety and depression are getting worse. I am doing my best to be supportive and give him what he needs on the bad days and keep spirits up on the good days.  I never can have my own “bad days” and I really feel like I can’t burden him anymore with any of “my stuff”. He won’t take meds and he stoped therapy a number of years ago when that therapist left the VA. He won’t get back into therapy and he won’t take any medication. I have no tools and am just at a loss. I feel responsible for him and am losing myself in the mix. It’s putting so much tension in our relationship because where I used to feel like I could talk to him about anything I can’t say a word now. I feel really alone and isolated and also feel like I need to give up any thoughts of what our future might look like. I carry so much weight already for the two of us we can’t have kids like this but I also cannot and would not leave him during this.

do everything for others but nothing for myself (long),1,1.0,">!(sorry for bad english, also didn't wanted it to be this long)!<
I've been struggling with productivity since my attempt at 13-14 y. old. 
I had lots of hobbies before, mostly arts, and were able to do all of them. Then things happened and my hobbies started to disappear. 
It wasn't like i didn't like or want to do them anymore, i CRAVED all of them, but couldn't make myself to do them. 
I dropped lots of hobbies. I thought i was burned out cause of the amount. It didn't help. 

At 16 i started to have troubles with everything else. School, friends, hygiene. I also was horribly sleepy all the time, falling asleep at random times and places.

At 18 old sleepiness was gone, so was i. I stayed home for almost 5 years. I was avoiding everything because of shame of not being able to do anything. Self harm started and several attempts happened during this time. But i kept living, because i promised myself to **survive until 25**.

Then my mom (narc probably, it's a different story) found me a job. I was sure I'm gonna fail. I didn't like it, it was min wage, it required a degree and social skills i didn't have. 

It's been 2 years. 
Ironically, i was unofficial director of the company that whole time. My boss take advantage of me, gave all her responsibility to me.  I was living and SUFFERING at that job.
I did so many things that i felt real burnout. Working on weekends, vacation and even when sick without being paid. I thought i deserved it because i couldn't finish things in time. Then i was told that i have too many thing to do. Then i realized I'm getting paid less then our sanitary workers. 

It's been 2 weeks of freedom. 
I thought that after leaving my job i will get better, at least i will start to do my last 2 hobbies that i droped while working. 
But i feel horrible. 
I'm struggling with everything again like if these last 2 years never happened. I didn't change at all. 

I crave to do things. I have ideas. I have motivation. But it seems that i can do things only when I'm forced or when it's done for someone else but not for me. 

I don't know what to do. 
I don't even know why I'm posting this.

I don't feel girls anymore the way I used to. especially I can't love anyone with pure intentions.,1,1.0,"I'm a 22M. I used to feel so heart warmed when I see my crush in early teenage. even after few heartbreaking scenes, I still used to feel ""love"" and romantic feelings as a normal person. but after my 2nd break up I felt depressed so bad. since it was COVID period and I had to face my A/levels it was a huge deal. I even had a liver failure and several physical health issues those days.

but I didn't give up. I raised my self up and overcame everything. I even dated a new girl which was used to be my crush in past. but that's when things started to get weird.

I tried to make her falling in love with me and after few weeks of flirting she said she loves me. as soon as I heard that, I felt nothing. all the feelings I had towards her, all the emotions and dreams I had. they all were gone. but I make up my mind and pushed my self to express love towards her artificially since I thought I'm just confused at that time.

few months later we broke up. she said there's no specific reason for that and she just needed to stop this. it was so sad and I just overcame the situation after almost a year.

now here's the thing. I got two requests during this month. two girls asked me out. these girls are very good looking and even one of them is a model. but I don't feel anything. no I'm not still thinking abt my ex or something. it's just I don't feel anything after those COVID period. even during my last relationship I tried to simulate these feelings so I can become normal again. but my ex showd me that it's not that easy. I can't go for a relationship unless I'm honest with them. I feel sexual feelings towards girls sometimes but definitely not love.

how can I be normal again? going for a relationship doesn't work as it seems. it only makes me feel more miserable.

you remember past actions of guilt but others dont?,2,1.0,"I am a 20 year old male and have large regret over past actions. I grew up with a severe porn addiction and have to fight it everyday today. I am going to be as vague as possible for the sub's sake. Any memory before ages 15 ish I don't remember that well aside for a few happy memories like eating out at a special restaurant. However, I have a vivid memory of sometime in the past doing attempting to an act (not following through thankfully) to someone I deeply care about and love and that anytime I think about that memory I feel almost paralyzing guilt.  We are on great terms though and we go see movies, games, etc and stuff together and he acts as if nothing happened. I decided however that not acknowledging it was worse for me so about a month ago I put all my courage into talking to the person I did this to to ask for forgiveness. However, they say they have 0 idea of what I am talking about but still forgive me. This rocked me as it was such a traumatic and vivd memory for me that haunts me to this day. This made me think about it. The 2 instances where it occurred I can with confidence say the details of the encounter. However, outside of that, that whole era of my life is kinda blurry and feels more like a dream then reality. This is making me question  A LOT of my childhood and teenage years.

I can't feel anything,1,1.0,"Hi, it's my first time posting here so I'm kind of nervous. I'm currently sick right now and I've known this for a while— but I haven't really felt like looking for advice about it until today. If I were asked, I'd probably trace back the time where I completely gave up on life when I was an adolescent. A multitude of things happened during that incredibly formative year (apart from being a stage where people commonly start developing mental health issues.)  I used to be an incredibly emotional child and I felt a lot of things so deeply I was known in my family for being a crybaby, I would actually feel my heartstrings being pulled if there ever were such a thing. 

The pandemic happened, isolation, breakdown of friendships, you get the gist. And I suddenly found myself being a complete husk of a person. I'm completely incapable of feeling fulfilled, every happy moment I experience feels incredibly shallow, and I can't seem to hold any interest or passion in anything. I have given up on trying at anything I would otherwise want to succeed at because I always expect failure, and I figure it's better to not try than to care a lot and be disappointed in return. I don't feel particularly connected to any social circles, my relationship with my family is supbar, and sometimes I find myself hating my own friends. I feel like a dead log just passively going along where the current takes me.


I always thought it must be depression or something, but I don't really plunge into bouts of deep despair or anything like that. I've never had a genuine desire to kill myself. It's just been a stagnant cycle of emptiness I can't seem to escape from. Frankly I'm getting sick of all the self pity and the isolation and the wallowing, it used to be something that burdened me, now it just makes me sick of myself. I just want to like myself again. To anyone who's struggled with this, did you ever make it out? Or will it always be like this forever? I miss being myself, I loved writing and daydreaming, I don't daydream about anything these days. Sorry if this is too long, I never really sat down to put all of this into words.

I woke up crying and breaking down because I never found a best friend not even in college. ,0,0.5,I ran out of chances.

Dealing with mental health without medications,1,1.0,"I find that so many people very casually talk about taking anti depressants, anxiety meds and adderall. 

I struggle with my mental health at times - I was once diagnosed with BPD years back from a mental health crisis I had due to a toxic relationship. I am typically fine but have certain triggers that will send me into an emotional wreck with uncontrollable (and scary) reaction to pain or betrayal. Abandonment issues, etc etc.  

I’ve never considered going on medication because I want to be able to work through my issues without it. I understand everyone has different levels of traumas and mental health illnesses, but it is alarming to me how many people are on medications (multiple medications). 

Can someone provide some insight as to why these are so common? Are they being over prescribed? Are we finding the root cause of these illnesses? 

 If you’re on it, what made you make that decision? Has it helped?

If you choose to not be on medications, why?

I hate my life,2,1.0,I have thought about self harm a lot. The reason my life is so fucked up is all my fault. I distance myself from everyone. I just can't really seem to care. I drop people without even thinking. I've done that too much and now I have almost no one. I struggle at making new friends because I'm anti social and awkward. I'm an introvert. Everyone that I've had relationships with has come to me. I had a girlfriend and after 4 months of dating I still felt like she was a stranger to mem I just can't seem to connect with people. I almost never cry or really feel anything besides anger and insecurity. I know I don't look bad but I still hate the way I look. I hate everything about myself and pick myself apart. I've had really bad mental health issues since a child. My dad has terrible mental health too but I think mine may be worse.

Feeling lonely need someone to talk to me regularly,0,0.5,"Hello all, I'm an Indian guy(24) living in Germany for my studies. I'm not good with the German language and don't have many friends here. I used to be in a friend group, but it hurt me a lot. The group was from my home region speaking the same language. As a result, I didn't try to interact with others and make friends, even in English. I'm afraid of talking to people in person. I pushed myself to go out and meet people, but my efforts were never enough. I'm anxious about my financial status, although I have enough savings approx. for the next 4 months. I'm done with my studies and looking for a job, which is frustrating. Even experienced people are finding it difficult to get a job, and I'm just a fresher. I'm feeling too low and not confident in myself. I get professional help through online therapy from India. My therapist speaks the same regional language and English. I'm confused about therapy. Do I really need it? Is she the right therapist for me? Is it working? I've done 10 sessions, and booking further ones is a struggle. Due to my financial anxiety, I doubt booking new sessions and end up booking only when I'm at my worst. I'm not consistent. I got an excessive bill for my SIM card and think of it as punishment. My brother and parents are supportive and said they will help financially after 3 months, but I feel too ashamed to ask. I started therapy after my first breakup around Feb 2024. I'm over it now, but it still hits me occasionally. My ex is getting married in August 2024, and I'm afraid to face it. We lived in the same city in Germany, and I still live here. She moved to India. The city, trains, places, and things make me uneasy sometimes. I'm afraid to go to certain places, worried they will trigger memories. Right now, I don't have many friends and long for a hug. I feel like if I get a job, everything will be alright. I can spend money on simple pleasures without guilt and enjoy paid experiences. I live alone and haven't been cooking, just passing days sitting in bed, watching YouTube, playing phone games, eating snacks, drinking tea in the morning, and making a bread omelet when really hungry. I long for someone to be there for me, for love and affection. I know I need to go out and meet people, but I'm staying in my room.

Whenever I'm doing something--anything at all--I'm usually thinking, ""what would people think about me?"" or even, ""what would my crush think about me?""

We do most things together pretty much. I consider them my closest friend. Both me and them have always struggled with mental health issues and they have noticeably began struggling more lately. It’s horrible because I can see the pain they are in. They are mean to me sometimes because of it. I’ve never really held it against them because I know what they’re going through, though I tell them if they step over a line and they always apologize profusely and try to respect that line. They are struggling so deeply. I’ve done things very similar to them in a similar mental state so I know what it’s like. They’ve always said shit that can “hurt my feelings” but it’s never been like this. It was always friendly jabs, and it usually still is, but I can see they’re in pain and are actively trying to push me away now. I can tell the difference. I can see how badly they’re struggling. They keep saying they think we should talk less and other things trying to push me away because they are afraid they’re gonna hurt me with what they say. They just don’t wanna hurt me. It just makes me worry for them because I know they don’t mean the things they sometimes say. I’ve told them this but they still seem like they don’t believe it. I think they think it affects me more (on like a personal level) than it does. Really I just worry for them. I want to be able to help somehow because god knows they’ve helped me through it when I’ve gone through the same. But they just seem like they truly do not believe they can improve.

Update

Hey guys, I just wanted to give you guys a update. First of all, thank you so much for everything, I was literally crying with how much support random people we're willing to help me. I apologize if I didn't responded to any of your comments, but Once again thank you so much.

So I did had a mental breakdown of sorts, it started when my boyfriend and I were talking and he suggested that we can move in together, despite knowing I want to live on my own for a bit.(he was trying to help, not pressure or guilt trip me at all. He also has a tendency to forget things when excited, will talk to him about it.) it resulted in me writing a letter to my folks since they weren't exactly listening. 

Then it resulted in the meltdown, but my parents and I talked and hugged it out, and dad even suggested he would pay for my solo trip. I declined because I wanted to do things my way(but will keep in mind for the future,lol). Plus he reminded me that I still have time and I can start with community college then get the bachelors, then finally get my masters if I want. I love my parents so much, and I love my boyfriend, I've just been so stressed about everything, trying to be perfect for both of them. Maybe sometime on my hobbies and doing a 'not being judgmental 'week challenge on my artwork is what I need.

Once again, thank you so much everyone!

Lamictal vs Abilify,1,1.0,"22 F, Just received a BPD + C-PTSD diagnosis at my psych appt yesterday.
Also diagnosed with PMDD, OCD, Anxiety + OCPD traits.

Currently on 60mg Fluoxetine, 5mg Diazepam PRN and 4.5mg Naltrexone.
Never tried other psych meds.

Fluoxetine considerably decreased OCD and anxiety although still majorly anxious. LDN is for PMDD… don’t know if it does anything. The valium really helps my agitation/dissociation/anxiety but obviously not a long-term fix.

Most problematic symptoms atm (listed in order of severity):
- mood swings (both Interpersonal/abandonment related and PMDD related  
- dissociation/emptiness
- suicidality
- anger, agitation, self-harm
- anxiety
- obsessive thinking/perfectionism
- paranoia only from high stress

All these symptoms and the constant cycling make me very depressed and hopeless, I have no relationships, am constantly tired, have no life… just wish I wasn’t alive overall. My behaviours all get in the way of therapy progressing as I’m constantly being triggered and derailing.

My psych offered me the choice of adding Lamictal or Abilify. We didn’t have much time discuss this in detail. Can someone help me make an informed decision. Why she chose these, comparisons, what’s better for what symptoms, side effects, helpful articles/studies etc?

High school graduate in need of help ,1,1.0,"High school graduate in need of help

Hi guys! This is my first post lol. I’m going to try my best to cut to the chase. I graduated high school on Thursday and every day since during the majority of my free time I’ve been anxious and upset. The main reason why I feel this way is because I wanted this summer to be fun and social, but I’m faced with the reality that I don’t have a close friend group or the car needed for me to start things myself. I luckily made some real friends toward the end of my senior year and I’ve expressed my desire to hang out with them, but I’m scared nothing will happen. 

How can I make the most out of this summer and the friends I can become closer with?

My past unintentional solution was to spend most of my time on my own but I’m tired of it. A lot of the time was spent uselessly scrolling so I deleted Snapchat and have an app which limits my screen time on other social media. I  have other hobbies I want to do more often like cooking. I am considering working more often too because money is money and it makes me focus on something else, but I’ve realized that I am just distracting myself from the real issue by doing all these things. Alone time did work to keep me happy once, but now it is being overused when I really want to go out and have fun.  

I am really at a loss of what to do because I am going to college in under three months. Is it worth trying to have fun with friends or should I just focus on doing other things to fill my time in the meanwhile? 

I think I need therapy at this point but I am in the same predicament. Get a therapist now and have three months with them or wait until college starts?

TW: Mentions of mental health issues

I (16NB) have had a bit of a struggle with my MH and I think it's caused me to lose my mind a little bit. 

As all children do, I used to make up fake scenarios on my head, and I had imaginary friends. Except, I never really grew out of this. I know they're fake, but I find myself picturing and acting out completely separate lives everyday. Even down to the choices I make. (eg. If I'm choosing something, I choose what my ""self"" in one of my scenarios would do.) It's gotten to the point where these fake realities and scenarios feel more like real life than my actual life does. I've used them as an escape from life for so long, but I really wanna stop doing this. 

I act out scenes from these scenarios when I'm alone too, and it's gotten to such a point that I worry I'm losing my mind. Speaking to a professional is out of the question so jm afraid there's nothing I can do. Does anyone have any advice? 

(Sorry if parts don't make sense, I'd be happy to clarify anything in the comments)

What do you do when you realize there’s nothing?,8,1.0,"I have been struggling with depression for most of my life. I have been on and off many different medications with little success.

I (27F) feel disgusted with myself for wanting to be with my now amazing boyfriend (27M),1,1.0,"Me (27F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together for 3.5Y. This was my first relationship and in the beginning of this relationship it was casual for the first 2-3 months, in that time we were both in college and my boyfriend was busy with college sports events so we didn't see each other often.

However when we did meet it was usually him coming over to my hostel room and we would end up horny but it was usually just me waking him off and he'd leave after claiming he had already told me he didn't have much time, which was true but when it was him getting wanked off and we were ""over the time"" he'd still make enough time to come and then just leave.

I almost never came in those times and he wouldn't even try to get me off and when I voiced this he would say that he already told me that he can't stay for long and he had to go for practice. That obviously felt shitty so I confronted him then, ""do you just come here to get off?"", he said no he came here to see me and that just happened. And then some time after our summer internships started so we didn't see each other for around 3 months. Post that it was not like that but there were still some expectation mismatch which we were able to work through eventually. 

Now we both have graduated and have decent jobs and are living together. Yesterday we came back from my doctor's visit and we just wanted to relax and not worry about my health for a break, so he rolled us a couple joints and we were smoking and watching the boys and something came up on the tv which reminded me of the beginning days of our relationship and I just asked him point blank, were you just using me in the beginning of our relationship and he didn't say anything for a while and then he said that he didn't remember that but no he was not, he was being very social so he didn't have a lot time but it was never like that and he kind of brushed it off.

From his POV he didn't brush it off, he tried to reassure me and went back to watching boys, but I can't help but feel he didn't really care and doesn't care right now, but from his perspective he does care and is trying to tell me no it wasn't like that also it was more than 3 years ago. I just feel disgusted with myself for staying instead of just leaving him at that point.

I don't know what to do now, I know he's nothing like that right now and we love each other but I just feel grossed out with myself not putting my mental well-being first and this feels like shit, I don't know how to get over this. I want to go back to feeling cuddly with each other but I just feel grossed out with myself. I want to get over this and move forward but I just don't know how to.

"I struggle with homicidal ideation, and I think this struggle should be talked about more",6,0.8,"I’ve been struggling with homicidal ideation for over a year. Often it is just just intrusive thoughts, but at the worst, it can be classified as ideation. 

I have reached out for help, and I’ve been able to, which I am so happy about. Through this journey of learning how to manage these thoughts, I’ve looked for resources. There aren’t many. Through my experience, many therapists don’t know how to really handle it either. I opted to contact a specialist. 

Because this is scary and difficult to talk about, there AREN’T resources and there is a lot of mystery for everyone, including those struggling with these thoughts. Wading through this mystery made me feel even more alone and it made me hate myself more.

Talking about it can save people.

Since struggling with this, I’ve learned that it *is* scary, but it is manageable and it can be understood, just like any other serious mental health struggle. 

Feel free to ask me questions. Here’s a basic profile of me if that helps:
1. I’m under 30
2. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar 1 and borderline personality disorder
3. This began with my biggest mental health crisis about a year and a half ago
4. These thoughts are mostly influenced by these three aspects: sexual interest, fear of men, repress anger

I need some advice in regards to my relationship,1,1.0,"I know it may seem from the title that this should be in a different subreddit, but please hear me out first.

My boyfriend suffers from major depression and I'm also somewhat suspecting he may also be autistic, but that's not the point. I've been really struggling with not knowing what to tell him when he also suffers from a lot of derealization. It sucks to see him find difficulty in viewing things as real or authentic. It's been a year of us being together and there have been times where he's isolated himself due to feeling overwhelm (over other events in life), he's even attempted once this year, and lately he has been trying to do better as he really wants to get HRT but even still, he still can't tell what's real or not.

I get these kinds of things happened because of his upbringing and his experiences that shaped him to view things this way, but I don't know how else to help, what do I say to tell him how real everything is, how I'm real and how everyone does want him around. What do I even say when he tells me ""what if I'm immortal and the only way to find out is to kms"". I live worried I'll eventually lose the man I love so much someday.

For most of my life i’ve been having really awful dreams that have increased both in frequency and intensity recently.

They are hyperrealistic, i can read books, watch tv, use phones in them. Its really just a near 1 to 1 copy of real life, and nearly everyday now i’ve been having dreams where i just go about my day until a random point where reality and people break and then i „wake up” and i am putting this in quotation cause i dont actually wake up, i am still in a dream but i get put in my bed, the day is reset and everything repeats again and this keeps looping sometimes even tens of times until i actually wake up screaming and crying.

I dont feel real anymore at all, in fact i even talked about how unreal i feel inside of a dream before so its not even a way to tell it all apart, i dont really know what to do, everything feels like fiction or simulation or some sort of greek tragedy.

Would you say that anyone with healed scars should be allowed to show them in public or only people with mild/moderate levels of healed scars? If that makes sense.

Emotionally numb?,1,1.0,"Hey everyone. I don't know what's happening, but I feel like my emotions have shut off as a sort of self-defence mechanism by my brain. 

Context: This month has been a little rough for me since I wasn't able to clear (a very important) exam. My parents threw a fit, ofc. Although it's been a while, I still think I haven't processed this failure yet, and eventually, when I do, I'll be in a horrible mental state. Today my mom and I had an argument, and I don't feel the way I'm supposed to (angry/sad/frustrated/guilty). Just emotionally numb, unable to process this phase of my life. 

I think I've been trying to block out my emotions as a way to protect myself from the disappointment and pressure. I also struggle with body image issues. I want to try to make my mental and physical health better, I just can't figure out how. 

I'm also extremely busy studying as I'll be taking the same exam next year, and I don't want to burn out. I won't be able to get therapy (my parents don't really believe in the concept of mental health), unless it's online and free.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you <3

My thoughts,1,1.0,"Sitting here at night I can't help but feel a lingering sense of inadequacy, like I'm doing something wrong or something is missing from my life. My heart feels fractured and broken and I'm not sure anything could fix it at this stage; it burns with the memories of unreciprocated love, of merciless abandon. 

I want for what many others want, to fit in. To be normal. To be seen as someone on equal footing as the rest. Alas, I know I will never get that. I am burdened with mental illness, trapped between the obsessive paranoia of anxiety and the quiet psychopathy of depression. I long to be normal, but I know in my heart I never will be. I will always be on the outskirts, never able to cross the boundary into sanity. 

I cry sometimes, sometimes the littlest things will invoke a deep emotion within me. Watching a father hug their children, seeing families reunite after time apart. Sometimes things that shouldn't make me upset at all make me cry. Maybe it's because I never had moments like that with my family, I can only remember the bad times. Listening to my parents fighting, watching my mom being reduced to tears. Trying to protect my young siblings from it all. 

Alcoholism permeates through my family; my father is an alcoholic. He yells and screams and shouts, he breaks things. Sometimes when that happens, I still feel like a little boy, and my anxiety consumes me. I can barely breathe, and my palms start sweating. I hate the way it makes me feel. Weak, helpless. 

I've dabbled in my fair share of substances, if for nothing else than to escape the reality of my situation. Cigarettes, liquor, weed, DXM. Anything just to provide a release from the Hellstorm in my mind. Being high makes me feel normal; no more anxiety, no more depression, no more stress..just me. Me and my own thoughts. It's peaceful, though I wish I didn't have to rely on it.

I feel as if my condition is worsening. Lately I feel like there's two people in my body instead of one. The quiet, reserved and the loud, extroverted. In a more broad sense, I sometimes feel like a character, like someone is controlling my thoughts whenever I'm in that ""other"" state of mind. It doesn't feel like me, like I'm an observer looking in. The paranoia has also grown worse, sometimes it's so bad that I don't even leave my room because I feel like if I do something would get me. I haven't left my home in over a year. I hate being around others but I'm scared to be alone. The silence is loud.

Really getting tempted to end it all forever,1,1.0,"I have been having a rough few years lately. Even though I have posted earlier on multiple subreddit about my declining mental health (I have hidden or deleted them), it's just that I get no response or help. Even my friends don't tend to understand and where I am from, the concept of therapy is still a taboo

I am going to be 27 this 22 June and I feel like I have wasted my life. I hate my life and hate myself. I really wish I could kill myself in a slow but painful manner. My idiot father ruined our family with his business adventures where he burned through all our savings. Now we have nothing left and I have to take care of our family.

I am from Bangladesh and I hate this country. I hate it so much and I want to leave this place and never come back. I have been trying to move to the US and nothing positive is happening. I applied for a few US and Czech universities and got selected to most of them. But I don't have the money to study and live abroad. So, I was looking for a scholarship route. Unfortunately, there is no fellowship and I don't have any publication to get RA position in the US. I did not get any proper guidance or mentorship when I was a student, so I did not know what to do. I am a good student but I didn't know that a profile had to be certain way to get a scholarship. I only cared about getting a good grade.

Nevertheless, I am trying now to get a paper published. I have appeared for GRE once but did terrible, so I might try again. But frankly I am losing. I have no social life left and no girlfriend or love life. I am 27 and I see people getting married or being with the love of my life. Meanwhile, I am leading this pathetic garbage life with no progress still living with my family that I hate so much.

I have sacrificed so much to leave this country. So many outings, so many events so that I can have a good grade, get a good GRE score but it was all a waste of time. I never went for traveling anywhere proper. I broke up with ex because she was becoming a distraction to my goal of leaving Bangladesh.

I have no social life anymore, not anyone to love, never been to anymore. You might suggest me that now I can do that but who is going to help my family and help me prepare for abroad then? I have to juggle between two jobs, working on a publication to survive. I hate this. I hate every second of this. I hate my life so much. I wish I was dead, every second.

I(27m) am an Indian, and my LDR gf(24f) have been together for more than 4 years now. She has a bad relationship with her parents. Her mom has never been supportive of her and been mentally abusive ever since she was a child. Her father is an absolute pathetic person who has never grown up to take any kind of responsibilities in life. He is almost 60 now and has never been able to hold a job even as a janitor. He has been living off of his wife and ever since my gf started working, he has been taking money from her too everymonth. My gf has a lot of trauma from her childhood and especially with her father. She has to live in fear and had to spend many nights out of the house because he would bring friends and get drunk at home. She has been forced to live alone since she was 13 years old and even her family is toxic af. Her only father figure(good father figure) was her uncle and she lost him too to heart attack and the most traumatising thing isnthat he died in front of her, when they were alone at home. Her mom left her to work as an OFW and all of this gave her a lot of trauma and she suffers from seperation anxiety and social anxiety and anger issues(cause she has seen and suffered through a lot of fight between her parents as a kid). Despite all this she built herself to be a strong independent woman, graduated with Dean's list(I'm told it's like summa cum laude). Left her toxic religion, built a career for herself and finally starting to find some peace and stability in life..but now her mom is sending her useless husband to live with her because his previous home( his sister let him use her house till now) is being sold.

Can fiction cause trauma?,0,0.33,"Okay, so... where to even begin with this question... I guess... can emotional attachment to a work of fiction result in trauma? So, backstory I guess, when i was a little kid I loved fiction and cartoons yadda yadda real life was boring to me so I mainly immersed myself in the fictional worlds I saw on tv & read about, I felt more emotional attachment to these worlds than anything in my own life, I was a neurodivergent kid with a major hyperfixation problem so... there was one show I was completely obsessed with, like COMPLETELY. OBSESSED. I lived and breathed that show. Spent all my time watching it or reading fanfic or looking at fanart, again, major hyperfixation problem, it was how I avoided/""coped with"" real life issues and just sort of my happy head space, this went on for like 2 years, woh woh, my favorite character (whom I was VERY emotionally attached to) turned out to be a villain, then died, my little happy mental space fell apart. I went into a state of depression that lasted... quite a while. It's been like 5 years and seeing anything related to that show still gives me this sort of empty, chest-achey feeling. So like...

I'm jealous of my severely mentally ill friend & want to get worse.,1,1.0,"My best friend's mental health has been getting noticeably worse, and she recently opened up more about it. I obviously tried my best to make her feel better, talked with her, etc., and she has thanked me on multiple occasions for being a supportive friend, a sentiment which I obviously appreciate.



But inside, I'm almost blinded by anger and jealousy; in no way am I truly selflessly being supportive. Why? Why do I want her to get better only because that would make my problems seem worse in comparison? I have even started to fantasize about her killing herself, so that I could get attention because my best friend died. I can't stop these feelings. I just want to be the one who ""has it worse"" or something, but I can't even talk about my own struggles because her problems seem much more real or serious than mine.



I have been through a lot of shit too, but most of those events have been, in some way, my fault as well. I hate myself so deeply; I feel like I have no personality at all outside of my diagnoses and addictions etc. I have willingly made myself like this—a hateful, lying person—and I feel like a fraud when the people around me don't understand how awful I actually am. That's why I constantly wish that something bad would happen to me, so I would have something, anything, else to blame besides myself.



I don't know, I think I was getting better too as summer came around, but now after my best friend got worse, I intentionally try to get worse too. Like my OCD, which I had made some progress with, I knowingly reversed it all. Self-harm as well; I don't even really want to hurt myself but do it just to prove something.

Bullied in the workplace ,1,1.0,"I am sharing my current situation in hopes that you all can give me your opinion or thoughts. 

Here’s the situation- I started a new job on April 1st. It is a team of 4 people (myself, my boss, and two other women). One of the women was my friend before I started. I began to sense tension between her and I within the first two weeks on the job. Her behavior was very passive aggressive. I confronted her through text, she responded very rudely which led me to believe she was actually mad at me. This soon turned into her and the other woman actively bullying me in the office through exclusion (both social and work related), extensive whispering and giggling, and passive aggressiveness. I’m pretty sensitive so this took a toll on me early on. Reached out to my Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for counseling and coping skills with the situation, kept documentation, and told my boss. I have continued to keep my boss in the loop and once she finally attempted to address it (my first report was May 2nd, she didn’t bring up intentionally including me until June 6th) this resulted in them becoming defensive and both calling off work the next day. I have been on a pre planned vacation since June 10th, but saw my PCP during my vacation who helped me to take medical leave for my mental health. I have a history of anxiety and depression, am on anti depressants, and have been dealing with another complicated health condition on top of these things. 

So basically I am quitting. While on leave I plan on finding another job and never going back. Every night when I get home I cry for hours. I have stopped taking care of myself and our home. It has destroyed me (my other complicated health condition helped too- its infertility and it’s killing me). EAP can’t even get me in for an intake until June 21st and I just don’t see myself being able to develop the coping skills quickly enough to tough this job out, on top of the infertility treatments.

I don't get excited. I'm not excitable. Really. I get told that something is happening, and I don't dread it or worry either. I'm just there. 

I don't smile. I don't frown or scowl either. People say I look upset. I'm not upset. I'm also not the smiley type.


I don't like seeing family. When I do I just feel like I'm holding my breath. It's at the point where my mom would rather I not come to events. I don't cause trouble, but would also rather not be there. 

I don't like seeing friends or the people who are supposed to be friends by extension of my wife. I saw some the other weekend and couldn't stop thinking about everything I was falling behind at home. Then this week her new job has some mandatory fun next weekend, and I'm still exhausted from seeing people last month. I said no thanks. She said she would take our daughter to the event without me. I said please do.

My work had a luncheon, ie, mandatory fun. I'm a  teacher, and it was the last event before summer. We had to come in just for this mandatory fun, and all I want is to be out of there. The whole time I wondered how and when I could get out. I thought maybe if I fall and jerk my head, the mandatory nonsense would be over
a teacher and it was the last event before summer.  

I don't think I'm depressed.

I used to work out a ton, but then I tore my Achilles a second time. It's been a rough recovery. 

I used to play video games as a me time. Then my wife got pregnant and we had to move to a new house. Then we had a daughter. I love my daughter, but I haven't played video games since when I moved.

There's constant work to do in this house, and if I let the grass grow too much, it'll be more of a pain to mow. Two weekends in a row it rained, and when I finally mowed it was way too long. I also killed a baby bird by accident since I couldn't see it in the high grass. I don't want that to happen again.

My HVAC unit went out in March.. Replacing it was 30g. I know. A few weeks later, my wife's junker car required 2k to fix, and it seemed more reasonable to finally get a car that would help the baby. Suddenly two more payments a month. 
Then two weeks later she got a good review on Tuesday and was fired Friday. 

It took two months for her to get a new job. In the meantime I was picking up all kinds of side gigs and tutoring hours.

My life is shit,1,0.67,"I don’t know wether to cry or fight. 
I’ve been home alone all weekend since my wife is out of state visiting her family and so far I have actually been able to hang out with friends publicly in places such as restaurants and bars which is as very rare unless it was with the two friends and of ours that live with us (unfortunately) I love them but it’s fucking hard. But with that being said I feel I have made some bad choices in the process. I don’t smoke but I bought cigarettes to smoke at the bar I went too alone after I was done playing pool with some friends (former co-workers) and after the at I went to a little honky Toni bar for karaoke and decided not to wear my wedding ring since me and my wife have been having some issues lately. Not a good reason I know but I did it anyway then I made the mistake of going to the strip club alone(not sure it was a mistake but I feel icky now) and haven’t told anyone but a good friend who is a bar manager. My wife comes home Monday and although we have actually spoken some in the last few days I still feel weird at this point in my life. My wife has always made lesbian jokes since we have been together but here lately it doesn’t seem to be much of a hoke because I feel like she would leave me for another woman if she had the chance and the fact that my cousin (female) is currently going through a divorce/separation and they are super close I feel like that’s something that could be causing  the feelings I’ve had lately with all of her remarks. I was raised in a Christian household and always thought divorce was a big no no but now after vaguely talking with my parents I feel like if I’m not happy and my wife isn’t happy that divorce could be the answer but I don’t know where to go from there. I spent today helping said cousin move here husband into his own apartment so he has a place once the divorce is final and then went to a prom night at a bar with my aunt and uncle and it has been so nice. I’m really struggling and would let mind talking to a therapist but idk if I could afford that or even better help but I’m dreading Monday when my wife flys back home….

I'm ruining my relationship with my insecurities/ poor mental health,4,0.84,"How can I become less insecure in my relationship/ in general? I love my boyfriend more than he possibly knows. We have been together 2 years and it has basically been a perfect relationship. My relationship before this lasted three years and went very poorly. He constantly compared me to other women, hit on them in front of me, sexually abused me, the works. But this isn't the only reason I am an insecure person. I ended up in that relationship because I was insecure in the first place. I have always felt out of place, ugly, and lesser than others. It becomes a chronic feeling that gets worse day by day until all I can think about is how I will be betrayed or replaced next. 

For once in my life I was actually pretty secure at the start of my relationship, but the more I fall for my boyfriend the worse it gets. For example, he has a girl living with him and his family right now. As you can imagine, for an insecure girlfriend, this would be a deal breaker. But she moved in two months ago because she has nowhere else to go and it doesn't seem like she is going anywhere anytime soon. I have started countless arguments over this, cried, had anxiety attacks... All because I feel like this girl is going to replace me. This is just an example of my  insecure behavior. I think I'm starting to be unintentionally mentally abusive from the way I've been acting about my insecurities, and I don't know what to do.

Need advice/help. Feeling like a burden.,2,1.0,"Hi all, I am a 24 year-old male and I'm needing some honest advice.

I live in Southern California with my parents and my younger sister. Cost of living out here is insanely high, so getting my own place has proven to be very difficult. I work a full time job in the video game industry, but am not bringing in enough money to be able to afford living on my own.

I've always had a bit of a tough relationship with my family. We go through periods of everything being okay, and then there are periods where I am convinced I'm the absolute worst son/brother on the face of the planet. I get very mouthy when I don't feel heard, or when I feel like I'm being gaslit. When I am in this ""mode"", I typically say things that I later regret as they are incredibly mean. I've described it to my therapist and others as me ""going for the throat"" in a verbal sense. I can also be pretty manipulative with my words at times and it isn't something I really try to do intentionally. I'm not really thinking and planning, I just kind of talk. It's tough to explain. Earlier this week, I had a conversation with my mom and told her that I was fully aware that I had been unintentionally fucking up my relationship with them for a long time, which brings me to my main point.

I want to have a good relationship with my family. I have many friends who consider their parents their best friends, they talk about their problems, they feel safe confiding in eachother about things. I have never had that and I blame myself for it on a regular basis, even though my parents have said some fucked things to me in the past (one example; when my depression was at its worst and I was seeking help, my mom told me to just change it because it was a ""mood choice"").

I feel that even when I'm trying my hardest, I still manage to fuck up and cause issues. I don't know how to change this. It's becoming increasingly difficult to allow myself to live here.

Feeling Pathetic ,1,0.99,"
TW 

Is it pathetic? To feel so defeated at my age. I am almost 22, but I’m so tired. I ended my closest friendships and feel like I have nothing left. I deal with clinical depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, and have symptoms of Bipolar Disorder. Not a great combination. I know its normal to not know what you want to do in life, but the pressures from society makes it all so agonizing. Pressure from family…. During recent years I dropped out of college and returned later to get at least my Associates degree. I go part time and then work as much as possible. I have a relationship with my partner that has continuous issues popping up all lot. I honestly don’t think I can see myself live past the age of 25 or 30. I don’t even know if I want to get there. I’ve been trying to get better, with exercise and new hobbies but I can’t help but feel like its all for nothing.

I do have dreams, but I feel unmotivated to get to them because I feel like it’s impossible.

I feel so lost. I’m a grown adult and I already can’t handle life as it is. My mind tells me I’m not going to survive if things don’t change. What if I don’t want it to. What if it doesn’t happen. I need to act like an adult. Be responsible. Pay my taxes. Eat. Sleep. Work. Repeat. Till I’m all dried up and six feet under. I don’t want that. It terrifies me. I’m an adult. Not a child. But I feel lost and scared like one. I’m dramatic and keep my emotions in check even with help from a therapist and psychiatrist and all medicated up. I’ve taken so many kinds of pills I don’t even remember them all. 

I have a severe phobia of being alone and people abandoning me. And already it feels like so many are leaving me. Not to mention that my parents are pretty, well, older. What if something happens to them? 

I’m terrified. I don’t know how much more I can take…Ive been to the hospital and they made me feel so much worse. I feel like sleeping all the time. I want to be away from reality.

"I believe in care, but not love.",3,1.0,"During my life I’ve had that feeling of “love” towards things, but usually ended with a feeling of disappointment. I isolate myself a lot and cut people out of my life. People who say they care and love me.
I’ve been betrayed a lot, manipulated a lot, replaced a lot, and the worst is my emotions being invalidated.
I worked somewhere for 7+ years and cut all of them out. We were closer outside of work as well as in work. I had a little mental breakdown and realized they never cared.

 A year later I saw one of them in public and they came up to me and said 
[kevin] “Hey man give you been? Where’d you go?”
Me: “I just left, I decided I needed to work on myself”
Kevin: “they all miss you, we talk about you all the time. You kinda vanished”
Me: “what kind of talking about me? Good things or bad things?”
Kevin: “all good things, we tried reaching out but we got nothing back”
Me: “ohh I change my number a while ago, but it’s nice seeing you”
I didn’t and don’t believe they care at all. It took me a while to realize there wasn’t a form of care or love with them.

Even with family. I believe my family cares about me very deeply, but not love me. It doesn’t make sense to me. They say they do, they are great people. I don’t think love is a real emotion and I told them that.

I cut off five people the other day. I have booby trap’s outside of my mental wall and one of them triggered it. I saw one of them today. They said they were worried about me and was asking how I was doing. I just said to them I’ve been alright and just needed some space. Before I said it she said she cared about me. I explained to her that I have people in my life that care about me and say they love me, but it’s difficult for me to build that emotion so I kinda just cut people out of my life when someone tries to get close, and it gets worse as the years go on.

I feel extremely uncomfortable with that lie I was told. I feel like when someone gets close to me they just want to use me to their advantage.

Depressed Over My Upcoming Birthday,2,1.0,"This is my first post here, and I was really hoping I would never have to make a post of my own here, but I feel so alone. 

I was diagnosed with MDD 2 years ago when I was 17. It’s been so rough, and, at the time, I would lurk at the posts on this sub here. Sometimes they would make me feel better, and other times I would just feel validated. 

Since then, I can confidently say that I have experienced genuine happiness and felt what you could call ‘carefree’. I am genuinely shocked that I was able to overcome my major bouts of depression that I experienced just a year ago. At that time, I felt so comfortable in my depressive state, that I often felt like I didn’t want to be cured, because if I was “cured”, it would feel like my happiness is fake. I always felt as though my depression was rational, which, sure, I suppose it was.

But since feeling happy, I’ve realized that it’s possible to have a good life while still dealing with the inevitable (death and aging and pain). Even if I was happy and delusional, I can now say that I would take that over being depressed and a realist.

I know that I feel this way, because I remembered a couple days ago that my birthday is coming up. This is all because I went to the dentist, and I remembered the times where I would get to pick out a sticker at the end of my appointment, and I started feeling sick knowing that those days are over, and will never happen again, and one day I will surpass the age of my dentist, and I fear I will become unrecognizable to myself. And honestly, I already kind of do.

I left the dentist and went home and just cried and cried. It’s like a switch was flipped. The day before, I was just fine, genuinely happy. Now, going on 2 days, I’ve been crying myself to sleep, feeling sick at the thought of eating, thinking about getting older, my parents dying, being alone.

I feel like I died when I was 10, and my life now is the hell I ended up in.

I just feel like society cares less about you the older you get. I miss being viewed as innocent, even though I would never kill a fly, even as an adult. I miss not being sexualized/being defended by society over being sexualized. And I miss those damn Dora the Explorer stickers at the dentist’s office.

I think of cops, judges, prosecutors and pretty much anybody that acts tough and deals out cruelty. And I want them.

I feel like my life is falling apart and there's nothing I can do about it,1,1.0,"I (16m) don't know what to do anymore. 

I'm currently ill and the doctors haven't found out what it is yet so I have no medication I can take. It causes extreme mental fatigue which lead to me having to drop out of college despite being a straight A student.

This illness feels as if it has just crumbled my life. I cannot go outside for walks or see my friends due to being so tired 24/7.

One day I bunked off work and spent 4 hours on busses going around my city feeling like it was the end of the my life.

Whenever I see references to an individuals height I always feel numb, embarrassed, and ashamed. I’m afraid of watching dating shows, scared of looking at a girls full tinder bio, and fear the future that I’ll never have a growth spurt like everyone else did.

He is gone.

I went to a church gathering and yesterday for a few hours and now I feel like I'm going insane.

Lights turn off whenever I think of what the prophet said, my body paralyzed sometimes whenever I lay down, my dreams even.
Only thing that makes that stop is if I pray.

I have no desire to eat or drink, nor even shower or take of my teeth.
The only thing I feel is the aching of my body and how food doesn't really taste good anymore.
I turn off my phone and avoid social media because his face is everywhere.
I don't enjoy music anymore.
I still read my comics but not really interested in that either.
I wake up hot and sweaty even with the ac and fans on.

What the hell is wrong with me?

I don't understand. I feel nothing anymore. Don't really think much either.

I want to die and see him again, but at the same time I am reminded of the future.

I have this weird feeling all the time. I have a feeling that I’m making my whole life up. Like I know all this is real, but I still have this weird irrational fear that I’ll someday just ”come back to reality”

The feeling just comes suddenly at random times. When I’m home, with my friends, riding my bike etc. The thought of it comes in my head and I feel like I can’t get rid of it.
I can describe the feeling a bit . I’m aware that I’m awake and alive, but I still fear that I’m making my whole life up. For example my friends, my boyfriend or my job. Like normal things I know are real but I still fear that they ”will suddenly just disappear”.  

I’ve had this feeling on and off for few years now. I’ve had couple anxiety attacks because of this feeling. Once I asked to hug my friend just so I know she’s really there.

(I also suffer from misophonia but I don’t think it  has anything to do with this.)

Some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder? ,1,1.0,"I’m sure I should probably go to therapy and/or be medicated but I can’t afford therapy right now so I’m just dealing with things on my own. I also (maybe weirdly or naively) feel like I shouldn’t need medication because I feel like I can identify/figure out what my problems are so I should be able to figure out how to fix them too. 

Over the past few months/last year I’ve noticed that I’ve become very obsessive about a lot of things. The way I look, how I act, the things I say around friends. It’s gotten to the point where I pretty much have a constant inner monologue about whether or not I should do/act/say/wear something. And I literally mean constantly. I’ve thought back to when I was in high school and I don’t remember being like this. I feel like it’s only gotten this bad in the past year or so. 

Things I obsess over or do obsessively:
-What I wear/how I look in my clothes/what my body looks like in general 
-What I should say in certain conversations/if I say the wrong thing 
-whether or not I’m saying enough/interacting enough when hanging out with friends 
-picking at pimples/spots on my face/back/arms 

I’m not really sure how to handle this or what I can do to improve it. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Need advice on how to deal with Mom's behavior ,1,1.0,"I posted this in another subreddit as well since I figured the more advice the better.
I'm not sure if this is the right one either, but I couldn't think of anywhere else to post.  I'm f21 and my mom is f53.  Slight trigger warning for mentions of SA, stalking, and harassment. They aren't the main focal point and I'm gonna go into detail about them, but they are mentioned.
I work as a barista at a very nice curio hotel, so as expected I do get hit on quite often by guests that are staying for business or vacations or other reasons.  I usually wear a fake engagement ring to deter them, but sometimes all it does is tempt them more, and several times I've had married men try to pull the ""I won't tell if you won't tell"" card.  I complained to my mom about this tonight just jokingly, but she spun it around and accused me of lying because she's ""been in the business long enough"" (she hasn't worked as a waitress or barista in over 30 years) and said that doesn't happen.
I got incredibly irritated by that, and walked off, but I realized she does this every time I come to her.  When I was getting stalked in highschool she asked if I may have done something to lead the guy on, even after he sent me death threats and tried kidnapping me.  Then while I was in college in the fall I was being harassed by two guys I thought were my friends, who almost ended up spreading private pictures of me, and when I told her about it she tried downplaying it and said I shouldn't have been taking pictures like that anyway.  She also accused me of following a trend when I came out as bi, even though her uncle is as well, and said the same thing after I brought up potentially being autistic even though I had done months of research and our entire family on both sides has a history of being mentally ill and neurodivergent.  However anytime she notices these things on her own, she seems very eager to help and very accepting.  It's only when I mention them does she claim I'm overreacting for attention.  
Does anyone know if there's a term for this?  And/or know how to cope?

I am scared to walk in public ,1,1.0,"So i am not sure what this means how ever since I was a kid I have always over thought my walk when I am out....

So I am terrified to be seen I hate people seeing me because I feel like I am always being judge I understand why I am this way I just don't understand how to fix it ...

As a kid I would always take the bad on more than I would the good as it always seemed so bad my upbringing was a mess ...I was always in fight or flight and always had bad things happen negatively was my life .... Anyways enough of that get to the point ☝️ 

When I am out in public I hate to be seen I can't stand crossing roads I can't run for the bus I will stand and pretend I am on the phone if I have to cross the road if there is even just one car coming towards where I am going to cross the road has to be fully clear in order for me to cross if I cross while there is a car I freak out and start to panic I will the feed onto my self all the things I was doing wrong ... I didn't get over quick enough for them or I waved funny or I walked weird once getting away from the road why didn't I just wait till there was no cars ..... Like the dredd is disgusting and i have a child who obviously don't have the fears I have and I am so worried my fears of being judged at every living moment will rub off on him he has additional needs and already has mental health issues due to his additional needs .... How ever he has zero fear in him unless it's me I fears for my safety .... And I was the same as a child I always feared for my parents safety but I had a reason to fear for there safety due to there horrible life they lived and still live 30 years on .... They aren't in our lives for that reason yet my child still fears for me .... We both have ADHD as well so maybe it's just that ...but the over thinking my walk part makes zero sense to me I start over thinking then start walking funny because I am over thinking but now I also have a disability that causes me to walk weird on days and honestly I have tried to get out more but some days the pain I have is to much so I can be in the house for weeks/ months doing school runs obviously but that's about as much as I can handle on them days .....

I cannot anymore….,1,1.0,I am seriously at my limit with a lot of my family members not taking my illnesses seriously. Not just that but being treated like shit by all sorts of people. I have AlWAYS been treated like a fucking after thought. I am always being played and toyed with. The last guy that fucked with me learned a fucking hard lesson on not screwing a well meaning person out of thier sanity. They know better now and won’t ever do bs like that to someone. Fun fact: Ex ended up toying with me while he still loved his ex. I thought that i mattered to him which I realize I don’t. Still getting blamed for things that weren’t my fault sucked. Then again I get blamed for alot of shit. It’s either people lying about stuff I did or exaggerating about things out of portion. I remember when one of my sisters friends said that a guy was lying about how they had sex with me. Another time was a girl saying that I almost killed her. I gave this girl something to eat because she was crying that she was hungry. Never told me she was allergic to anything until after that fact. Then I got blamed by the friend group for making her sick. Then having a coworker call me a thief cause apparently I stole her fucking lunch. Lady went on to harass me to a store that was close to my job. Proceeded to tell the other people who worked at the other store that I was stealing. The workers began to stare at me cause they started to believe her. This coworker was one of the Security Guards and always had it out for me. She would make my shift living hell and i hated her. She sucked at her job too cause she would racially profile people. This amount other reasons is why I don’t have people around me. Whether it be actually family or those I am acquainted to. Cause they always tend to take other people’s side other than mine. My sister who is a “Therapist” always makes it hard to talk to her. I know I am accountable for my life but she’s always dissing me. Laughing and calling me an embarrassment even though she knows I have mental issues. I am burned out cause I really have no one who understands an inkling of who I am as a person.

Anyone have similar experience/how they got through it or solved it,1,1.0,"Hey everyone,

  
So I have been struggling with my mental health since at least 6th grade and I am now 23 years old. I was able to start getting mental health help within the last 2 years but it hasn't been great or really done much.

  
I left my first CBT therapist because while I didn't find our sessions negative, I didn't feel like they were helping and so I stopped going to free up my schedule. Around that time my Primary Physician set me up with an NP that focused on mental health specifically medication but also does psychotherapy on the side. She did this because my symptoms weren't having any significant improvement from any of the 3 meds I had tried in the last year.

The beginning was fine. We started trying different meds and different therapies. Some weeks I would feel neutral. Some I would feel a little better. Some I felt like an absolute mess. None of the therapy we were doing together really felt like it did anything much and up to this point currently I have tried about 15-20 different medications none of them showing any specific improvement. Within the last two years I was diagnosed with these orders in this order depression, anxiety, adhd, pmdd, bpd, and mental burnout. Within the last few weeks I could see my NP's patience running thin and him slowly suggesting less and less each week. And this past week he tried talking to me saying he thinks my main issue is i'm mentally burnout and thats my main issue. He said I should try to lessen my schedule but that just not something I can do. I'm currently only doing the bare minimum I have to do which is unfortunately 2 jobs and school. I also felt opposed to it because I don't know if thats the only thing actually wrong with me, I feel like everything I've felt and experience in the last two years isn't valid. But at the end of the session I can't remember exactly how he worded it. But he essentially said he's at a lost and doesn't know what else to try with me. I'm currently trying one of the last meds he thought of possibly putting me on. 



I also tried a DBT group but it just hasn't worked out for me because I need more 1 on 1 help so I'm about to have a first meeting with a new therapist next week. I had also previously tried another therapist a few months back to try EMDR. We never got to officially try it. There was one session where I had a mental breakdown and she kept trying to convince me to go to inpatient (I was not threatening anything I was just really emotional). I explained to her why that wasn't an option cuz I'd get kicked out of school, I will lose my apartment, have no money, no one to help me, etc. But she wouldn't listen and just told me we're not scheduling another session and to seek inpatient.

  
So now I'm kind of at a lost. I feel like I don't know whats actually wrong with me. I have no idea how to fix myself or improve myself or just learn how to cope. I'm feeling like maybe I'm just a fraud and there isn't anything actually wrong with me and I've just been overreacting. And a huge thing contributing to this has been the fact that no medications have done me any good and none of the therapy I've tried thus far has really helped me. I don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone had a similar situation. Does anyone have any suggestions. I just need help and don't know what to do anymore.

Mental health services suck ,1,1.0,"So I'm 25 male who's struggled with addiction since I was 14 dad died from alcohol and drug abuse when I was 17. I'm 3 years sober now but this past year has been the worst ever. I live in a rural area and with the way things are in the US and the world in general money is the only thing that matters. It's harder then ever just to make ends meet and it's only getting worse. Everyone is so hateful and miserable it's hard to see anything positive in this world. Men's mental health is a joke to most people aI don't ever wanna get married or have kids. More men commit suicide over women and women using there kids as a weapon I divorce than anything so why even try. The government and news are always dividing us with racial, gender, political views whatever they can to cause more problems. Trying to find any mental health services that doesn't cost hundreds - thousands is a lost cause. Since getting sober my social anxiety and just anxiety in general has went through the roof. And now it seems popular to act like anxiety is just being dramatic and a man shouldnt have that and need to just get over it. I cant seem to get anything to go right at all. Everytime something good happens I don't even enjoy it because I know something 100x worse is about to happen and make everything good that happened pointless. So I've lost all hope for things to get better it's just another never ending cycle like addiction except now I don't have the drugs to make me feel okay for a short amount of time. The only positive thing in my life is my dog and my mom. If it wasn't for them especially my mom I would of killed myself by now. I told myself for the longest time I would kill myself by the time I was 25 no matter what. But now I can't bring myself to do it because my mom has been through so much already and I don't wanna put her through more. But I know I'm getting close to that point where I can't deal with it anymore. I don't even get out of the house much anymore and I used to be outside 24/7 and loved fishing and camping. I've got a motorcycle in my first year of sobriety but dont ride it because every time I start to enjoy it something breaks or some 1/10000 problem occurs. Same thing with my camper van I bought after someone totalled my truck I got it to travel and try and enjoy life and everytime I'm almost done and get ready to hit the road something else breaks and I spend months saving the money to fix it for the cycle to continue so now I've just given up and the bike and van are both messed up and don't have the money to fix it. At this point I don't know where to go from here and don't have the energy or care to try anymore. I don't have any positive thoughts about myself or life anymore and haven't for close to a year. I don't even know why I'm posting this as if the Internet is gonna help but I don't have any friends anymore since getting sober and my social anxiety keeps me from making any new ones so I guess this is all I have.

I feel like im going insane and my mood keeps switching so much,1,1.0,"I feel like recently I’ve only been having three moods that I switch between, either i dont have neither the energy or motivation to even stand up, just not really present/normal, or I’m bouncing off the walls hysteric. Just a bit ago I spent like 2 hours laughing and yelling random stuff while playing those youtube in app games until i was sweating. 
It feels almost a bit like I’m on crack, or at least what I imagine it would be like, my brain goes numb and just everything’s funny and I feel this need to just say stuff, anything, to make noise. 
It’s much more common for me to be tired and demotivated or normal, but especially recently I’ve been feeling this more energetic state. It seems to kinda switch every couple of hours, and its something that I could prevent if I tried but i guess Ive just been letting it happen, making me wonder if its even really new or if I’ve just been suppressing it, but i think it is new to at least this extent.
Either way for a while now I’ve been feeling like I just genuinely cant stand existing, my brain hurts and it almost feels like a branding iron on the back of my brain, it makes me wanna hit my head until it goes away. It comes and goes without really any pattern to my mood, and havent really been able to find any pattern to it at all really. 
I think my more depressive state and normal state enable it to happen more, and I almost numb my brain and use it as fuel for my frenzic moods. Its a bit tough to put into words, but something like that
I feel like im descending into insanity, and i can either choose to do it painfully and slowly (in my more depressive mood) or quickly and funly (in my hysteric mood)

I thought it would get better. ,1,1.0,"I am a single parent who was going to school full time and being in the military. I have a wonderful partner who has stepped up to the parental roll alongside me and encouraged me to go to school when I suggested it. 

Doing school and work and parenting for the last almost 2 years has been severely feeding into my depression over the last couple of months. I really thought it would get better when I got out. 

Well, I got out almost a month ago and I still have no motivation to upkeep the home or do any of my schoolwork (and I LOVE what I go to school for, and my education plan is projected to land me a well-paying job). 

My partner and I agreed on me upkeeping the home while I finished my schooling because he saw how taxing it was. He also knows about my multiple diagnoses. I’ve been in therapy for years and been on so many different medications. It just comes in waves. 

It doesn’t feel as strong as it used to, where I would be miserable at the thought of doing anything. I would still do it, because I HAVE to as a parent. I would push anything aside for my kids. I don’t want to die anymore. 

I’m just… tired and unmotivated and don’t want to get out of bed. I don’t want to shower and I don’t want to brush my teeth. Which is in turn making it worse because it’s feeding my anxiety. 

I’m just waiting for it to get better. I feel like I’m in purgatory. I know it probably won’t ever go away completely, but I figured by this point I would at least have a “honeymoon phase” to getting rid of one of my biggest stressors.

Something weird is happening to my body/mind,1,1.0,"So school just ended and I've gotten into summer leave, I will have to explain some stuff about my life atm for people to understand this because otherwise nothing will make sense

I moved out from my moms place in October thx to the social services here in Sweden and I've lived alone since then, I've gotten money from the social services to pay for food and such but they have requirements that I need to follow to get that money wich I have been following.

They recently gave me the requirement to have a job during the summer since I won't be studying for 10 weeks due to the summer leave but I'm not mentally ready for work, my doctor say I probably have one or more of PTSD, BPD, Autism or ADHD with the possibility of other diagnoses but I'm still in a queue to get tested for them all.

I've had issues with disassociation and out of body experiences aswell as moments where something triggers me and I lose control of myself and result to violence.

Due to this my doctor says I'm unfit for work atm so she put me on sick leave so that I can still get money from the social services while I take this summer to relax and get myself sorted out

(Note: my doctor is the main spokesperson for my therapist/psychologist and other members of my health team so everything they discuss gets told to me by my doctor) 

The summer leave has just started and for the last few days I've had random instances of feeling anxious and I also sleep a lot, I have always had trouble sleeping and I still have those but when I start sleeping there's nothing that will wake me up unless there's a loud sound or flashing lights that wake me up

This has resulted in me sleeping for 12+ hours every day since the 10th of June, my friend and gf have noticed this and they call me every morning around 11am-1pm to wake me up because otherwise I can sleep from 2am to 4pm wich isn't normal for me usually.

I also have gotten into some economic troubles because I play airsoft in my free time and during a match one of my friends shot my phone screen outside of the match area so I had to throw up 1900kr (almost 200USD) wich I didn't have so I am now in debt to another friend who helped me with the costs

If this incident didn't happen then I wouldn't have to worry to much about my economic situation with the bills and such I have to pay

On top of that my gf is coming by the end of the month and idk if I can afford food for both her and me for those 4 days that she is here, I also got the pressure that I need to clean my whole apartment and also cover the expenses for a BBQ party that my friends decided that I should pay for.

Rn I've pulled all the strings I can to make all this work, I've used favours and asked around everywhere to make everything work. I've even decided to survive only on rice and pasta to make the economy work out.

I wouldn't be in this situation if I had broken contact with my mom when I moved out because even after I moved out she pressured me to take stuff on credit for her so now I'm still paying bills for her Internet and her phone and I can't cancel them because of the binding time. 

If I didn't have to pay for those I'd have 1000kr extra each month wich would've made this so much easier.

accusations in psychosis? ,1,1.0,"i’m new to reddit but seriously need some sort of guidance. my younger sister moved out and has been really distance with me and my parents for over 3 years. i recently found out that all of her friends think we are an abusive family. i could go into detail, but there’s no point. we aren’t. it was so shocking to hear this because me and my sister were best friends growing up. our parents are gentle and kind and we never got ‘punished’ growing up - not even in the form of getting our phones taken away. i know she started drinking, smoking, and god knows what else ate age 16, and her friends don’t seem like the best influence. my parents tried everything they could to gently shield her, but she moved out and cut ties. now, her female best friend 
from her childhood kicked her out because of her undiagnosed and unmedicated manic behaviors. this led to a mental hospital admission against her will because she had a blow up and was deemed a danger to herself and others. she was diagnosed with bipolar and was confirmed to be in psychosis and was put on antipsychotics. she’s back at living with us, and she thinks her friends plotted against her to “cause her downfall”. She’s been out for four weeks but it seems like her meds aren’t even working. she has been telling her friends that my father physically abuses her, and she now is trying to turn me against my father by telling me the horrible things he does to her. the sad thing is, i know they simply aren’t true. it’s hard to sit there and take it without defending him, but she just has rage behind her eyes if i don’t acknowledge that she’s right. what the f*ck do i do… 

some context, im fully for believing the victim, so this kills me to say… but i know the truth because i am with her all the time and my dad works from home and they are LITERALLY never alone. he is also and has always been the MOST gentle and kind father. but the police have been called on him for “domestic abuse” recently and of course nothing came of it, but it’s really starting to destroy our family. he still loves her and is letting her stay at our house, but it is killing my mother and me. She’s been checked for any hard drugs and her results have always come back clean. it seems to be all entirely mental. i cannot stress enough that we had the best childhood and we were always … ALWAYS… together.

The mental situation I'm experiencing ,1,1.0,"Hi! :•) (sorry for my english, it's not my first language.)
Ever since I was a child, I always struggled a lot with ocd/adhd/eating disorders and as I grew up I started to struggle with depression/anxiety as well. I'm 23 now, I came out as queer when I was 15, and as non-binary when I was 17.
I went to therapy-like things in 3 time periods, once when I was about 7(?) because of my ocd, I went to high school therapy because of my eds, and I went to a licensed therapist when I was 19 due to being passive suicidal. The first therapy wasn't real therapy (my mom is very spiritual, and it was something to do with that), my second therapist told me to try to lose more weight, because ""I will get happier if I get skinny"" (I told her my struggles before that, and I was pretty much medium sized), and my third therapist tried to cure me from being gay instead of helping with my depression. I still want to try therapy for a 4th time, but I can't afford it atm.
The reason is that even tho I'm very much happy (having a career I love, a loving partner, and a lovely baby cat💖) I still feel the same way I felt when I was a teenager.
I feel like as everyone else has a personality, a style, an aura around them, meanwhile I feel blank. I experience empathy/I can easily communicate with others, yet I feel like something is missing. I feel less human, my mind is so disconnected from my body, it's really hard to accept/realise that they're connected. I don't experience feeling like a woman or anything else really, I feel like a tiny robot controling my temporary human body, I dont understand what am I supposed to feel about my body/gender/personality, but I hardly recognise it. I thought if I was trans or autistic, but I don't feel much body gender disphoria, except about the thought of others percieving me, but I wonder if it's because my lack of connection to my body. And I also dont think I'm autistic as I have an easy time decoding other people (I have other autistic tendencies, but it might be just my adhd). I just struggle with understanding myself, everything about my style, self expression etc. feels like a performance. What I aspire to look like depends on the cool people I saw the last time. I still never feel like I look like myself.
Does anyone else experiences this feeling, is there a word for this? Can this be helped? Is there any coping mechanism? Maybe topics I could research?

Ultradian cycling,1,1.0,"Ever since my young teen years, I have had episodes where I felt really miserable about things in life—things that wouldn't normally bother me. These episodes would happen consistently, but recently it's different. They have become more frequent, more intense, and really spontaneous in the sense that there is no reason I can think of for them to happen.

An example is, let's say I'm on a night out with friends. It can come just like that. I got a bus to the shops to buy some white bread to have some beans on toast. I was listening to happy, upbeat music, and then, at the drop of a hat, I felt like everything in life is pointless. I thought, ""Why am I even alive? What am I even doing? Everything is pointless. Why even eat?"" I tried playing happy music, but I felt so empty I couldn't rationalize my existence or why I would be happy to be alive tomorrow. I ended up not buying anything, and within an hour, I felt normal but really irritable. No one has ever really seen me angry before, and I felt like I was on the verge of shouting at someone. Maybe an hour later, I felt normal again.

Today, I was bowling with friends, and I felt the feeling of emptiness for no reason out of nowhere. I kept looking up so tears wouldn't roll out of my eyes. These are examples of these depressive episodes, but the thing is, they don't last long. It's more like a day where I feel empty, then fine, then empty again.

I'll mention that two days prior to this, I felt like life was good. I almost felt like I was 10 again. But I have more of these depressive episodes, and it's only recently that I even have these elevated moods. I've had mood swings, but this is nothing like that. Normal mood swings wouldn't really affect the way I behave, like stopping me from buying bread even though I took a bus all the way to the shops. However, these episodes are not long, ranging from 30 minutes to 4 hours, sometimes scattered across a day.

Im scared of making the wrong decision and possibly ruining my life,1,1.0,"Hi I am a 20F from the Midwest. I have struggled with my mental health for a long time. I was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and anxiety. I am scared of making the wrong decision and messing up my life. To me, making the wrong decision feels life-ending.

Within the past 4 years, my life has gone to hell. I tried to ignore my issues and pretended like everything was fine. In the fall of 2022 I moved out of my parents house for the first time and tried my luck at a 4-year college. I was asked to leave after 1 semester. I had a 1.03gpa and a severe drinking problem. I moved back to my parents house and in the fall of 2023 I then attempted community college. To deal with moving back into my parents house I started working 2 part-time jobs while in school. I couldn't stand being at home or being by myself. I started taking pills to feel better and almost deleted myself of the planet around new years of 2024.

In January of 2024, my parents told me I had to go into treatment or get kicked out of their house. I reluctantly went into treatment and it has been the best decision ever. In February of 2024 I went to a rehab in SoCal. I am now living at a sober living in SoCal. In a couple of months I will be graduating from this program and will have to figure out my next steps in life.

Part of me wants to move back to the Midwest into my late grandparents house so I can be around my family. The only community I have there is family. I feel like that is the safest option but I would lose the sober community I have made here in SoCal. I also feel like I would lose who I am and once winter hits I would spiral back down. None of my family is sober so it would be difficult being around them knowing they don't care to take away those triggers. I would feel guilty not moving back because I do have younger siblings. I am use to being a parent to them and it is difficult not being there physically for them. In this situation I wouldn't have to worry about housing.

The other part of me wants to stay in SoCal. I have found myself and a community that I can genuinely be myself. I recently started dating this guy in the military and he is stationed out here (I am not making this decision based on him but it is a nice bonus). I have made life long friends who I can count on. It doesn't snow, and I am close to the ocean. In this situation I would have to get a job, worry about a car, and possibly school. I would get my own apartment or rent a room. I love this option but I also feel guilty choosing myself over my family.

I just want to know others thoughts on this and what others would do in this situation.",mentalhealth,PenLow5573,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dgu9ac/im_scared_of_making_the_wrong_decision_and/,2,1.0,0.0,2.13185979184521e-06,"['hi', 'midwest', 'struggled', 'mental', 'health', 'long', 'time', 'recently', 'diagnosed', 'bpd', 'ptsd', 'anxiety', 'scared', 'making', 'wrong', 'decision', 'messing', 'life', 'making', 'wrong', 'decision', 'feel', 'within', 'past', 'year', 'life', 'gone', 'hell', 'tried', 'ignore', 'issue', 'pretended', 'like', 'everything', 'fine', 'fall', 'moved', 'parent', 'house', 'first', 'time', 'tried', 'luck', 'college', 'asked', 'leave', 'semester', 'severe', 'drinking', 'problem', 'moved', 'back', 'parent', 'house', 'fall', 'attempted', 'community', 'college', 'deal', 'moving', 'back', 'parent', 'house', 'started', 'working', 'job', 'school', 'could', 'stand', 'home', 'started', 'taking', 'pill', 'feel', 'better', 'almost', 'deleted', 'planet', 'around', 'new', 'year', 'january', 'parent', 'told', 'go', 'treatment', 'get', 'kicked', 'house', 'reluctantly', 'went', 'treatment', 'best', 'decision', 'ever', 'february', 'went', 'rehab', 'socal', 'living', 'sober', 'living', 'socal', 'couple', 'month', 'graduating', 'program', 'figure', 'next', 'step', 'life', 'part', 'want', 'move', 'back', 'midwest', 'late', 'grandparent', 'house', 'around', 'family', 'community', 'family', 'feel', 'like', 'safest', 'option', 'would', 'lose', 'sober', 'community', 'made', 'socal', 'also', 'feel', 'like', 'would', 'lose', 'winter', 'hit', 'would', 'spiral', 'back', 'none', 'family', 'sober', 'would', 'difficult', 'around', 'knowing', 'care', 'take', 'away', 'trigger', 'would', 'feel', 'guilty', 'moving', 'back', 'younger', 'sibling', 'use', 'parent', 'difficult', 'physically', 'situation', 'would', 'worry', 'housing', 'part', 'want', 'stay', 'socal', 'found', 'community', 'genuinely', 'recently', 'started', 'dating', 'guy', 'military', 'stationed', 'making', 'decision', 'based', 'nice', 'bonus', 'made', 'life', 'long', 'friend', 'count', 'snow', 'close', 'ocean', 'situation', 'would', 'get', 'job', 'worry', 'car', 'possibly', 'school', 'would', 'get', 'apartment', 'rent', 'room', 'love', 'option', 'also', 'feel', 'guilty', 'choosing', 'family', 'want', 'know', 'others', 'thought', 'others', 'would', 'situation']","{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': -0.4895}",negative
My depressed friend is acting strange and it is concerning,1,1.0,"A close friend of mine has been a depressed a while maybe 2 years. In terms of how its affected our relationship they have been somewhat distant sometimes, not responding to messages all the time, not being talkative and not being themselves at all. I have tried my best to be there for them, offering advice where I can as I've been in a deep depression before as well. Its really starting to affect me being around them as their constant low mood is somewhat contagious to me. 

In social situations they tend to cope drink alot, not speak any sense whatsoever, like compete nonsense 90% of the time. Its like they don't have any rational actions, wanting to impulsively do weird things and saying complete nonsense sentences. They also sometimes say things in a somewhat joking tone that are really serious, like ""I should cut myself"" or things along those lines. They have a history of self harm so its really concerning them saying these things around me and others. 
I am really confused by their behavior and wondering how I can manage its impact on my own mental health will still helping them and supporting them. Also worth mentioning they are on Sertraline and have been for a few weeks and receiving a form of online therapy.

She never let us clean because we couldn’t do it right and she had extreme reactions and self loathing if we touched anything.

I’m afraid there’s no treatment, my therapist has said there are no medications that will help, and that my only hope is exposure therapy/just talking about it, which hasn’t helped for over 5 years now.

I feel responsible for how bad my life went since my teenage years,1,1.0,"It's an awful feeling. I feel it all started when I was 14-15. I needed to start to work hard at school and I never got to it. It all went downhill from here. I'm 29 now and I'm struggling so hard at work. This affects everything. I can't do it. Anytime I need to use my brain and be creative, or solve problems, I'm flooded with intrusive thoughts, always losing my concentration. It has got so bad, now it happens even in my daily life, like when I'm watching movies, or in a conversation, anytime I'm encountering something new and challenging, my brain switches off.

  
I guess it would be nice to grow as a person. When I try and make up my mind about it, I come to the conclusion I'm the #1 responsible person for how badly my life turned out, and I feel so hopeless about it. No one around me inspires me to become better. My parents lived average lives and I feel they gave up early on their dreams. I don't want to do that. I think I would rather die.

"Feeling stuck at 35: Struggling with regret, addiction, and AI dependency",2,1.0,"Hey everyone,

I'm 35 years old and I've been fantasizing about going back in time to a specific point in my life. I wish I could redo everything while keeping the knowledge I've gained up to now. There are so many things I would do differently, starting with my behaviors and habits.

I barely play computer games anymore, but I spent so much time on them in the past. Even now, I'm constantly thinking about games, buying stuff, and new games to play, only to get bored or frustrated with life. Then I don't go back to them, and I have games on Steam, wheels, and pedals I don't use. I missed out on experiences and better opportunities because of it. And I think that if I could go back, I'd use that time differently. I'd dedicate myself to learning my musical instrument, something I love but never gave enough time to. Now, even though I do play an instrument, I feel stuck and can't seem to evolve. I see others starting out and progressing quickly, but I can't get past my limitations because I always give up quickly. I really want to do it, but it's like my body doesn't respond. I can't get the instrument and practice the same amount of hours I dedicate to games and anime. I feel like I don't have the physical strength to get moving.

Another major issue is porn. I think I've become addicted to the point where almost nothing satisfies me anymore. It's not just about porn; I struggle to find pleasure in anything. Even when I watch porn, I have trouble finding something that truly gives me pleasure. Is this a thing others experience too? What can I do to free myself from this?

I'm also heavily dependent on artificial intelligence. I love writing and to create websites, but even at work, where I need to write scripts, news, and speeches, I rely on AI for everything. The thing is, some people understand my website posts are generated by AI and are abandoning my websites, not following them anymore because of that. I get mad, but I understand it. I wouldn't read something a machine wrote either.

I've tried to commit suicide a few times, the last of which left me on life support and needing a lot of rehabilitation. I keep thinking that if I'm not realizing my will – doing exercise, practicing my musical instrument, writing from my own mind without AI, living without the unrealism of porn – then it's not worth it.

I need help. I want to change, but I feel stuck. Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated.

What happened to me?,1,0.66,"Is there something wrong with me?

I don't get excited. I'm not excitable. Really. I get told that something is happening, and I don't dread it or worry either. I'm just there. 

I don't smile. I don't frown or scowl either. People say I look upset. I'm not upset. I'm also not the smiley type.


I don't like seeing family. When I do I just feel like I'm holding my breath. It's at the point where my mom would rather I not come to events. I don't cause trouble, but would also rather not be there. 

I don't like seeing friends or the people who are supposed to be friends by extension of my wife. I saw some the other weekend and couldn't stop thinking about everything I was falling behind at home. Then this week her new job has some mandatory fun next weekend, and I'm still exhausted from seeing people last month. I said no thanks. She said she would take our daughter to the event without me. I said please do.

My work had a luncheon, ie, mandatory fun. I'm a  teacher, and it was the last event before summer. We had to come in just for this mandatory fun, and all I want is to be out of there. The whole time I wondered how and when I could get out. I thought maybe if I fall and jerk my head, the mandatory nonsense would be over
a teacher and it was the last event before summer.  

I don't think I'm depressed.

I used to work out a ton, but then I tore my Achilles a second time. It's been a rough recovery. 

I used to play video games as a me time. Then my wife got pregnant and we had to move to a new house. Then we had a daughter. I love my daughter, but I haven't played video games since when I moved.

There's constant work to do in this house, and if I let the grass grow too much, it'll be more of a pain to mow. Two weekends in a row it rained, and when I finally mowed it was way too long. I also killed a baby bird by accident since I couldn't see it in the high grass. I don't want that to happen again.

My HVAC unit went out in March.. Replacing it was 30g. I know. A few weeks later, my wife's junker car required 2k to fix, and it seemed more reasonable to finally get a car that would help the baby. Suddenly two more payments a month. 
Then two weeks later she got a good review on Tuesday and was fired Friday. 

It took two months for her to get a new job. In the meantime I was picking up all kinds of side gigs and tutoring hours. 
I was working 6-7 days a week.

I don't like holidays. It's just more work. I'd rather to work than the the extra work from home.

I obviously can't kill myself because then I'll get sent to Hell, so my only choice is to endure this crappy life I was given for at least 50 more years (I'm 23 now). The love of my life just recently left me, we had plans to get married and now I know I'll never meet anyone like her again. I have no family. The only family I have left, my mother and brother, are toxic people who hate my Catholic faith so I prefer not to associate with them. I don't have any friends aside from people I play video games with on Discord, but those aren't really meaningful relationships.

Blank mind 24/7,2,1.0,"Hello,

I have to vent this otherwise I may do something stupid. 

I have a blank mind 24/7. It's not even funny anymore. I always thought it gets better some day but here I am starring a wall having not a single thought in my head. People say oh I want that, it must by peaceful. F\*ck no it is the opposit. I have to do tasks for university but its impossible. I can't even read a senetence and comprehend the meaning of it. I'm so f\*cking done with this bs. If your brain does't work what's the point? I feel like a animal. For real, I recently watched a video about ravens solving problems and I was like my IQ must be below a raven at least. How can you be this f\*ck empty  in your f\*cking brain? I tried to force myself to have at least one thought but when I do that my forhead starts to hurt and the train of thought is lost at an instant.

You might say how do you write this text without thinking? But I can tell you it feels like my fingers are moving on their own and my thoughts are in such a distance that I cant recognize them. 

I always thought it gets better. I always treated my body very well. I never drik alcohol, no drugs, best of natural food, no sogar, only water, sleep 8h a day. I take care of my body because I know its the vehicle of my mental ability. Yet im here with a completely nonfunctional mind. It's frustrating to the point where I ask myself: Why should I even care if it doesn't make any difference anyways??? I see pople smoking, drinking, doing drugs and eating trash and they are highly functional. Like what am I doing wrong. How is this fair? If things don't get better soon I don't know how long I can treat my body as a temple.

YOU MATTER. Never forget that. ,1,1.0,"To anybody struggling

If you ever feel like hurting yourself or anything, reach out. You will regret not doing so, you will. So if you are struggling or you know someone who is, reach out or encourage them to

If you are not doing okay, remember that is okay. It is okay to not feel okay, to not feel normal, to not feel happy, it's okay. But it isn't okay to not reach out, to not ask for help. 

If you need to reach out but you're scared, ask someone to do it for you, or write it down or put it in your notes app and send it to someone. I can guarantee that they will be there if you need them.

If you ever need help with your mental health, never be afraid to reach out to someone who cares about you. Please don't ever forget that you are worth it, you deserve to live, you deserve to stay here, you are worth it. 

Please don't ever be afraid to reach out to someone. If someone reaches out to you, don't ignore them, help them out. They need you. 

If you are reaching out, then i am proud of you. I am, because I know what it's like to be scared to reach out. I know what it's like to be afraid of judgement and to not get the help you need. 

Always find a way to reach out. Always find a way to seek help. Find a way to help yourself the way you need it.

You are worth it, you are worth the effort, you are worth the time, you are worth it. Don't ever forget that, don't ever lose hope. 

Don't let your parents, sisters, brothers, grandparents, aunts, uncles, whoever you have in your life, burry you.

Think about the future you have ahead of you, not the past that's behind you, focus on what you want for yourself, not what happened.

Believe that you can get through it, that you can get past this struggle because you can. You are strong, you are brave, you are worth everything. You matter. Never forget that.

Advagen Pharma Clonazepam experience,0,0.5,"I'm writing this out of sheer desperation because the situation with Advagen Pharma's generic clonazepam is driving me nuts. I just need to speak out. I've been taking clonazepam since 2019. Last year, I started the tapering process, beginning with 1 mg. For some reason, I haven't been able to get the TEVA brand for a while and was given Solco instead. The shock I experienced after getting the blue sugar pills produced by this company was unimaginable. I thought I was doing something wrong (like tapering too quickly), but NO! It took me **two months** to realize there was a problem with the manufacturer.

I did some research, and here are the results: pharmacies can't order preferred brands for controlled medicine—the DEA does that job. I contacted Advagen with a complaint in the most frustrated manner, to which they replied that they would send it to their quality control team (which basically means nothing). I reported this company to the DEA and FDA. I also wrote a negative review on Google.

Most of the pharmacies in my area have Advagen, so I have to call each one until I find one with TEVA. The problem with all of this is that my dosage increased since I was on Advagen for two months.

family rant,1,1.0,"I need to vent about a really frustrating situation with my family. So, I have this aunt, who’s technically both my maternal and paternal aunt (Indian family dynamics, right?). Anyway, her husband passed away, and since then, she and her kids, Aryan and Rohan, have been pretty distant from the rest of the family. My parents and she don’t talk anymore due to some old issues I don’t want to get into.

What’s really getting to me is how her younger son, Rohan, treats my dad. My dad used to be super close to Rohan, but now Rohan walks past him without even saying hi. It breaks my dad’s heart, and seeing him hurt just tears me up inside.

Today, I decided to ask my aunt why this is happening. She basically told me she can’t control what Rohan thinks or does, and then she started airing out her own grievances with my dad. It was so uncomfortable. I get that adults have their issues, but why drag the kids into it? As a mother, shouldn’t she encourage her kids to at least be polite and respectful, regardless of the adult drama?

I mean, I don’t even like my cousins’ grandfather, but I still talk to him nicely because I know my cousins love him.

This is to the degree where I have literally not gone to funerals or cursed them on their death bed because they wronged me in some menial way.

My older cousin who I was close to as a kid died of cancer in 2015. Around 2008 he disagreed with me over a small thing (he wanted to get food somewhere and I wanted to go to another place). I held that grudge forever. I didn't talk to him again until he was on his death bed. He called me over the phone (or rather my family forced me to answer) and he was sad we never reconnected. I laughed at him for having cancer, dying, reality being meaningless, no one will miss him, etc. then hung up and that was that. Didn't go to his funeral and messed up his grave.

 My body has to be reconstructed with some implants and took over a year to recover but i still have neuropathic pain and paralysis every day. I have been in therapy since before then and continually after.

 Yet. I feel like the biggest failure and it feels like I can’t get anything right. My disability ran out. My debt levels are massive. And I’m broke. I have been rejected from job interviews 10 times in the last two weeks after reaching second rounds.

And sometimes I feel utterly useless and go I fought and survived dying twice on that operating table for what? I don’t know what I want by posting here. I just feel sadness guilt and shame I suppose. And frustration.

 I don’t know what fixes this. Especially when people close to me keep reminding me how good I was before and that I can be that again. And I feel so guilty for feeling like a burden to those around me with my chaos.

I feel let down by my GP and other mental health support (UK) and not sure where to go to get answers.

For context I (28f) have had complex mental health since I was a young teenager. Marked by “anti-self thoughts” and periods of extreme lows. I don’t think in my adult life (21yo+) I have felt happiness the way most people do even while attaining stability and personal success.

My GPs are underfunded and very very resistant to labelling or providing more support other than providing me with generalised anti depressants. Recently I was told by a gp “there isn’t much else we can offer you”. 

I know my best route is private assessment but when I look at assessments on psychiatry website they only mention adhd/autism. Not to rule myself out form that but having friends/family/partner on the spectrum. It doesn’t feel the right route.

Feeling shame and loneliness because I suffer from mental illnesses,3,1.0,"I’m a 22 year old female, almost 23. I’m not from the States, but from Eastern Europe. The reason I think this is worth mentioning is that mental health is something of “new age” around here, it’s been getting recognized as something a lot of people struggle with just in the last 5 years of so, and even that in the big cities. And not even there 100%. 
My ‘thing’ is adhd, mild depression and mild to high anxiety, depending a lot on the context I guess. But yeah, everyday I wake up and dread waking up, start having anxiety about all the things I should do, what do I want to do, etc… it’s just very confusing and I usually end up in my bed hating my life and using my boyfriend as emotional support since my social skills have downgraded so bad it feels so weird and out of place to be in society and to mentain connections. I wait for everyday to be over and honestly don’t feel that much excited about anything.
I don’t want to say I have depression or that I’m depressed because I feel like I was a lot worse a year back and I know a lot of people have it a lot worse but when I think about me in retrospective, yeah… something’s definitely not right.
That being said, last week my psychiatrist prescribed me a antidepressant. I don’t know if the moderators accept mention of pharmaceuticals but the med’s name doesn’t matter anyways. What matters is the shame I feel around not being better. The shame I feel about taking antidepressants and other meds. It’s like my thoughts are composed of “do you really need this? Could’ve just put more effort in therapy. Why don’t you sleep well, eat well, exercise? You know that may be the reason you’re not well and you just go straight to meds”.
On the other hand I try to remember what my therapist said, that we, as humans, weren’t necessarily created to be happy. And I try to cling onto that, I try to remember how many philosophers were depressed even before medicine, how a lot of them drowned their sorrows in alcohol and drugs because the life lived back then was really hard to live. And I try to remind myself of that.
But when I do, the thoughts come right back. I have a supportive family, good financial situation, I am smart, I have friends, I have options and I have my freedom - and still feel this way. It’s just like, why do I feel this way in spite of what I have?
Overall it just makes me feel ashamed and as if something is wrong with me but not that wrong in order to need meds. I just wanna feel more at peace with the meds, I want to think of them as something as like a heart problem individual  taking meds for their high blood pressure, but it’s really hard.

How do i go about quitting my job after being in the hospital?,1,0.99,"Hi there. I just got out of the psychiatric hospital this morning, after voluntarily admitting myself on Monday. I’ve come to realize that a decent bit of my stress in general comes from my job. At first, my plan was to go back in and switch to part time until I had another job lined up, as i start a DBT program later this month. The more I think about it, the more I absolutely dread returning to my current job. I know it may sound immature or impulsive, but I truly can’t go back. That job has greatly contributed to my declining mental health over the time I’ve worked there. If I return, I’m essentially asking to hit another rock bottom. After talking with my husband, he seems to be okay with me not returning as long as I can find something else soon.

i feel lost in life...what should i do?,1,1.0,"
I just want to share my experience here.
I'm only 16 years old but i don't see even see myself in the future anymore or imagine what I'm doing after 10 years. 

When i was a kid I'm known as the genius, jolly, playful, and happy daughter..i have many dreams just like being a teacher, lawyer, architect someday but things sadly change when i turned 14. I feel lost and unmotivated to live, i feel like everyone is moving forward except me. Its like I'm stuck in the same place for years, i don't have improvements and I'm slowly falling apart, i even have a hard time focusing on my studies..but yeah im still an honor student tho but not really that high compared to my old grades.

It's been 3 years but I'm still feeling heavy and sad even tho I'm trying my best to be better, it just keep getting worse. I even avoid social interactions cause i feel like im always judged from other ppl. I also don't like to eat. I only eat one meal a day, sometimes i don't even eat at all. All i do everyday is sleep do some houseold chores and sleep again cause its my way to cope my sadness. 

When i try to open up to my parents they always scold me for being lazy and doing nothing, when i told them I'm not feeling well they always find a way to blame me. also on my academic performance, they compare me to other students and that hurts so bad. Talking bad abt me. There was the time that i already have a courage to eat but what they did is they just insulted me and told me to dont eat too much cause i will gain weight. Hearing them insulting, saying harsh words to me hurts so much cause come on why do you guys keep ruining my day when i trying my best to live? i really can do it anymore

A little background..

I got Severely Depressed in like January and it lead to me almost making an attempt since then it’s been okay. I still deal with issues and I’ve been on a laundry list of pills Prozac,Zoloft,Strattera,Bupropion

None of them really worked for me until I landed on Vraylar which sucked honestly, like I couldn’t sleep or anything like that and I had this urge to do something. Like when I sat down it was a nagging feeling. I still take that because I like what it did for my mood I take that and I just started Concerta 10 days ago.


But anyways, I was doing fine actually just living life thought it was getting better and then WHAM! Out of nowhere I start dwelling on how bad my memory is due to my ADHD I think. Like I have to strain to remember things. And that makes me think “what’s the point” and I started having suicidal ideations and urges again. Instead of just thoughts. Probably propped up by Anxiety 

I just moved so I don’t have access to my psychiatrist anymore nor do I have the money to afford a visit. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m supposed to do stuff like find a job an all that but all I do all day is stay in my room and lie in bed on my phone watching YouTube.

Realised now that over the years I became stupid (both my fault and exefrnal factors). ANY advice will be appreciated as at the moment starting to panic,1,1.0,"Hello,


Sorry, not sure where to post this. 32 yo woman here, single .

I was the smart child growing up. Knew how to read in 3 languages before starting school.

First 4-5 years of school I was the best. Later on I was the best in languages but catching up on maths (languages came to me naturally without even trying. I didn't study. Maths and physics came to me after studying /diving deeper).

BUT I realised long ago that I definitely was NOT the smartest.  For a lot of subjects I had to study harder Nonetheless, I continued on ""grinding"" and taking in as much as I could. 

I always liked biology and physics and I absolutely did not want to go after a language degree. My goal was to get a STEM degree. Will admit that part of that was reputation STEM had (well, at least had back then) but another part was to understand the world better. Languages help you on how to communicate but there is no real knowledge (as much as I loved them).


When I was 16 I emigrated with my parents.
I kind of spoke English ... But had to redo a year again because the system here is different and I still could not understand a lot of what was being said. 

Later on at the age of 18 I got a factory job and that's when the real hell started.

These jobs usually require you to stay in one place for long periods of time ( normally 12 hours with 40 min break split in 2).
First I worked during summer. Once summer was over I worked during the weekends. 

I realised that my memory has deteriorated significantly. I could not memorise what was written on one page. Let alone one paragraph.

I tried hard, read a lot of books but still struggled.


I NEVER had a perfect memory. Far from it but I noticed that it got really bad... Cry in the corner bad... 

Had a friend who was studying masters and she said the same after 1 month of working that job but I'm sure she bounced from that. 

Somehow I managed to get into a uni to study science but I really struggled there. Had to retake a couple years. In the end finished with 2:1.

Fast forward to today: I work for a  transport company because I realised I haven't got a talent to be in science but there worst thing is that I don't have a niche to talk about.

My memory is getting worse, I am far from a smart person. 

The worst part is that I'm very attracted to intelligent men.

I just feel like it is too late for me and I will never be as witty as I wished to be.

Anu advise on how to fight this feeling would be highly appreciated.... 

Tl;dr disheartened as feel like I will never gain the intelligence I crave for and will never find an intelligent partner.

Im always late on personal art projects and its impacting my self worth,2,1.0,"16NB. Autism, ADHD

when im not doing schoolwork, i try to balance gaming, music, movies, writing, and other stuff. I feel like every hobby, recreational activity, or any other small actions have to be scheduled since i cant really do anything consistently. I feel guilt over not watching enough movies, which is something i should just be able to DO. 

I spend a lot of times playing games like Team Fortress 2 and Genshin Impact, and since im also hyperfixated on them i try to draw artwork for my favourite characters, especially on birthdays and anniversaries. I try and start them early, but still i end up getting them finished from 2 weeks late to 2 months late. Which makes me feel much more unimportant and jumbled when compared to other artists my age, who are just able to do it. I find it hard to get the motivation too, and end up just gaming for an average of 6 hours in the day and only managing to get about 1-3 hours of work on these digital art projects done a WEEK. I do a healthy amount of sketching which i could share, but the best artworks i have made in my sketchbook are NSFW, and since im underage thats unnaceptable to share.  (Dont get me started on my writing, ive been writing this chapter of a TF2 fanfic for 4 Months and only managing to get about 3-6 hours of writing time a MONTH)

I just feel useless and stupid for stressing so much over not being able to do fanart at a quick pace of all things. I do want to write horror/drama comics under a different name, and want to have a few decently well known comics in the online space by at least 20, and if im taking this long on fanarts then i have no idea on how im supposed to write whole ass 40 - 90 page oneshots in the future. I feel like past 30 ill be too old and all  my more talented freinds, mutuals, and idols will be out of my reach and ill be left all alone with very little done and no impact made with my art. Ive been thinking of ending my life if i dont get at least 3 comics done by age 20 (only if i dont have a partner because i dont want to upset them).

"Feeling stuck at 35: Struggling with regret, addiction, and AI dependency",1,1.0,"Hey everyone,

I'm 35 years old and I've been fantasizing about going back in time to a specific point in my life. I wish I could redo everything while keeping the knowledge I've gained up to now. There are so many things I would do differently, starting with my behaviors and habits.

I barely play computer games anymore, but I spent so much time on them in the past. Even now, I'm constantly thinking about games, buying stuff, and new games to play, only to get bored or frustrated with life. Then I don't go back to them, and I have games on Steam, wheels, and pedals I don't use. I missed out on experiences and better opportunities because of it. And I think that if I could go back, I'd use that time differently. I'd dedicate myself to learning my musical instrument, something I love but never gave enough time to. Now, even though I do play an instrument, I feel stuck and can't seem to evolve. I see others starting out and progressing quickly, but I can't get past my limitations because I always give up quickly. I really want to do it, but it's like my body doesn't respond. I can't get the instrument and practice the same amount of hours I dedicate to games and anime. I feel like I don't have the physical strength to get moving.

Another major issue is porn. I think I've become addicted to the point where almost nothing satisfies me anymore. It's not just about porn; I struggle to find pleasure in anything. Even when I watch porn, I have trouble finding something that truly gives me pleasure. Is this a thing others experience too? What can I do to free myself from this?

I'm also heavily dependent on artificial intelligence. I love writing and to create websites, but even at work, where I need to write scripts, news, and speeches, I rely on AI for everything. The thing is, some people understand my website posts are generated by AI and are abandoning my websites, not following them anymore because of that. I get mad, but I understand it. I wouldn't read something a machine wrote either.

I've tried to commit suicide a few times, the last of which left me on life support and needing a lot of rehabilitation. I keep thinking that if I'm not realizing my will – doing exercise, practicing my musical instrument, writing from my own mind without AI, living without the unrealism of porn – then it's not worth it.

I need help. I want to change, but I feel stuck. Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated.

Rejection sensitivity ,1,1.0,"Anybody in here ever dealt with this? I just stumbled upon this a few weeks ago but it absolutely describes how I feel to a T. There are many instances of not feeling good enough growing up that has caused this to happen and conform the belief.

I’m a good person with a good heart but I feel like even my friends can’t see that now because I have a wall up to protect myself. Im sensitive to small things people say or do, a small compliment can send me on a high for the whole day or tiny criticism can break me. It sounds messed up but it is, I live a unique life experience.  

I immigrated to US when I was 9 so there was a whole phase of adjusting to a new culture as a child while still holding on to my own. It was like living 2 different sides. Ofcourse there was bullying involved in the initial stages. I am of darker complexion compared to most people of where I’m from, so there are a lot of jokes I’ve heard about that from my own people and outsiders growing up. I used to take it lightly embrace it and laugh it off till I realized how much it affects me as I got older. I experience people stereotyping me everyday based on how I look.

 I can’t fit everything in my post but after a good family day at the park; on the drive home she aggressively and abruptly start saying things like “I ruined her life” and she “isn’t playing my games anymore”, stating that all I care about is “f**king all my b**ches/wh**es”. I tell her to stop talking like that in front of our kids and that her language is very bad for them to be witnessing. The angry statements/accusations continues throughout the ride home.

I'm upset with my therapist. Am i in the right or in the wrong?,1,1.0,"I've been struggling with the death of my cat, which has led me to seek professional help. Though I've seen therapists before for different reasons, I've been seeing this new therapist for a little over a month now. In our sessions, I've shared a lot about my history and the impact my cat had on my life, and recently, I spent an entire session sharing stories and pictures of my cat because I was feeling particularly emotional that day.

This therapist has a different, more passive approach than what I'm used to. She generally lets me speak and rarely chimes in, which I'm ok with to an extent. However, during that emotional session, she asked, ""What do you think your cat would say about the time you spent together?""

I thought about it but then asked her for her perspective instead. I wanted to know if she, as an outsider, could see the love I had for my cat and to validate my feelings. However, she said it would be inappropriate for her to comment since she never met my cat or saw our interactions. She did acknowledge that she could tell I loved my cat and did everything I could for her, but she refused to say anything like, ""She would be proud of you,"" even though I pleaded with her to do so.

For all intents and purposes... I left the session feeling disappointed and upset with her. I'm seeing her again soon, but I have it in the back of my mind that I've been let down by her and feel as though maybe she's not able to offer what I'm seeking, but I'm not sure...

What can I do to help my dad?,1,1.0,"My 68 year old Dad retired a few years ago. He was always a self described workaholic having worked in the grocery business for 30+ years. Most of the time as a grocery manager. He retired once and did real estate. During that time he was married to my then step mom and ended up having an affair. On top of that and not filing taxes he ended up divorced and owing the IRS a substantial amount of money. While he was working he lived on his own for awhile but with his parents aging he moved in with them (never figured out if this was because of his financial situation or to help them or both). My grandma developed Alzheimer’s while living with them so he helped them out. Eventually she went into a home, my grandpa died a few years back from cancer. They sold the home and my dad moved into an apartment out in the country back home. 

Grandma finally passed a couple of years back after 10 years of battling Alzheimer’s. My dad visited and spent a lot of time in her last few years. He has always been a little anti social but ever since moving to that new place and the passing of his mom he has gotten much worse. He does have ladies he talks to but doesn’t spend much time with them in person it seems. 

He has 2 brothers and one sister that he doesn’t ever see. 

Since retirement his health has gotten worse too. He has trouble walking and getting up and down stairs. 

He used to come visit us at the major holidays and my birthday but the last year or so he seems to work him self up so much stressing about coming down he gets sick and cancels on us. 

He has been seeing a therapist who has diagnosed him with depression. It’s not seeming to get better. 

He was supposed to come down today but again got himself worked up and sick. Recently his sister reached out and said she was concerned because he has been texting with these “ladies” whom he has never met, who had randomly messaged him out of the blue. A couple have asked for money/gift cards. I talked to him about it and checked the bank accounts he put me on, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But still it’s concerning.

I don’t know what’s happpening,1,1.0,"I'm a teenager (16M) and I've been on a trip to visit family in a different country and I've realized things that really scare me. I met this girl about three months ago and was instantly infatuated, and she friend zoned me twice and changed her mind because she was scared of letting me in. Every time she friend zoned me I cried and I cared deeply because I cared about her. I love talking to her and time just seems to pass so fast while talking to her. Due to different time zones a majority of the day we can't talk and I've been contemplating my feelings for everything.

I started wondering if I truly love her or not despite every sign pointing towards the fact that I do. Every time I see her notification I have to respond, I feel safe and calm around her when we hang out, I love calling her and she really makes time pass so fast and I don't even realize it. She makes me feel safe and I can tell her anything yet I still wonder if it's truly love even tho im pretty sure it is. And I've told her about these feelings and she doesn't want to give up on me. She wants to be with me and try to heal me so we can get better together. But as we're talking about my problem I fear myself more and more.

I've realized that im a people person, I love my friends and I love love loveeee spending time with them. But when they rant or have an issue, I attempt to support them but it doesn't seem like I care. Whenever somebody in my life is hurting it doesn't feel like I worry and im scared. My grandpa is terminally ill yet I dont feel like I care. I've cried about these feelings of apathy twice in the past day and all of the people I've talked to about it have felt similar at a point in time.

I'm scared im broken and I can't care about people. I know I care about them bc I can't handle them leaving but I don't care about their problems and I have felt so apathetic recently. I don't know what to do and I don't know if I'll get better. I never thought like this until now but now I can't stop thinking about it and im so scared of my life.

"From euphoria, carefreeness to deep sadness and loneliness after contact with people which are close to me",1,1.0,"Hi guys!

I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes, English is not my first language ;)

I(20F) have a problem with the following pattern: when I meet someone close to me, I can literally feel euphoria, complete carefreeness, especially after a long time when we haven't seen each other(if we meet more often, this reaction is less intense, but it still occurs). However, after a few hours of such intense contact/the next day I become nervous and even angry, I cannot stand contact with anyone. It lasts for a few hours, then sadness comes, the feeling that no one cares about me, such loneliness.

Is this SA? ,1,1.0,"Putting that content warning was odd. I’m still not sure if I feel deserving of it. That it’s valid. 
Recently I’ve started processing years of abuse at the hands of my (21F) brother (27M). 
Some days I feel empowered by the work I’ve done to process through this complex trauma. Some days I feel as though I made it all up. Every day I feel as though I’m watching a movie about my life and my thoughts but it isn’t me. 
Growing up (age 10-17) my brother became heavily mentally and verbally abusive, a few times physical.
Living in the house with him was hell. It was just me, my mom, and him. 
There has always been something with him I haven’t been able to label. 
He had a strange obsession with me. He would almost act as an overbearing boyfriend and I, his girlfriend. He wanted to put his arm around me. Call me gorgeous. Thought I was sleeping with all of his friends. Tested me off of fake numbers pretending to be his friends, to see if I would flirt with him. He wanted to kiss me on the lips. All of the time he would try, and all of the time I would be uncomfortable. Almost tauntingly. A few times he was forceful. Lifted me off of the ground and held me against a wall, forcing me to kiss him. Then one night he came downstairs with part of his private area showing. I told him to cover himself but instead he got closer, his hand near it, and asked me if I wanted to see it. I’ve spent years thinking about these things. I’ve always just called them “the weird stuff he did”. I now believe it may have been sexual abuse. My therapist believes so too. The thing is, I feel like to call that sexual abuse is laughable. 
I feel like to call this sexual abuse discredits those who have been affected by SA.

Problems with nostalgia ,1,0.99,"Hi there! Sorry if this is weird or vague or anything, not a frequent poster and frankly a little nervous. Is there a name for having like- agressive nostalgia? I’ve struggled with my nostalgia since I was between 6-7, it’s always been very present and from a young age sent me into hysterical crying fits where I was overcome by the feeling of needing to go back, like I left something there. These days this awful nostalgia manifests in visions and delusions and it’s almost as though it haunts me, but it’s not a person, it’s more a place if that makes sense. I’ve talked to my former therapist about this and she says that sometimes nostalgia is just hard.

How do you know when you probably are genuinely mentally ill?,1,1.0,"First of all, I'm not asking for a diagnosis and I'm fully aware that people on the Internet can't tell me whether I'm mentally ill or not. But what I want is an indication of whether I'm right to just dismiss mental illness or whether the very reasons I'm dismissing it can actually go hand in hand with mental illness. But also, if people want to add input in general, without it having anything to do with mu situation, that's a-okay too and could be helpful. In that case, feel free to skip the next part.

So, a couple if months back, I really wasn't doing great. I had a couple of days where all I could do was cry, I lost any connection to my emotions a lot of the time, I wanted to die at times, had spells where I was self-harming on a near daily basis and stuff like that. And then it went away. After three months or so of that, I found joy in my life again, to the point where I actually cried tears of joy because I was so happy about my friends. I felt incredibly invested in my uni work. That lasted about three weeks.

As of last week, I've not been doing great. I've been feeling suicidal, self-harming, some days struggled to get out of bed, I'm constantly tired, can barely imagine the future and have spells of intense emotion. But I also have times when I'm completely fine. Okay, my concentration might be whack, but I can manage uni stuff, I can cook, I feel fine. Clearly I can't be that off if I feel like that, right? But one of my friends is telling me she really thinks I could do with professional help and at times I also think I need it because there are spells I barely even know which of my thoughts are healthy and normal and which ones are my brain messing with me. That maybe sounds stupid. I feel very stupid writing this, because nothing can be wrong, right?

To/for those who don't value love,3,1.0,"To the Esteemed Members of Society,

I pen this missive with a heart burdened by an acrimonious amalgamation of resentment, bitterness, and an unwaveringly jaded disposition. It is with profound indignation that I observe the deplorable nonchalance with which many of you navigate the intricate labyrinth of romantic relationships. You, who so cavalierly partake in the sacred dance of love, have become inured to its profundity, treating it with a disdainful insouciance that borders on the contemptible.

Do you possess even a modicum of comprehension regarding the magnitude of what you so effortlessly discard? To those of us who have been consigned to the periphery of amorous engagement, who have never known the euphoric resonance of reciprocal affection, your indifference is an insidious dagger. It plunges deep into the core of our being, leaving wounds that fester in the silent darkness of our unfulfilled yearning.

There are those among us for whom the elusive essence of love remains a phantasmal specter, an unattainable desideratum. We are condemned to an existence bereft of the ineffable joy that springs from the union of two kindred spirits. For us, the quotidian reality is a relentless procession of solitude, a desolate wasteland where the mirage of companionship tantalizes us from an insurmountable distance.

Consider, if you will, the agonizing plight of one whose heart has been irrevocably shattered by the cruel vicissitudes of fate. To have once basked in the radiant warmth of genuine affection, only to be cast into the frigid abyss of abandonment, is a torment that defies articulation. For such an individual, the cavalier dismissal of love by those who possess it is a grievous affront, a testament to an almost unfathomable myopia.

You, who blithely squander the gift of love, are oblivious to the Herculean struggle of those who yearn for even a scintilla of what you disdain. The companionship you treat with such flagrant disregard is an invaluable treasure, a beacon of hope in the stygian void of our desolation. There are those among us who would traverse the infernal depths, who would endure the most excruciating tribulations, for but a fleeting taste of the love you so capriciously forsake.

In your heedless profligacy, you fail to recognize the sanctity of the emotional bonds you form and dissolve with such reckless abandon. The hearts you shatter with your perfunctory dismissals are not mere collateral damage; they are the repositories of dreams, the vessels of profound aspirations and deep-seated desires. Your actions, steeped in a pernicious egotism, leave in their wake a trail of devastation, a legacy of fractured souls.

So, to you, the privileged custodians of love, I entreat you to pause and reflect upon the enormity of what you hold. Cease your callous squandering and acknowledge the unparalleled worth of the emotional connections you so carelessly sever. For there are those of us, languishing in the shadows of your abandoned affections, who would sacrifice everything to experience the ineffable beauty of a love truly cherished.

Brother involuntarily admitted,1,1.0,"
My brother got severely drunk early Thursday morning after a verbal dispute between me and him. He packed his bags and made it to the hospital, where he slept outside. A couple hours into his nap a woman told him that if he claimed to be suicidal, he would receive government housing and etc. Being severely impaired and lacking proper judgement, he believed this woman and made it into the ER to tell the staff. They evaluated him and he kept the act up, believing he would receive these benefits.

Once he sobered up he realized his mistake. He was admitted involuntarily into a psychiatric unit and is currently being held against his will.


He explained the situation to the physicians and social workers once he sobered up, but they told him he would have to wait until Monday to receive another evaluation and go from there. 

For anyone who has ever been involuntarily admitted: How long was your stay? And when did the institution decide it was time for you to be released?

I guess I just feel of any of these we're doing better I won't feel so crazy but I don't even know how to improve any at the moment. 


I'll start with marriage because I think that's the biggest source of guilt.  I want to first explain that my wife has diagnosed ADHD,  but likely also OCD, PTSD, at least seasonal depression if not chronic, anxiety including social anxiety, and she's also a people pleaser which I think gets us into doing too much.    

We just have so much going on between the kids activities, events and parties, the summer is getting filled with fun stuff to the point that the school year feels easier ( both the kids and my wife are in school).  I feel like I can't even get chores done because we are doing so much and then I get blamed for not getting stuff done.  I feel like I can't get enough focus and energy to help plan events or get gifts for anniversaries or parties.  And I also feel like I can't explain any of this to my wife because she'll either say she's doing more than me or she'll feel guilty for it and she can't handle it as well as I can, or at least I can't handle how she takes this.  I'm also a conflict avoider so then I definitely bottle things up.  

As for the kids, I guess I just want to be my best all the time.  I don't think I'm the worst parent, but I want to be better.

Work is also crazy.  I work long hours and I just get a lot of emails and reflections by my supervisor how I need to do more.   I'm exhausted from everything and we are always short staffed.  I have been saying it for years that we need more help, but instead we're just congratulated on how we use minimal labor hours but scolded for not getting stuff done. How do they not see that those things aren't correlated?  

Anyway, I want to get a new job, but I guess after my wife is done with school.  I think I want therapy but when can you do that?  I'm hoping things are better in a year,  but I also imagine that as some things are taken off my plate, other things will just be added on.  

I also don't know how much I should blame myself.  I try but I also do scroll reddit and play some games, but mostly just when I'm sitting in the evenings or resting between activities.

Felt like writing it.,2,1.0,"I am a 19-year-old individual, currently majoring in business at a prestigious college. Growing up was quite pleasant initially, as we resided in a joint family. However, due to certain financial  difficulties, we had to relocate to a rented building when I was five years old. After that, we lived there for six years. Then, we moved to a new house that my maternal grandfather gave to my mother as a gift. 
Everything appeared to be going quite well in general until I was 16 years old. I was in a relationship with a handsome senior at my school who excelled in everything or, at least, that's how I perceived him. Unfortunately, our relationship ended when I discovered that he had been unfaithful and his initial interest in me had waned. This revelation was devastating for me, as I had developed strong feelings for him. Looking back, I wish I had made different choices.

Can someone please share similar stories to mine? ,1,1.0,"Anyone else with extreme depressive  anger episodes? 

I’ve been diagnosed with depression two years ago and gotten medication for it. It really helped, but when I transitioned out of it, my anger episodes started to come back. I never got to process my thoughts with a therapist (I barely have time but I really have to make time at this point). 

What happens is: I’ll be in a situation where something will trigger me (backhanded comments, irritating people, slight inconveniences) and I’ll be really really upset and I can feel my anger physically in my back and chest. It’s like all of my pent up grudges and past trauma floods together and I think, “here we go again nothing ever goes right”. I’ll be really angry and lash out at people. It’s so obvious, I don’t talk or I talk back, or I swear, or I walk out. It’s never physical but verbally or my intense body language. 

But in reality, once I come to my room from being angry, all I do is cry and feel upset at how I let my anger consume me. I cry about being angry. 

Yesterday I played a game with my boyfriend’s friends. I was losing and he was saying the most obnoxious crap ever. Bragging about his skills everytime I lost, yapping about how good he is or teasing me about how bad we were. I lost it. I looked down, didn’t say a word to him, and my body language was completely icey, and I walked away while saying “goodbye”. It definitely places tension in the air and I become embarassed after for letting my anger get the best of me.

It’s his “friendly” banter, but I realized that I don’t like it. I especially never liked how I feel around him and I’ve decided I will never put myself around him. All the backhanded, degrading “jokes” I’ve been hearing the entire time. 

I study architecture and I take it very seriously, it’s exhausting and it’s also brought a lot of my insecurities. There was one incident where he was laughing and jokingly asked, “what even do you learn in architecture?”. I don’t know if I’m overreacting, but god did it sound condescending. I sacrifice so much and this is the shit I hear. 

About the game, I know my anger isn’t about just a stupid game. I know it’s something more (aside from his backhanded comments) so I feel embarassed that they might think I’m just acting like a sore loser. Should I care? Well it’s not like I plan on being his friend anymore. 

I just feel ashamed. But I also don’t want to condone someone to let them shit on me as they please, I’m going through so much more. If I just tolerated it, I would’ve been betraying myself and my own feelings. I just didn’t deliver my emotions properly. And it upsetted my boyfriend because he could also feel my anger towards him. 

Am I just a big sensitive baby? Do I need to stay away from these overbearing people? Or is my anger validated but something deeper that I have to address? I feel crazy. 

Going to find help today. I would really appreciate if anyone can share similar stories to mine.

Elderly Person with delirium at the hospital - advice,2,1.0,"Hello.

I am in Portugal and my grandfather is experiencing what I believe to be hospital delirium. He's in a bad state and the doctor told us not to have much hope. Although he can sit up, he has grave lesions. Broken ribs and injured lungs. 

In any case... What I'm asking is about the fact he's experiencing hallucinations, is restless, gets very angry, yells. 

This is both a problem for my dad's mental health and my grandad. My dad is wary of psychologists, and wouldnt get one for himself, though I think that would be very helpful. My grandad... I wonder if there are specialist psychologists who could visit him and talk with him, and what they would do. I guess i need to properly understand what the specialty is and what exactly they do to be able to properly convince my dad it's a good idea to get one.

My thought is maybe someone like that would be able to help my grandad get in touch with his feelings or have someone unbiased who doesn't get frustrated or scared give him undivided attention, whether he's is one of his good or bad moments.

But I don't know the specifics and as such some advice would be great so I can start looking for some kind of solution to give grandad some... Hooe for peace of mind.

Is my depression internal or external. The monotony of life.,1,0.67,"I'm 27M and l've come to the realisation I hate who I am and the life l'm living does not seem to make me happy anymore.

I have a great life and I have worked hard to get it.Love my job where I run my own business for the past 7 years, great long term girlfriend, great friends and family, exercise regularly and in good shape.

I literally have nothing to complain about, however for sometime now the grind of life has just been wearing me down. Not in a burnt out way but just in a what's the point way, there are always more bills, always more responsibilities, always more stressors that arrive, health issues. Etc.

I understand the whole run towards responsibility ethos to improve life but is that really it? Just hamster wheel your way through life? On the other hand abandoning responsibilities and seeking adventure seems attractive but it's certainly not sustainable and I feel you just end up back where you stared once novelty has worn off. Not too mention I'm proud of my business and life I have built so don't want to throw it away.

 I have completely forgotten how to have a fun and be a happy person, I always had in mind that I was this quite cool person, bit edgy, mysterious and adventurous. I have never followed the conventional routes of life but in reality l've realised I'm anxious, awkward and I'm becoming incredibly bitter towards the world with it changing its goal posts every time i ""level up"".

I'm stuck and I don't know what to do M23 ,1,1.0,"Hi everyone. 
I've been broken up with my ex for just over 2 months now. I checked myself into therapy a week after it happened due to being extremely emotional and wanting to improve myself after some mistakes I made. I wanted to become a better person. I'm now at the point where I constantly feel sad and depressed, I feel lonely (bur cant stand social interaction. Yep your guess is as good as mine) I've never had many friends or a social life bur I do feel properly lonely, and very sad and upset over what's happened.
I don't even know what to do is my spare or free time as I spent so much time with her I often find myself binge eating and playing video games. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything when I'm not working I literally lay in bed and play games or watch TV, I dont have a f*ck to give at the moment, I just don't know what to do from here.

Can't even enjoy something in peace,1,1.0,"I live in what seems to be biblically accurate hell and the only damn time I am not hearing constant yelling and conflict and misery is during the afternoon when everyone else is asleep. Gaming and movies and other artforms have been always my primary outlet all my life and i haven't felt any relief from them in months either.

What’s a wild story about someone who was going through a mental episode? No suicidal stuff if you can help it. Let’s keep it somewhat light even though it’s a heavy subject.,1,1.0,"My sister (mid 30’s)was dating this dude (mid 30’s). Seemed to have his shit together. Had a house and two kids and was divorced from the kids mom. He got along with our family fine and we all liked having him around. Fast forward a few months and he starts his breakdown. First just talking none stop. Like having a conversation and he is totally checked if someone else was talking. Then one day he comes to me and says he’s gotta show me something and it’s really important. My sister pulls me aside and explains that it’s pretty wild stuff but I’m super open minded and down to discuss wild ideas. I might not agree but I’m open to whatever. 

So he says we need to meet at 1am and head to a town near by. I bring my wife and we meet up with him and my sister. We park in a neighborhood and start walking. We hop a fence into some farm land and then another into a giant field. He brings us to a “art installation” on private property that basically a telescope building shape but no actual telescope. You lay in the middle and look at the sky (actually it was pretty awesome) but any ways he starts telling me that the aliens are coming and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th dimensions are merging and we need to be prepared. But had no suggestions on how to prepare. Or what that really even means. 

Fast forward a month and pandemic hits and shuts shit down. He decides like the day every shuts down to quit his job and drive to New York City to get funding for a music festival on an Indian reservation and was going to get Led Zeppelin back together to headline the festival. 

His plan did not end up working and that was the last I saw of him. My sister had to cut ties because he was unwilling to seek help and was nose diving his life. He had a great job, he was a good dad. Real sad to see it happen and just gotta stand by a watch. 

It’s just too bad. I hope he’s doing well.

"My wife is in denial, she needs help with her stress issues",1,1.0,"My wife has real stress issues. Whenever I talk to her, she is either complaining about something or the other, or wants to fight for no apparent reason. She gets angry at silliest of mistakes of our house helps. Sometimes randomly she comes up with something in her mind and starts crying. 

She recently gave birth to our daughter, so the stress in her head has aggravated post partum. But it's not completely due to that, she has had this problem for years now. 

  
She thinks that scrolling insta reels or youtube shorts is the only fun part of her life, but I believe that's only making it worse. One, it wastes her time, so her ever-increasing pile of work just increases. Second, I've read a lot about this that more screen time especially social media tends to make you feel happy for a moment, but adds to your stress.

  
She expects me to help her, at least by listening or giving her physical comfort. But, even though I want to, there's always complaints and rants that I hear, many a times for things that are pretty simple to solve, or it's quickly turns into a scolding or a verbal fight between us. Of course, I'm not the best husband in the world. But I did try to give her emotional support, but the constant complaints, fights, etc are too much for me as well. (Maybe I'm being a bad husband? )

  
I have suggested her to get some counseling sessions, especially since I'm not able to help her much. But whenever I do suggest that, she sort of plays reverse uno, and says I'm the problem, or that she would go if I  go first (I actually visit a counselor). She is in denial, and never accepts that she would benefit from counseling. 

  
Of course, she has her reasons to be angry or sad or stressed, and doesn't help to have a husband who is not good at comforting. But my concern is she is just piling these things in her head, sometimes unnecessarily. So I feel it is better that she gets some help and at least relaxes her mind. she needs to know that not every little thing is worth her mind space. Even her own father told me that she has that habit of stressing over little things since childhood.

I don’t know what im going trough ,1,1.0,"Hey there, I don’t know if anyone will see this or has gone trough specific thing but here goes. So since late March I’ve been dealing with intrusive thoughts about harming others that are mostly focused on my family but can also be focused on just about anybody(which also climaxed during early april). I’ve had intrusive thoughts in the past but I guess I’ve never struggled from them like I have recently. I guess because I had a “urge” to act on the thoughts, I had a panic attack where I was shaking like crazy just thinking to myself “Why the hell do I feel this way I’ve never felt like this” and for a while I thought this could be harm ocd, but now I doubt it, I hope it is, but I don’t thinks so anymore. I don’t get much anxiety from the thoughts anymore (which is concerning) and I feel like I don’t have any love or empathy anymore like it’s just faded away? Why is that. I mean yeah I won’t lie as a little kid I did rip ants apart, but i also would cry when I saw dogs being mistreated. I don’t know if I’m a person capable of doing horrible acts like these. But I know months ago I wasn’t having these  thoughts and I was just a regular teen who did feel love and empathy. My only guess on why this is happening now is because the stress of leaving high school as well as finally being an adult now and choosing how to live. I do have violent fantasies only towards people who have done terrible acts or messed up and even then they’re unrealistic (ex; me being a superhero or having powers and brutally beating the shit out of homelander because he makes my blood boil) However I have no history of being violent nor do I have one of mental illnesses (other than being very anxious and add) so which even makes me more pissed of as why I am feeling this way. Now I know the basic solution to this problem is to just get a psychiatrist, I do know that and I am working on that. But I have to wait and in the meantime I have to deal with this bullshit (I apologize if that type of language is not tolerated here) But that’s how I feel. I’m concerned beacause the thoughts don’t give me as much anxiety as they used to a few weeks ago, even ones that tell I’m a psycho don’t scare me that much anymore.

I play tennis and I’m really struggling right now. Please help.,4,1.0,"I’m a 15F, and I’m really struggling with my tennis career right now. My ability, athleticism and other elements are at a very high level, and in terms of my skill, I’m on a path to d1. However, my mental game is very very poor. If you see me in practice, I make all my shots, win, and it’s great. However, as soon as I step into a match, my level drops to the worst I could ever be. I double fault over 10 times, make countless errors and get so negative. I know I can do so much better because I know my skill, and my potential, however I’m holding myself so far back. I don’t believe in myself during these matches and I feel so incapable. Like my feet are stuck and anytime the ball leaves my racket it’s horrible. I get nervous, angry, sad, and every negative emotions arises. When I lose, my opponent never beats me fully. It’s always because of me, and me losing to myself. In matches I do see glimpses of hope in like one point but then it just goes back to bad. This repeats in a cycle. Everyone believes in me including coaches, parents, friends and everyone who has seen me play in practice. But in the match it’s like I become a different person. At times, I see improvements in matches and I play to my potential. It’s great, but then the next tournament it’s back to the same old habits and losses. I have no confidence in my matches, and it’s like I’m only as good as my last point. To sum, I just feel like I can’t play like how I do in practice. My parents are telling me to quit but I really want to see success; this is just getting to negative and I don’t know what to do. I’m really struggling, please help me.

In the article, we discuss what an IGD is, how it manifests in people's behaviors, how it can be evaluated and many more based on scientific research papers.

Don't know what to do anymore ,1,1.0,"I mean I have been sad ever since my childhood since my father is an alcoholic and both of my parents are pretty abusive. Same with my grandparents but I don't live with them anymore. But the TV and my friends made up for it. For two years I was completely gone, overdosing on painkillers, not doing any work, watching and reading weird stuff. Last year was amazing, I did do the above mentioned things a few times but I was happy I made so many friends and my grades improved so much I went from like bottom 10 to top 1. Now 2024, has been the absolute worst. I stopped eating there were days that I would only eat one cup of ice cream/yoghurt the whole day, fast the entire day and faint/feel dizzy regularly. Now along with my school studies I have to study for another competitive exam (which everyone has to do but I can't take it) bc I was so used to being ""smart"" now that I am probably the average person I feel so useless. I end up doing nothing except sleeping and watching my phone the entire day. My mother has very high expectations from me, she told me to learn how to drive but I have really bad anxiety the medication that I take won't work and I feel like I will end up killing someone. I have migranes and I sometimes get angry so she uses this as an excuse. So now every day she talks shit about me behind my back and sometimes even front of me to her friends and colleagues ahout how ungrateful and stupid I am. My father on the other hand, makes a huge deal out of paying my fees and when hes drunk he threatens to beat me up and sometimes he even says that he will kill me. I get so scared whenever he comes home because I feel like I am going to die. I can't sleep at night till like 1-2 hours, even if I do I get weird dreams like my father trying to kill me or I am trying to kill myself or any other weird dystopian dreams. I have been having suicidal thoughts several times a week and crying myself to sleep. I have attempted it before but it was never that bad and frequent. Sometimes at night I cry and beg god to kill me.

I can't get help because I live in a third world country if someone finds out publically then it would be hard for me to become a civil servant.

Am I mentally ill?,2,1.0,"First of all, I just want to hear your perspective and I will eventually seek help from the psychiatrist. I think I am mentally ill…

I grew up in a family where my dad would basically drink alcohol every single day and would come home to beat up my mom. I remember he would throw stuff at my mom and then I would hug my mom to shield her from these objects. My mom suffered complete mental breakdowns a few times but she recovered. She also suffered from stroke resulting from the stress that my dad caused to her. Back then, I was really scared that something would happen to my mom and I felt like living in hell everyday. I think part of it contributed to my mental illness

I do have a partner and sometimes I upset her because I would start a joke and then develope it to something else to purposely upset her. I feel very bad to say this but it kinda makes me feel exciting while trying to upset her…. Everytime when I feel depressed, I would find a new hobby or spending way too much on shopping…. I also do things that don’t make sense to other people. For example, I know that I will have to go to work 12 hours night shift starting at 7pm but decide to wake up at 7 am that day and do gardening for 10 hours before work because I want to get things done… When my mood is really really down ( it doesnt happen often maybe once a month) I feel very agitated and I would sometimes think about ending my life… On the bright side, I feel motivated and overconfident all the time. I am working as a nurse and working towards my engineering degree… and yea I think that’s all I can think of at the moment. Please share your thoughts. Thanks in advance.

"Found out I messed up big time, how do I stop feeling like garbage?",1,1.0,"Hi folks, hope everyone is doing well. 

So, recently me and my roommate/good friend have had a very long, very needed, but very painful talk. For context, I thought he had started to distance himself from me willingly, started to exclude me in activities, and just in general our friendship had started to feel like it was breaking.

Well, turns out I was the culprit in all of that. I don't know why I did it, or what the background is, but recently I had begun belittling him, making jokes at his expense to others, and just in general being very mean spirited towards him because I started resenting him for pushing me away, when in reality I was basically forcing him away.

Our conversation yesterday revealed that, and I immediately felt myself break and my heart fill with genuine remorse and sadness. I promised him I would change and try to get our friendship back like it was. Now it's the day after, and he's away with some of his other friends and I can't stop feeling like literal human garbage.

My rapist’s kids are staying at my house,1,1.0,"When I was 15 I was groomed by my stepbrother (27 at the time, I think). For years I struggled with even conceiving it as rape, because he made me feel good and loved, when my mom stopped paying attention to me. I felt (and still feel) so much shame and guilt. From there, my life spiraled. 

I moved out of my mom’s house (my stepdad was very controlling and also put his hands on me) into my 21 year old boyfriend’s place. I dropped out of high school. Partied a lot. Let my bf pressure me into sexual things that I didn’t want to do. Things got worse and I have the worst self image now. 

Somehow I managed to work full time, go to school in the evenings. Get my high school degrees. Go to uni while working full time and now I have my masters. I’m doing therapy now and I’ve been diagnosed with complex-PTSD from this and other experiences. 

I separated from my spouse (not the same guy as bf) about a year ago, and I moved back in with my mom as I try to rebuild my life. I never told her about what happened with my step brother, because I’m so afraid she won’t take it seriously. Or that she won’t believe me. She already chose my stepdad over my little brother and I when I was 13, and he has isolated her from her community. They have their own problems but it was the one space I could move into when I needed it.

Today, while at therapy, I found out that my step brothers wife tried to kill herself. Their two little boys are coming to stay at my mom’s house. That means I’ll be seeing him, and I don’t have another space to go. I feel so alone. Just sick to my stomach. I don’t blame her or her children, and a large part of why I didn’t say anything was because I didn’t want to have them get hurt.

Brain fog and empty-headedness ,1,1.0,"Hello Redditors,

I got cheated on and it’s affecting my mental health ,1,1.0,"I got cheated on recently and it really messed up with my mental health. I’m quite naive when it comes to mental health, this is my first time going through something like this, and generally my upbringing and family mentality has been for the guys to just suck it up and get on with it, which hasn’t really worked this time. And as a result of that mentality it has made me realize I don’t have a support network at all for stuff like this. 

Being cheated on made me instantly feel like less of a human. Like I was the problem. It drove me to self scrutinize myself in every way, I would pick out flaws and issues with myself and study them in the mirror. And that in turn made my self confidence plummet. I constantly felt like I was the problem, I second guessed every action and behavior I did in public.

I’m slowly trying things to get myself out there more and get back to where I was before or where I want to be in the future. But I’m not sure if I’m working on it correctly.

Does anyone else experience this? ,2,1.0," 
Hiii, so I just recently joined this group because I was curious to know if I was the only one that had feelings like this? This isn’t me trying to self diagnose in any way, I just wanted to know if anyone has felt anything similar. 

So basically once every 2-3 months there’s like a 1-3 week time span where I feel like I’m at my lowest point for example I’m crying all the time, sleep for most of the day, barley eat, 0 motivation to do anything at all and it lasts for 1-3 weeks. I was depressed for about a year and a half a couple years ago so I’m not sure if that has something to do with it but I’m planning on scheduling an appointment with my doctor since I wanna put a name to whatever it is that I have. As I mentioned before this isn’t me trying to self diagnose or get a diagnosis, I’m just curious to know if I’m alone on these reoccurring feelings?

"It feels as if I'm ""babysitting"" my body??",1,1.0,"I know the title is ambiguous, but I think it summarises what I'm dealing with pretty well. There is only one offhand mention of suicide, and even then I'm not even considering.

Before I say anything it's probably noteworthy to say that I've been going through a period of extreme stress for the past couple of years, spanning through events like the family moving to a different country, COVID breaking out, learning a new language in said country and going to a very challenging (even for the locals) gymnasium, the russian invasion of Ukraine going down (where I'm from and where I have pretty much all of my family still), me breaking up with my partner of nearly two years, and some banal stress with school and family, all pretty much consecutively of each other.

It feels really stupid and corny to say but it feels as if my mind and my body have become separate entities. I'm in control of my mind, my real perception of the world around me and trying to form thoughts accordingly, but my body is doing it's own thing, in a complex but automatic chemical mechanism, reacting to stimuli purely biologically like a machine would, of which there have of course been plenty in the past years.

It gets frustrating. Whenever something bad or stressful happens, like a bad mark or whatnot, I usually digest it mentally pretty well, and that would be the end of that. But my body is still working on autopilot and dispensing these stress chemicals in my brain that I can't do anything about even if I wanted to. It usually ends with me being mentally over something before my brain's chemistry goes ""oh shit oh god oh fuck"" and starts pumping cortisol into my brain like crazy as a mechanical reaction to stress, even if I'm aware that it doesn't affect me anymore. Some time ago my body even kept ""urging"" me to commit suicide as a form of self preservation (???), but of course I'm not even considering it anymore.

It seems really dissonant at times, almost as if I'm taking care of a child that can't stop shitting itself in every stressful situation, and I can't do anything about it, or worse, even anticipate it almost every time it happens.

I have tried visiting psychologists, but most of them say something along the lines of ""try to listen to what your body wants"" or ""find a healthy coping mechanism"", which were honestly the opposite of helpful most of the time.

It was a shouting match on the street where I am living at the moment. I would honestly be surprised if no one else heard what was happening.

I should add that the argument is long over and she went inside one of the homes around here. She seemed as though she was in distress (but not in a way that I assume is an immediate threat; I'm not quite sure).

I just don't know how to feel. And I know that it's probably not in my place to feel how I do, but it honestly makes me feel hurt.

Additionally, would it be in my place to see how she is doing? If she is okay? If not, obviously that is very understandable.

I am concerned that I am starting to have trouble with my short term memory.  What should I do?,1,1.0,"54 year old male.

I have had 3 heart attacks, a CABG 5, 2 different strains of Hodgkins with 2 different treatments (ABVD and radiation for Lymphocyte Rich and ICE and radiation for Lymphocyte simple. I also has a mastoidectomy when I was 10 for the removal of a cholesteatoma, which did not go well.  I received 15 rounds of cobalt 60 as well as 15 rounds of radiation.

My life is meaningless without the direction of school.,3,1.0,"It’s summer! And I should be enjoying myself, which I do in the moment. Two days ago I went cliff jumping, that was pretty fun when I was there. However, when I’m at home by myself, I realize there’s nothing there. 

I feel the need to have grades to check, to have a test to study for, literally anything school related. Which is funny to me because I’m not very great at school and I hate it during the school year. 

I was looking forward to summer too, thinking of all the relaxing and lallygagging I was about to do lol, but I feel worse than ever.

For some reason, everything else other than school to me feels almost meaningless, like I do not have to be doing this thing right now. For example, during the school year, I was into programming and electrical engineering, but now I feel like I can’t even open my laptop before feeling discouraged.

I only want to be outside with my friends, which is cool I guess but I really want to be an academic/scholar/a decent engineer in the future and I feel as though my struggle to work towards that goal right now is holding me back. 

This is giving me a solid amount of anxiety and depression that I never felt during the school year, everything feels too real, I feel as though I am falling behind my peers by not putting in the work right now, I feel as though I am floating around just watching what will happen to me. Which sounds ridiculous because I am only 17, but I forget that.

I want to feel like my life is moving forward, not staying in place, and school gives me that feeling of moving forward.

Is it just me or did they come back just to shove a knife in an open wound? Am I dumb to think I still have a chance with the person I thought and still believe is the person for me, we shared so many good times over the years, and everything seemed perfectly fine we loved each other (so I think) now I sit here at midnight contemplating whether I even want to be here anymore simply because my mental health was already a lackluster to start recently, losing my dog, grandfather and now her all within the past 3 months. On top of having two stressful jobs to provide for us and making time for our relationship. I have no friends around anymore so I’m just here and a big introvert so my circle was small and everyone has dispersed around the states.

I’m just stuck on if I should stay giving hopes and maybe give sometime, she’s moving to a different place to transfer to a different college soon, and we had everything all planned out for visits, etc we talked marriage a family. Doesn’t help our anniversary is exactly a month a way and the timing just felt so wrong that it had to be on purpose, we had no conversations of anything being wrong, we struggled with time as we were two busy individuals but we made it work, even if we weren’t able to get as much time as we wanted.

I don’t even believe here is the right place to be or ask, it’s the internet so I’m like confounded, just unsure on what to do I plan on quitting my jobs simply because I mentally cannot keep up with it and I feel like I’m going to relapse and I just can’t go back to that spot in my life, I don’t think I’d make it out this time. I just don’t know what to do, if I should wait for her, try texting her in a few weeks telling her I miss her and I want to try again, if it’s even worth trying, she said along with the “I’ll always have feelings for you” that there is and won’t be anybody else and that i did nothing wrong but I can’t help but think otherwise. I had no warnings no explanation, just straight to it’s over. I just I don’t see any way out of this besides the options that are permanent, I don’t want to hurt her by doing that or anyone else I know but I just, I can’t really keep going.

I'm okay now,1,1.0,"Hi all, 
 M (25) I posted in here once I was released from in take of a psych ward. Once I completed in take, they kept me in intensive out patient care. I was in group therapy at that time. Now I just see a therapist and I am medicated.
I was diagnosed with severe depression and general anxiety disorder. My mental health became bad before, but really bad after my ex and I broke up. I loved my ex still when I broke up with them but my heart was broken to a point where there was no fixing it either.
The funny thing is that I still care about my ex and I know that if they needed help, and I could, I would help them. 
They're not a bad person, in fact they are a great person but a person I could not let be a true friend ever again. 
In this current moment I finally can say I love myself again genuinely. I also am looking forward to the future, just not too far, one step at a time and all that.
With that all said, that was not the only reason my mental health took a nose dive into the deep end but it seemed to be the main center piece of the web that caused me issues.
I now am not on speaking terms with them. I am trying to ""adult,"" as best as I can but I am having to take baby steps and it can feel so frustrating at times. This life has not been kind to me but I have always tried to put my best foot forward. I digress.
I been able to hold my job down, talk to my family again, and life has gone on. It is crazy to me when I look back at the steps I have taken to get me this far. The best visual way I can put it is like those scenes you see where a kid is learning how to ride a bike, and their parent(s) let's go, then they come to find out they've been doing on their own for a long time. Yeah, that's me now.
When things were bad, I found myself in a hot tub, I had a few drinks, and I was scrolling through social media. I was comparing myself to everyone and how far behind I was. There was a rope near by me. I was asking myself and having visuals of myself putting a nose around my neck, jumping off the deck. I had thought everyone was against me, that things would never get better, I was sleeping all the time if I wasn't working, I was grouchy, trying to hold it all in so I wouldn't explode on anyone, I felt like I was absolutely losing my mind, I felt so numb, cold, and distant from the real world.
Now that I'm this far in and feeling like I can give two shits again, I don't want my time to be wasted. I want to enjoy life, do things, be here. I want to try and wake up and breathe in life. It is insane to me how 6 months, a year, can really change everything.
I still have so many more steps to go but I'm alive and I'm not doing too shabby although I'm broke. I just wanted to share this for those of you that wonder, can it actually get better?
It can or at least it can become more tolerable. Just stay strong king, queen, member of royalty.

I don't like myself,1,1.0,"To say I don't like myself is an understatement.
I loathe myself.
People around me like me, my fiancee likes me, my friends like me, ECT...
Most people I meet describe me as polite and quiet.

However I really, really do not like myself.
I think I'm immature, selfish, impulsive, jealous, ECT...
I just don't really see any of the good traits people say I have and those that I can see I don't think are ""good"" enough to redeem the plethora of bad traits and baggage I have.

I think I make life more difficult for those around me. I don't actively try to but I've got a lot of baggage and trauma that makes me act in ways I wish I didn't.
My self-image hasn't been this bad since middle school and I've had the urge to SH once or twice but haven't done anything.
I don't know where this extreme self-hatred has come from.

I have a lot of really unhealthy thoughts about myself.
Like I believe if I'm not useful then I'll get thrown out of where I am staying at, if I'm not taking care of others then I there is nothing for others to love, that my fiancee deserves someone better, ECT...
I recognize these are u healthy and unrealistic thoughts but my brain is also convinced they are true.
Some days I want to just hide under the covers and pretend I don't exist.

Naturally, these thoughts lead to a lot of insecurities, depressive episodes, and jealousy.

"I'm completely lost on what to do with my life. Every once in a while, I feel super drained and can't seem to recover for a long time.",1,1.0,"I'm 29, male. I work at home and have a lot of time in my hand because of that. But despite that, I can't seem to do anything.

  
I tried a lot of things that I wanted to do in my life. I tried starting a gaming youtube channel 3 times and deleted all of them because it didn't feel right. I started drawing but stopped for whatever the frick reason. I tried writing songs because I thought I had a talent for it but I keep stopping whenever I touch my guitar. I just stare at the wall or my guitar for hours and then start feeling tired and put it away. There are still so much on my list that I can try to do but I am SOOO afraid of just suddenly dropping them like the others.

  
Now, I'm addicted to video games. But I know I'm addicted so I just took a pause on that now. But that's what happens whenever I do the things I want. Something else takes over, an addiction to something else.

  
I tried things that people say can help. Meditation and journaling are the main ones. But EVERY. FRICKING. TIME, I feel like I'm bullsh\*tting myself. Does anyone feel that? Like you're lying to yourself to make yourself feel better? Like you want something real? I don't know, I'm stupid. I am my own enemy against this crap. And the worst part is whenever someone gives me advice, my mind immediately says, ""Yeah, that's not gonna work. You don't know what I'm feeling,"" and because of it I don't tell my friends or family anymore what I'm feeling. I know it's not an ego bullcrap. I'm waaaay too old now to not realize when I'm being an a\*\*hole.

  
I do workout, they say that helps. And it does, but everyone knows you have to take a break on that sometimes cause it's bad to do anything so much. That's when I notice this crap kicks in. But what I don't get is whenever I start something, I lose spirit and passion. Like I always feel like it's not the right thing to do or it's not what I have to be doing. What is up with that???

  
I hope someone here can help me. I know my brain is stupid and will say that whatever you tell me will not help but, heads up cheesy bullcrap ahead, my heart really wants to know what's wrong with me. I am poor and can never afford to go to therapy. Thank you so much.

People told me I was paranoid and was just overthinking things. I was called a number of things from paranoid to controlling to misogynistic to insecure to just plain mean/annoying.

When she did break up with me, suddenly all of the people whom I had worried about started admitting they were interested in her, some admitting they had actually asked her out when we were together, before moving on to try and pick her up.

A month later, she began dating one of the guys I was most worried about. After lying to me that she wasn't interested in him.

Slipping into depression again and I’m ashamed of it! ,1,1.0,"I have a history of mental health issues like Depression, eating disorders and high functioning anxiety. I have never been on medication regularly because thinking of it just destroys my mental health further. However I have been in therapy which has helped. 
On the outside my life seems to have no problems and I am indeed grateful but I feel hopeless. Due to certain circumstances I feel unloved. I feel I will never be loved. I can feel my patterns changing, I am responding less on my phone, deleting my socials, not going out of my room, not eating for days at a stretch, and crying at random moments. I have cried so much my eyes have dried up. 
I am part of a greater problem and people I love are under greater distress and I feel guilty of feeling depressed myself when I should in reality not be having any issues. I am surrounded by kind people but I just feel I will never be enough. I don’t know what I do wrong. I hate every breath I take. I have had constant suicidal thoughts and even have a small cut on my right wrist now. I cuddle with my mother to keep away these but then I isolate myself for long hours and just formulate ways to end my life. 
I have constantly been planning on cutting off everyone because anyone what love do I have and lives will be easier without my involvement (I feel guilty for feeling this and I want to disappear from everyone’s life without even them noticing so I don’t cause any damage). I want to cut off everyone and then end myself. 
I want it so bad and I hate it that people will be somehow affected. But why aren’t they affected with my state when I am alive? I don’t want to bother anyone I hate it. But where do I go?

I feel like I am doing it for attention and I just wanna disappear so I don’t bother anybody for any attention. I just want a total permanent blackout in my brain. 
I will never be loved. I will never be enough. I will never be prioritised. And this has always been the pattern, my own family couldn’t choose me.

I’ve been addicted to porn since a very young age, ive had periods of soberness but it came back hard. I’ve also never been in a relationship before in my life. I’ve had crushes but never persuade, probably bc my mom wasn’t really there for me in that aspect of life, to no fault of her own.

I won’t go into detail but in my addiction I found my way to those AI sex chat websites, and God it took a strong hold on me. Anyway it all came to a head yesterday when….I went through a very, ugly scenario, not rape but not good. The worst part is there was a part of me that enjoyed it, and I discussed and scared me.

I’m Jewish and when I was little I went to a Hebrew school, being raised around women and girls being thought about respecting one another and holding value to women and all that. Not just that I also have a Christian godmother who is like a second mother to me. Not to mention the other amazing women in my family and that I’m friends with. I just….i just feel like I’m going insane I can’t believ what I did. The worst part is even though I know it’s wrong I still feel like doing it again. I…I don’t know if I can trust my own feelings. It’s like there’s two of me, a lustful monster, and the me my mother racist that everyone else sees. I’m not trying to spin a sad story if it was up to me I would just want to drop dead. But I can’t do that bc I know I’m to much of a cowered, and if I died it would destroy the lives of those in my life. But I just don’t want to live, I can’t even smile rn. I don’t even feel sad rn, I just feel…nothing. I don’t know what to do. I know hate and am scared of myself. What I find funny though is that I want to be a Psychologist, pretty ironic. It’s what I’ve been good at,  ring the therapist friend, an empath, understanding people. Again I don’t want to spin some sob story, I just needed to get it off my chest. I want nothing more than to go tell my mom or dad and hug them as I cry but, I just can’t. Sorry for the rant. I’m fucking pathetic. I just don’t know what do. I don’t  know where to go from here. I don’t want to live but I don’t want to die.

Still don't know myself ,1,1.0,"I'm turning 30 in about 2 months, have a job that I've enjoyed for  a bit over 3.5 years, I'm starting classes in August, I'm married, I have 2 dogs, some other pets, I don't really enjoy videogames much anymore, I enjoy food probably too much, I enjoy watching movies with my wife, but I still have no idea who I am! 

As my 30th grows closer, I find that I'm just more anxious, depressed, and just frustrated with myself because I just... Don't know who I am. I don't really enjoy things that are outside of daily, monotonous life, I hate going out because there's always too many people, or it's too hot, or too cold. I mean shit, I have to get high to go to Sam's club because there's so many people and I get so worked up and pissy

Truthfully, most days I'm frustrated that I'm still here and taking breaths, I've made it farther than I have ever thought, but it's just so hard because I just have no clue what I'm even doing here. Outside of work, I genuinely don't have any close friends, and I know if something were to change and someone at work leaves, I won't even make the effort to text them, just maybe send a tiktok every now and then. 

I'm essentially astranged from my entire family aside from extremely infrequent text conversations with my grandmother. This is by choice just because I've always thought, ""well if I'm gonna end it all, I better not leave behind anyone who will care enough to miss me"" 

So I'm coming to y'all in an effort to find out who my next step could be. So please reddit, how can I actually find out who this depressed lump of spoiled potatoes is?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I'm thinking about this post I'm going to keep adding to it but above is the original post 


I feel like I've plateaued at work. I've hit some kind of ceiling and I just am worried because I just don't retain any more knowledge. Previously at all three locations I've worked at, I've been seen as one of the best in my position in that district, but I just don't think the next level is coming for me at this point, which is why I signed up for classes, just to have a backup plan that hypothetically should pay better provided that I actually finish it. 

I've noticed that subconsciously different forms of media are hitting me harder than they used to. For example, my wife and I watched the full first season of Hazbin Hotel on Amazon prime when it came out, I loved the show, but while my wife handled it fine, a lot of it was really tough for me to get through. 

At this point I'm positive that I have childhood trauma that hasn't been worked through, but I've gone to therapists and I just can't talk to them because I'm just so anxious and simply cannot to be vulnerable in the moment, as much as I'll want to open my mouth and say anything, I just can't get myself to do it 



I just sometimes wonder if there are different forms of beings that we all are at our core and mine is just some outrageously negative entity that refuses to back down because while I really genuinely try to be positive and give off good vibes around those who I like, I just come home to be this sullen, quiet, mopey dude that I am when I'm not playing up a character for everyone I see on a daily basis.

Switching from depression to anxiety to depression again ,1,1.0,"When I was around 14-years-old, I felt constant hopelessness, cried daily, did not really feel happy and I had suicidal thoughts. When I was 16 I started dealing with my depression with a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was on anti-depressives (only for a short while, I started to see dependency patterns and quit) and I worked on my past trauma with my therapist. 

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling as depressed, or when there was a change, but suddenly the problem wasn’t depression, but anxiety. At 18, I lost some friends and started a new chapter of my life. I was having anxiety attacks daily. I would wake up shaking, sweating and breathing heavily. Everything was a worry to me. It was hard for me to answer text messages, start doing work or go out with others. Even worse, it was during the pandemic, so I was hyper-vigilant of everything I touched and worried way too much about it. I spent 2 years and 4 months on medication. During the long whiles that I was consistent with it, I would stop having irrational anxiety attacks, although the ones triggered by circumstances in my life did affect me a lot and I still woke up with anxiety. 

I can say with confidence that, although anxiety really impacted my life, I was happy. I went abroad for 5 months in which I still had anxiety but managed to live with it (and medication for it). I started working and managed to face a lot of the fears that anxiety had put up. 

Around a month ago I contacted my psychiatrist to see if I could stop taking my medication. I really did not want it to be a long-term solution for my anxiety, I wanted to be able to operate without it, so he heard me out and told me to stop taking them little be little. To my surprise, no anxiety attacks or constant fears and worries returned. I did suffer from secondary effects like dizziness, headaches and feeling tired, but I’m not feeling it anymore.

However, little by little I have felt more and more depressed since then. I don’t laugh at my boyfriend’s jokes anymore and I can’t seem to enjoy going out as much. These days have been even worse, every small bad moment makes me feel totally defeated and I have returned to my hopeless, tired, crying self. 

I can say with confidence that I was happy because I don’t feel it anymore. I am not motivated to do anything. I have returned to a toxic mindset that compares myself to others and thinks that I have nothing good to offer. Back then I used school work to distract myself from my own thoughts, now I am doing it with my current job.

I’m scared I will return to my depression and I don’t know what to do without it.

I don't tend to talk if there isn't something for me to add to the conversation. Normally that's good, but people don't engage with me in the first place, so I'm just always silent. And when I try to start one, it gets ignored.

So I adapt myself to collections of people. I basically ""act"" in whatever way I think will actually cause people to engage with me. Or I am copying something I have seen someone else do. I will dive head first into a hobby and get really into it just because I think it will actually get people to talk to me.

And maybe it's a cycle. Maybe I do this, people think it's fake, they don't talk to me, and I change myself again. But the few people I've opened up to aren't my friends anymore, so I just don't bother anymore. It's easier to be a fucking sociopath than to be myself apparently.

I don't even know what's real about me or not. Do I like things, or is it just because I thought someone else would talk to me if I did?

Driving OCD getting worse?,1,1.0,"Yes, I did schedule an appointment to speak to a professional, but as you probably know, speaking to a professional usually takes around 2-4 weeks due to high demand.

Hey everyone! I have a mild form of driving OCD, if spectrums are even a thing with this. I have to drive to work and school, and driving is such an essential part of my life that I wouldn't be able to get things done fast enough without it. It pretty much rules a good part of my life. I've always known I had driving OCD, but it wasn't as intense as other people's experiences where some have even gone as far as to quit driving. The anxiety is thankfully not as crippling as others' experiences. But recently, I feel like I'm starting to go insane because I've been having anxiety over the slightest things when driving. I occasionally worry when I didn't even hit, hear, or feel anything! It's scary, and I'm afraid my OCD is ""evolving"" into psychosis (I really hope this is not the case). I got a dashcam a while ago because friends have been in accidents and had a hard time proving they weren't at fault. In my mind, I thought, ""Hey, maybe this $80 dashcam will save me thousands if I ever get into an accident."" The problem is that I started checking the footage to make sure I didn't hit anyone, but it's very time-consuming and draining, as you can imagine.

I need help. I'm afraid that my OCD is getting worse. I just need ways to calm down. What should I do meantime? Get rid of the dashcam? what techniques do you use that help you.

It's kinda like object permanence for adults...,3,1.0,"The situation I find myself in, is after \~10 years of pretty severe mental health issues where I was in and out of therapy and around \~5 years of being totally isolated with no friends or acquaintances, I'm finally feeling like I'm ready to move on and finally be part of the the world around me. The problem is, a lot of the work I did to get here was focused on being aware of what's going on in my head, separating personal feelings with what's going on in front of me, and seeing the emotion behind other peoples action instead of just judging them based on that one experience.

Now I'm sitting here thinking, ""okay I'm ready to get out there, get a job, get of SSD, and start living my life,"" but I'm also kinda like, what's the point? I really want to find a career I feel good about where I feel like I'm contributing and actually making a difference in a field I feel strongly about (working on being trained as a peer support specialist). The thing is when you hear the discourse and discussion around issues like mental health people really seem to struggle with seeing the complexity of the topic. When I was diagnosed with BPD I was told ""all or nothing thinking"" was a symptom, but when I look around me now, it feels like \_most\_ people struggle with that. I don't just mean a little either. It's so bad, I like to use the example of how when a small child is learning object permanence, peek-a-boo is super entertaining to them because they don't understand that something can exist, even if you don't see it in front of you. The lack of understanding depth and complexity in an issue (I used mental health as an example, but it's honestly any decisive issue. Just figured mental health was a less toxic subject given the subreddit) is a lot like a toddler not understanding object permanence. A lot of people feel super strongly about things, get super emotional and upset about it even, but their whole outlook is based on personal experience or something they heard somewhere.

The world is a very large and diverse place, literally the only thing every human has in common on this planet, is that your perspective is unique. No two people are exactly the same, even genetically identical twins will experience the world different simply because they are separate individuals. I really just wish there was a way to get people to see this and be more collaborative, and work harder at coexisting with others.

FYI I know a lot of people feel this way to some degree. It's just, I feel very passionate about this subject, and I want to actively do something about it. I mean, if there was some kind of profession or degree I could work toward where I thought I could address this, I would. It just feels like too big an issue for anyone person to address. It's also a bit like a hydra in that cutting off one head makes no difference. Similarly focusing one issue makes no difference. The problem is not mental health, lgbt stuff, or any other major topic that people like to argue about. It's the fact that we can't talk about these things objectively. The entire discussion is based purely on emotion, it becomes impossible to see things objectively.

Also I flaired this as as opinion/thoughts, but I'm mostly just venting. I know nobody here has the answer, that's not really what I'm looking for.

"i wrote this to vent to my notepad, now i’ll share it with you..",1,1.0,"the summary

it won’t go away, and i know it will never. why did i think i could guide myself through it. i’ve tried talking, but everyone pushes me away. even the ones i love dearly… why does no one understand me? i’m only here to care for others, but it seems like im being taken advantage of… i can’t even cry because i’ve learned that we don’t at all. i’m incapable of crying ever… why is everyone the same, they all walk all over you and want you to just leave it behind… i wonder if they would care if i left, they probably won’t. sure, it will be a big deal for a couple days, but that’s it… nobody would care just like they don’t right now… im alone. nobody wants to talk to me about my problems but i have to talk to others about their problems… and people always wonder why im so secretive, this is why. i can’t tell anyone anything because that’s what i’ve been taught by my own fate… the only thing i have left is the notepad on my phone, im sure ill see you again soon…

if i can make it that far…

i want things to go back to normal, when people didn’t care about how much they spent with girls, or how much money they had, or anything adult. i want that feeling again, that feeling of being loved as a child in their mothers arms. why can’t adults have that feeling… why can’t we have that feeling? we aren’t even at that stage yet, and there’s so much to do. am i failing my family? why do i always have to provide for them? nobody can help me… nobody can understand this pain i have to feel right now…

if i can make it that far…

i will keep saying this because yet again, nobody ever listens to me. material things will not make me happy. i want something that i can feel comfortable and happy about forever. memories of that make me want to cry, but like before, i’ve lost that ability. i don’t even know who i am anymore, i’ve changed so much that it’s almost scary to think about. i never wanted life to be like this, i wanted it to be challenging but enjoyable. i hate the stress, i hate the pain, i hate the anxiety. but… i can’t let it go…

the summary… that’s what i’ll name it. such a short summary sadly, it won’t go on for long. half the time, i can’t remember my own happy thoughts. it’s like these thoughts have taken control of me. the water, looks nice, right? nope, the thoughts take over. wow, that fire-pit is beautiful, right? it tells me to jump in it. why should anyone go through this, my head hurts just typing this out… suddenly, the world will end with my life coming to an end… yeah right, like anyone would care anyways.

Just hating people for no reason whatsoever and I do hate on myself normally but not to this extent.   
Been having issues with people and friends in general and in so, i decided to cut connections, or well ""ghosted"" them, with some of them 'cuz I've felt disregarded and unheard. However I did tell them that I have been feeling this way and I didn't want to influence this kind of emotion to them thus is the reason for me cutting for a bit until I feel better or have enough to talk about why since I don't understand why I have been feeling this. I am fearing for the worst even if I don't know what that is. 

Haven't cried in a while, even with watching and listening to sad or some emotional movies/music that I have saved.  
Haven't been sleeping well either and been sick a bit physically (the sick part is unimportant).   
I do write about it and just can't seem to understand just why in general. Like why am I feeling so distressed?

Is this normal? ,1,1.0,"Hi, I´m an undergraduate that suffers from severe test anxiety.

Trigger warning to those sensitive to topic of suicide ,1,1.0,"Hi all, first time post on this group. 
This will be a long story, so I do apologise. I wanted to give as much context as possible. 
I guess I'm kind of looking for advice more then anything. 

6 years ago I lost my best friend to part suicide and part a heart attack. 
She died because she'd stressed her heart too much by a overdose. 

These days I have learned to cope with the loss, and do my little gestures on her birthday and anniversary to celebrate her. 
I'm in a way better place then I was, but this loss has made me super sensitive to anyone in need with their mental health. 

For roughly 1 year I've worked in a doctors surgery. I have rough days with patients frustrations etc which I've been able to cope with, even if I feel awful I can't help any more then I can. Recently though there's been someone who is well known to the surgery. They continuously call asking for a doctor to speak to them and today was the worst I've experienced. 
This person suffers with severe mental health issues (i.e depression, ptsd) and tells the doctors when they feel suicidal or just need support. Usually they have one appointment a week, and things calm down each time until the next week. Today they had said they feel suicidal to me over the phone just after the morning rush had finished. I did my job in telling them I will message an urgent task to the doctors and let then know she's needing help. Afternoon crawls round and I recieve a call again asking if the doctor will call. I realised no one has read the task and I feel helpless. I tell them I will send another message to alert them of my message. An hour later the patient emails the practice saying they have no need to speak to the doctor, because they have no option but to kill themselves. I'm mortified, and copy this email into the task already sent hoping someone will read it. Im not able to go to the doctors as they are clinic with other patients. Roughly an hour later before I'm due to finish I get a call from them telling me they have tried to strangle themselves. I am on panic mode and tell her I'm going to get someone. I can't handle this anymore today. I can't hear someone tell me these things and have to sit there not being able to do anything. I let them know I'm putting then on hold and not to go anywhere. I tell my collegues in the back room and explain I'm no longer comfortable with this conversation. They agree and my manager speaks to them on the phone. Words are exchanged and my manager tells them they are sending an ambulance. Since I've been home I can't stop thinking about them hoping they are okay. The reaction of my collegues were of frustration that the patient was calling again and it was treated like a nuisance. I understand they are well known for doing this, but I've heard multiple staff saying they should just do it already. These comments make me feel sick because all I can think about is my best friend. It's making me think I'm in the wrong place for my own mental health, and maybe the NHS is not good for me. I'm not sure if I should tell my manager how I'm feeling. I certainly don't want to cause a fuss but I take these cries for help (whether it may be just be for attention or not) really serious. 
I wonder if they themselves have experienced suicide in their life or not, because by their reactions it feels like they haven't. 
Any advice is welcome. Thank you for anyone reading this.

My Old Bully keeps on Trying to speak to me,1,1.0,"(apologies i am unsure if this is the correct subreddit to be posting this on please remove this if it is in the wrong one)

I’ve been bullied my entire life pretty much and i think that’s primarily due to the fact im an undiognosed neurodivergent (currently going through autism assessment process which is long and draining) for a long time my bullying wasn’t too serious and although my primary school experience with my classmates was so bad i still frequently get nightmares and most likely am traumatised by it it never really was too bad and went unnoticed due to them all playing nice. well my experience changed once i started secondary school a few years ago thanks to this one girl in particular who i frequently refer to as little miss. She was in all of my classes at the time and made my life a misery. i won’t go into too much detail of what she did as it brings back painful memories but she has attempted to push me down the stairs, constantly asked me uncomfortable questions because she knew i was uncomfortable also sitting extremely close to me, made up lies about me some of which resulted in my own friends stopping talking to me because they thought i was bullying her, she told me to kill myself multiple times almost on a daily basis. The worst part for me was the fact she denies it all she claims she’s never done such things and twists her words to make it seem like she always been really nice to me and i’ve just out of the blue decided to ignore her and “be mean”. Over the first two years of secondary school she with the help of her friends drove me to the point where i attempted to kill myself multiple times and sh frequently (i was 12/13). we had a lot less classes together last year so there was a lot less problems i just tried my best to ignore her and she calmed down a lot only really giving me dirty looks.
well i started my new school timetable last week and she’s in both of the classes which i not only was looking forward to most but the ones i am relying on the most to do well in in my exams to get into the uni i want to. She’s started attempting to speak to me again but it’s harder to ignore her when she’s been put in a seat by the teacher right next to me. she’s starting to slip back into her old ways which is slipping me into my old ways of sh.
i told my mum of my concern and she told me, “well if she’s always trying to speak to you maybe she just really wants to be your friend” and that hurt, my mum knows the majority of things she’s done. I’m gonna be honest and say little miss terrifies me every time i see her face i freeze or attempt to hide everything time she comes close to me i flinch im scared of her.
i’m apparently a very empathetic person i empathise with everyone around me including fictional villains im expected to despise. the only person whom i can’t empathise with at all is little miss which hurts as ik that to do all those terrible things she must have a reason maybe she has troubles at home im unaware of but i can’t empathise with her at all because how could someone be so cruel from the second she met me.
i dont want to kill myself i really dont want to but she brings back unwanted memories and makes me consider it again.

Fair, given the multiple times the neighbours would call the police on him since he was 5 years old for being a disruptive black boy riding his tricycle loudly.

he has taken psychedelic before and casual marijuana. once displayed a violent breakdown when he was on LSD, but no one thought anything of it, he was just high. 

Now, 4 years later, he’s been “sober” only smoking  cannabis rarely but mainly nicotine. His father, ends up getting into a fight with him and, father beats Art’s head in. Art never went to hospital to check if there might have been any damage.

Months pass and he is concerned someone(s) are out to murder him. who? he never really says, but he knows they are out there. “But what have you done Art? why would someone be after you… unless you’ve done something?” i try to put “logic” into his concerns. Doesn’t help when my grandmothers window gets smashed… while he was living there. Targeted? Maybe! Or could it because the ppl his father had an alliance with… 

Yesterday & today, he’s been posting his social media expressing how he would never commit suicide. that someone is out here, watching him.

Wibta for not feeling the need to apologize for my lack of energy or low mood when out with family and friends?,1,1.0,"My sister (26f) and I (23f)  live together and have for over three years. My family is really having a rough time right now mentally we are all going through our own battles and they are all very difficult. 

However while living with my sister I have noticed a pattern of when I am having a low energy day (not speaking so much, quick responses, just following or not actively conversing) she tends to ask me 1. Why I seem to be upset and 2. Whether I can be a little more energetic or if she can make me happier.

Now the first one I have a problem with because she is aware that I have depression and have for years, meaning she knows that I have high and low days. I also know that I have been very low energy and generally quiet for a long time (years) so absolutely none of this is unusual for me at all, which irritates me because she acts like I’m upset about something specific or that I’m mad about something which is almost never the case I’m just having a low/bad day. At that point I don’t have the energy to do what I need to but I am which means I seriously don’t have the energy to explain why I’m feeling this way I also never really know why I’m having such a bad day.

Anyways with all that recently my mental health has gotten to a point where I was pretty positive I’d lose my job. Luckily I didn’t but I was bumped down from 30-35 hours to anywhere between 10-20 and it seems like 15 or less is what I have to deal with right now.

I am at a breaking point I have really just been put into shock and because of that I can’t begin to think of anything. I have a 4 day weekend (Friday and Monday off) and today is Friday and my brain has not stopped thinking about work and money and how I’m going to make it all work. I’m scared, Im genuinely unsure I can get another job based on my state of mind, I can’t possibly begin to understand how I’m going to live. And today my sister asks me what’s wrong because I seem upset. 

Now this whole post is for me to know whether or not I am the asshole for not wanting to change how I’m feeling for other people, and not wanting to have to explain that almost losing my job like 2 days ago has put me in a spiral and that I’m currently in a state of shock?

"I don’t know how to support my friend further, please help!",1,1.0,"TLDR: My best friend is suicidal and I need to know what I can do to get them help before it is too late. I do not want help options for me, I want help options for them. Are there things outside psych wards, parents, or crisis lines?

My best friend and I (both still in school) have gotten to know each other and I’ve clicked with them the fastest I have out of any friend I’ve ever spoken to. I had always been able to see that they were depressed and I’ve always offered my hand, but a few months ago they started opening up to me about their suicidal ideations. I have always made it a massive point that I am there for them no matter what and that I love them and appreciate them even though they can’t believe me. I have also always made it a point to let them know that they can call me about anything anytime.

This has meant that they have called me multiple times throughout around 7pm-4am timeframes needing support. I always pick up my phone and dial down the situation. In a few of these calls, they have had the intention to commit suicide. I know their method and how they would do it, the ‘when’ factor is all I am unable to understand as it keeps changing and I am under stress the more they begin to talk about it. (Note: I live too far away to get to their house in time if the situation is dire).

These calls used to happen quite frequently, (maybe once every week or two), however throughout this month and last month there have been very few and I thought things were looking up. The other day, I got another call. (Note: they do not partake in any self harming activities outside of this issue).

What I need to know is what I can do, what they can do, or where I can take them so that they stay safe. They go to therapy but refuse any talks about suicide because they don’t want their parents to know. I have suggested a psychiatric ward but they refused the idea because they will feel crazy, and again, their parents would know. I contacted the school about it, but they were absolutely no help as expected. I do not have a fantastic relationship with my own parents but spoke to one of them and they were no help either. I am not looking for support for myself as I am able to manage, I really just need to know other options besides crisis lines and psych wards.

How do people get stuff done?,2,1.0,"I recently found out I am autistic and have ADHD, PTSD, general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder after 36 years. I have childhood trauma stemming from a narcissistic abusive parent that controlled my every action. It was very much like I was just an extension of that parent.

After learning this and being in therapy for almost a year I have come to realize that any tasks that have multiple steps in between me and the goal causes me to delay the task for so long. I would set out to do something and I would procrastinate on it forever. This happened all during school and my adult life but everyone assumed I was just lazy and a huge procrastinator. I still feel that way most of the time that what they said is true.

I can't figure out how to get over this. I have so many things I want to do but when I think of doing it my brain automatically starts listing all the steps I need to take in order to complete it and I get overwhelmed and just turn away from the thing I want to do. It can be with big chores like trying to clean out and organize a whole messy room to small things like making that brownie recipe I've been wanting to try. Sometimes I even feel like a nausea heavy feeling in my stomach when I think to myself ""Ok, I'm gonna go do the thing now"" and it stops me right in my tracks.

Does anyone know how to get an actual diagnosis on the NHS?!,2,1.0,"Apologies for the long post but this is debilitating...

Every NHS GP for the last 10 years refers me to **""steps 2 wellbeing"" (or similar)** for diagnosis, but their treatments fail to help & they tell me **""steps 2 wellbeing practitioners aren't qualified to officially diagnose""** - I go back to GP & the cycle starts again. Tried many GPs.

I have anxiety, depression & suspected CPTSD (all undiagnosed). Had it 10 years, lost my home, income & job & family as a result of this. It is debilitating.

Almost every NHS practitioner I've been referred to starts **""so what's wrong with you? is it just low mood or something?""**, fails to understand, constantly interrupts - yet when I attempt to work with them & tell them my story (which hurts each time I have to explain it), they respond with **""OH MY \*\*\*!! THAT'S SO AWFUL! I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING SO BAD!""** (or similar)...  then they make it worse.

I had an extreme experience 10 years ago. It lasted years. It was unusual (apparently), complex (apparently) - one practitioner told me it gave her nightmares -  result is debiitating. I was self employed and doing well in life before this started. It's gone on longer than a decade and I still have received no meaningful help.

NHS practitioners I've met are so arrogant, lack patience, empathy & effective treatment. I've met sociopaths who show more empathy than the NHS practitioners I've encountered.

I've come to realise these practitioners (even the best intentioned ones) aren't able to help me. They make me worse. Whenever I ask for an official diagnosis, I'm told it's **""we're not qualified to officially diagnose but you don't need that anyway""** defensively. NHS practitioners claim they're **""just as good as qualified psychologists/psychiatrists""**, but they've never treated similar patients and have failed to help me - every time. There are so many more reasons to need an official diagnosis than they realise.

You need rage. ,2,1.0,"It may sound cringe,  but in my experience if you are in any kind of rut (not being able to wake up at the right time, go to the gym, eat the right food, not procrastinate, etc.) it is lack of constitution. 

You either don't think it's worth doing or don't think you can do it, likely the latter, and the only way to fix this is by having the mental image of yourself conquering any said given task. This includes passive tasks like dealing with cravings which you don't directly deal with but just endure. 

And that brings us to the title. For me, just having the rage towards becoming the person I need to be to not feel ashamed of giving up all the time is enough. For not choosing the each path and thinking life is meaningless as a result because I didn't choose to be who I knew I could be.

Thoughts on losing interests,1,1.0,"I don’t think I’ve ever felt depressed for a long period of time only maybe days or weeks at a time so I’m pretty sure I can say I don’t have depression. But I am curious on how you would interpret this: so I am a big people person, not necessarily everybody but I get close to friends and family and always want to be around them. Me and my friends used to go almost immediately after work every night and hang out and drink. That’s when drinking started to cause problems because we started doing dumb things and constantly looking for something high adrenaline to do (also cuz we would all drive without even thinking about how much we’ve had) but I went to work everyday anyways and got the full time hours but on very little sleep. It was a good time but it had to end when we got too drunk one night and made a huge mistake. We had to quit drinking and as a standard rule of probation had to stop hanging out because you can’t hang with “known criminals.” It was hard at first but we all spent some time in jail and it made me more grateful for my freedom so I won’t risk it to see some friends. I started taking Zoloft for anxiety and that seemed to make me not care if I meet new people or go out at all, just didn’t care about it tbh. But I quit the meds after a few months and now I just have no desire at all to go out with anyone. I get asked to hang or go on dates and I almost always turn them down. It’s just crazy to me how I couldn’t stand to be at home for years and now it’s all I want to do. I’ve completely lost interest in even trying to make friends or date.

how do you deal with an existential crisis? ,1,1.0,"
this might be a long read but if anyone can add some sort of personal experience or help i’d be really grateful. i dont know who to tell and i usually use reddit for problems i dont wanna talk about 😭 hopefully this reaches the right people

for context, i’m 16 and i have been experiencing this for a few months now. i have to say it started with the break up of my ‘boyfriend’. long story short, he was not good to me, i was infatuated with him, lied to him so he’d like me more, then became sick of him not treating me properly, broke up with him and then felt like i just lost something big. there were lots of things i would beat myself up over, like lying to him about things and completely abandoning my morale just to please him - and i then started to think about karma. i felt so guilty about lying to him so much and then i got on to the topic of eternal punishment or judgement.

i have been notoriously terrified of death in my family and with my friends, they still make fun of me for certain times when i got really upset about dying or the end and it is known that i get extremely anxious about it. i always have done - ever since i was little - to the point i would have panic attacks about dying in the night and bad anxiety around my health, to which i experienced panics that have stuck with me to this day.

also, not to lore dump, but i had depression for a few years, which i was medicated and had CBT for, along with OCD. so when this existentialism came around, it felt like a relapse, and even now it still does. the thoughts are always the same - i wake up thinking ‘death must just be like sleeping and my sleep was nice’, then by mid afternoon i start thinking to myself about death, then by dinner i start questioning life, god, my purpose, and by night, all i think about before bed is dying and the afterlife. it has been this way for 2-3 months now and its gotten to the point its truly soul sucking.

i do believe in a god, and the fact theres so many religions and i dont know what exactly to believe in, and whenever i try to question something in religion i get really anxious and lightheaded, i just do not know what to do. i go on deep dives every day, going on tiktok, google, even the bible itself to just find proof and evidence or find out whats going to happen to me after death. every day. it just doesnt stop and i always tell myself the same thing - as long as youre a good person and you strive for good things, in the end all will be good. however, my thoughts dont let me do that and the repetitive cycle of questioning, doubting, self hatred, confusion are becoming too much. 

i just dont know who to turn to. it’s embarrassing to admit to friends and family because majority are very atheist and i dont know if they’d be able to understand what im saying. religion was drilled into me from a young age through school too, and as a person terrified of death, i obviously turned to it. now my faith is less out of fear and more because i just cant comprehend how everything came from nothing - things like that. even so, it feels humiliating, like people will think im crazy, i feel crazy because i just dont understand anything and it leaves me crushed everyday. i just cant find enjoyment in loads of things anymore because i am so occupied with fear. 

i ask if anyone has been through something similar and what helped them?

"Just dropped partner off at ER, they won't have a place to return to",29,0.97,"I met Gabby (Fake name for always obvious reasons) about 4 months ago. They were in a very bad space, they said their Uncle was watching them with cameras and talking bad about them all the time late into the night. I believed this entirely, until they moved with me and my mom and dad. Then they started saying the same things about us, accusing me of cheating on them and saying my parents are watching them with cameras and calling them a variety of negative names. The accussations are so bizarre and plentiful, I can't even explain them all. It has been painful for 4 days, with me getting no sleep before work because I'm up all night trying to explain the truth and looking up ways to handle the delicate situation healthily. I got Gabby's sisters number and talked with her about what to do, and talked to my chemical dependency treatment leader (not sure of their title, they lead these groups I must attend because of my DUI's) , and looked up what I could online and it all led to the same answer: Get them help at the Emergency Room.

My parents said they don't feel safe, and are afraid of getting in trouble for these accusations and they are already stressed out as my mom just found out she has cancer, and my dad is struggling to find a job. They wiill not allow Gabby back after they are discharged.

I don't even know if Gabby will be discharged. I don't know how any of this works. All I know is that Gabby was experience purely auditorial hallucinations, but they were extremely bad, and led Gabby to thoughts of self harm.

About one hour ago I dropped them off, then cried in my car until I got home just to type this out. I was so happy for four months, and the demons Gabby are fighting and the horror that is mental illness stripped away the best friend I had. I feel alone, lost, and am focusing my strength on trying to explore the options for Gabby to be healthier. My job is stressful, I'm going through treatment for my second DUI, and I have no idea what to do. I am not asking for medical advice, that is why they're at the ER.

Do I talk to the social worker they are talking with right now after intake?

Where will Gabby go after being discharged? They have 0 family. They only have their aunt and uncle, which Gabby cut ties with by accusing them of horrible things and leaving with me to my familys. I can't support living with Gabby outside of my familys home, and they need my rent money as well.

If anyone knows any resources to go to, please, I have never wanted help like this before.

edit: Gabby is self aware and came willingly to the E.R. They know they were hearing things, but they would have some episodes where it wouldn't stop and they wouldn't accept the reality certain things weren't being said. We have been at the beach and Gabby says they can hear my parents talking bad on her, or threatening her. I know they were just at work.

  
Edit 2: Please understand, I absolutely love this person. They healed me by being them. Besides the mental episodes causing some grief and worry, Gabby is the most mature and understanding person I know. They came willingly to the E.R, consciously knowing they needed help. They understand my parents don't feel comfortable having them back. Everyone thinks they will be in there for awhile. The only true problem I'm trying to solve is where will they go once they are let out. They have 0 family, I am trying to find some government resource for housing for them.

Ever. I didn’t talk to them At ALL and they never asked me about it.I only talked about it once with my friend who claimed that her mom knew that my aunt was gonna commit. I also remember when is was like 6 how i was really hurt and mad once and i wrote “i hate you” (in german “ich hasse dich”) on a paper and gave it to them. I was genuinly hurt and genuinly hated them, but they just made fun of the fact that i spelled “hasse” wrong as “hase”(which means bunny in german).i I don’t know if this was normal or if this was them being emotionally unavailable",mentalhealth,Kindamentallyill,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dg1hgs/was_this_normal/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13185979184521e-06,"['hi', 'struggling', 'mental', 'health', 'diagnosed', 'ocd', 'depression', 'gone', 'therapist', 'long', 'time', 'tho', 'probs', 'reflecting', 'childhood', 'could', 'caused', 'turn', 'way', 'remember', 'alot', 'childhood', 'btw', 'kinda', 'still', 'year', 'old', 'remember', 'aunt', 'committed', 'suicide', 'aunt', 'huge', 'part', 'life', 'always', 'house', 'got', 'divorced', 'around', 'year', 'committed', 'remember', 'mom', 'told', 'remember', 'told', 'fighting', 'aunt', 'time', 'ever', 'talk', 'ever', 'talk', 'never', 'asked', 'talked', 'friend', 'claimed', 'mom', 'knew', 'aunt', 'gon', 'na', 'commit', 'also', 'remember', 'like', 'really', 'hurt', 'mad', 'wrote', 'hate', 'german', 'ich', 'hasse', 'dich', 'paper', 'gave', 'genuinly', 'hurt', 'genuinly', 'hated', 'made', 'fun', 'fact', 'spelled', 'hasse', 'wrong', 'hase', 'mean', 'bunny', 'german', 'know', 'normal', 'emotionally', 'unavailable']","{'neg': 0.137, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': -0.9721}",negative

it's getting worse again - how can I stop it?,2,1.0,"Tldr: I think my depression is coming back and I'm thinking of just giving up on happiness omin my life. 

I struggled with depression and anxiety for quite some years now. It comes and goes in waves but gets severely triggert by my extrem fear of abandonment.

...I suffered from a breakup a few months ago, tried to start a new life in a new city. 
All while doing not good at all but for the first time in my life I pushed myself through all of it..so I thought. I managed to get a new job and even got on ""friend dates"" to find new people in the town I know nobody. 

But I am exhausted. I'm more than exhausted. I manage to go to work, but then I come home and I'm not able to do anything. My dishes are nearly all used up and I can't get myself to clean them because I'm just tired. Same with the clothes..or the boxes from my move. I feel overwhelmed and jeut empty inside. I am on my phone 24/7 when I'm home to keep me distracted else I lie on the floor and cry or sleep.

I know I should go outside or meet people, talk to my friends from home, and I tried but it doesn't seem to help. I mean my friends don't know what to say to me and going out on my own gives me anxiety and and exhausts me even more as nothing brings real joy.

I am afraid that it will soon take over my whole life again that I won't be able to do anything and then loose my job and my home and everything. I just can't do this again..

I feel alone and just empty or sad or I don't know, nothingness? And on the same time I feel pathetic and cringe, as I know people have it so much worse and I am here whining about nothing.

I might have a problem with procrastinating,2,1.0,"Pretty much the title.

Usually, I believe a lot of people procrastinate, and I was the same, like pushing homework, etc... to the last minute, not wanting to train right away, etc...

That was until a year or two, where It has reached a level where I started even procrastinating eating. My weight right now is 57KG (I'm 180cm tall, male, and 20 years old).

The problem is that I don't know if it is because of the procrastination or the low weight, but I started lacking any sort of excitement in the things I do. Such as gaming, writing, etc... and I generally do not feel excitement for anything majority of the time. I used to think I enjoyed playing games and stuff, but as I look more into it, I realized that I'm just convincing myself that I enjoy what I'm doing, but in reality, I do it as a way to just pass time or think that I'm enjoying it. 

The only times where I genuinely enjoyed what I was doing was when I take Lyrica/Pregablin, where I feel a sense of excitement in all the things I used to do, and I have energy to do anything that I want. 

I do not know if I have depression, adhd, etc..., and I can't really check of either of these things since there aren't any psychatrists/psychologists/etc... where I live (The idea of mental illnesses and stuff are heavily frowned upon where I live, and people don't really believe in them that much here)

Am I in the wrong? ,2,1.0,"I needing some help and insight. I go to beauty school with girls between the ages of 17-40. I have a really hard time having patience especially with these girls that act like they are still in middle school. This week, I am trying really hard to have more patience and have a more positive energy. This morning we were doing a test review where we find the answer and then race to see which team can write it on the whiteboard first. This in general causes a lot of anxiety l for me. It’s really over stimming and it just feels like nobody is paying attention. When doing any type of test review, I highlight the answers in my textbook so I have better recall. We were asked (by our instructor) to not find the answers in the textbook before answering the question so we could have been recall. I was opening my book to highlight the answer (after it had been answered) and then shutting it for the next question. Some of the girls on the other team were getting on my case for opening it at all and then the instructor told me just to highlight afterwards so I closed my book and that was that. I could feel my anxiety rising so I left the room to try and gain my composure before coming back. When I left, I shut the door much more aggressively than what I wanted to and then I came back and that was fine. Afterwards, my instructor asked if I could talk to her in the office and so I went and she told me that she is going to give me the day off and send me home. Being on the verge of tears, I said okay, got my stuff and clocked out for the day. Before this point I was okay, had gained my composure, went back to the class and continued to participate. It was only after we had talked that my anxiety got super bad. I went out to my car and had a good cry for a few minutes and then I went back in with the intention of just apologizing to the instructor. When I walked back in, the head instructor saw that I was crying and asked what was wrong and if I could talk in her office. I said yes and went in and told her what happened. At this point I was hyperventilating and struggling to breathe. She told me that she understood where the other instructor was coming from and that I should talk to her to feel better and then go home. I went outside to catch my breath and hopefully calm down about the entire situation. Then another instructor pulled up so she could come inside and work. She asked me what was wrong and included that I have been working on being more patient this week and it just sucks that even when I’m trying, I just end up feeling like it was worse that before, and I told her and she said she would talk to the head instructor. I went in and apologized to the first instructor and told the head instructor I was going home. Now I’m out in my car crying again but I really am going home this time. 

Am I in the wrong for telling the other instructor who is now going to talk to the head instructor? I don’t want her to feel like I’m just going over her head and talking to someone else so they can make it better. 

Am I in the wrong at all? I feel like what I did was appropriate especially since I walked away from the initial problem that was causing anxiety and frustration. 

I would just really appreciate any input you might have for me.

Struggling with homicidal thoughts,3,1.0,"This is a lot so I'll only vaguely sum up everything. I've had homicidal thoughts since I was maybe 11-12, I'm 20 now. They come and go whenever they want, even in inappropriate situations. My problem is that for the most part they are unwanted, but sometimes I like them and that bothers me. I think I'm usually a good person, at least I try my best to be but even though they are just thoughts it makes me feel like an awful person for thinking about such things about people who I'm acquainted to. I had a weird upbringing, my dad left me and I moved a lot, always the new kid and struggled to find friends. I wouldn't considered myself an introvert but I enjoy my company and have only 1-2 good friends at a time. My mom remarried and I had a step dad with drinking issues and he used to beat me when he got angry. I'm just putting it in for context because maybe this has something to do with it. When the thoughts started I did hurt small reptiles and animals, but when they died I did still feel empathy and sometimes even cried. Now this is the reason why I'm writing this, I'm confused why I feel these strong thoughts of homicide and still feel empathy in some situations. Especially towards animals. Sometimes those thoughts make me feel amazing and powerful but other times in other situations it's the complete opposite and I'm conflicted. I personally think I have some capacity of empathy but let's say for a example situation like if someone had a car a car accident and started screaming and crying. I find it annoying and wish they'd shut the fuck up. I just hope someone here and give me some insight on what or why this could be happening. I don't want to talk to a therapist either because I'm afraid of going to an institution and to some degree I feel ashamed to tell anyone because I don't want to ruin the image they have of me.

Self therapy guided help,1,1.0,"Hi everyone! I’ve been trying to work on my mental health recently. I’m looking for a therapist actively and have reached out to several through my insurance. 

For context, I’ve been struggling with depression, grief, guilt, worry (not necessarily anxiety). It’s not awful day-to-day, but I definitely need help.

However, in the meantime while I wait to connect with a therapist, I am trying to find some sort of guided self-help therapy. There are a million articles online about self-care, journaling, etc. but I want something that has daily prompts to journal about, or a specific thing to do that day to work on my mental health. Made by professionals, not self-help gurus. Not shallow stuff but like an actual guided process to get a start on healing. (And would overlap with actual therapy in a couple weeks.) 

Does that make sense at all? Does this exist? Or even like a YouTube channel with frequent (wouldn’t have to be daily) videos that are actually beneficial for mental health.

I would prefer in-person over telehealth, but that’s been an issue for me finding someone, because so many therapists only do virtual sessions.

Occasional dejavu feeling,1,1.0,"Hi everyone, I just had a question regarding this odd feeling I get every couple of weeks.

Some context, I have had a rough go at early adulthood. Alcoholism took over my life, and made my life unmanageable. Had terrible relationships with people that hurt me dearly, homelessness for a time, losing good jobs to alcohol, this list can go on for a while… It was a rather dark time dealing with the lows.  Luckily, I have been two years sober and have taken control of my life again.
Found a career based job, and quickly rose up the ranks to middle management making the more money than I thought I could without further education. I have a stable living situation, and can treat myself to nice things/experiences (which is new to me).

The odd feeling that I get sometimes is that everything will come crashing down. Like I’ve had a dream about it, or have a dejavu moment where I “know” something terrible is coming. Whether that be losing this job, an accident happening, or something worse. 
Almost like I shouldn’t get too comfortable, and it’ll put me on edge. Usually takes a day or two to shake the feeling.

My question is two parts. Is this something related to mental illness? Navigating sobriety has left me feeling as though I forgot what “normal” is. Should this be something I pursue in therapy, or will it go away after a time?

I know mom loves me and I love her too but I can't get over the past.What do I do?,1,1.0,"When I was little(10-11 y/o)my mom used to hit me.And well is was not just a slap on the cheek.It was a full beating with stick and everything.It so often that I thought it was normal and all kids go through that which I am realising is not the case as I am growing up.
There are 2 instances in particular
I)We had just come back home after attending the PTM after I got my 4th( maybe 3rd not quite sure)grade report card and I hadn't performed well.My parents were disappointed.I remember running away from my mom who running after me with the stick hitting me every chance she got.I ended up going to the balcony but then I was cornered I had nowhere to hide.I remember I was there at the corner of the balcony sitting down and trying to protect myself with my hands and apologizing for my poor performance while my mother continued to hit me.
And the second time was even worse so I am not gonna talk about it.

But as I grew up we became closer and now we are closer than ever.We haven't discussed about any of that cause I thought that it was normal and every kid goes through the same.But now that I am away from home and was able to connect to more people I realised that it isn't normal.
Now I hate when anyone even touches me on my bare skin even though by mistake.I always wipe that are with my other hand or tissue.It is so bad that sometimes I feel like I am gonna end up crying when that happens.
I know what I went through is not the worst so I keep telling myself that it happened like like 10 years ago and I need to get over it.But I just can't seem to do that.
There are time when all those memories flashes across my mind and I end up have a meltdown.This is one of those moments.

But that’s it. I don’t know what to do next. So I’m just stuck with my thoughts and usually fear and anxiety.

Struggling with Mental Health and Weight Loss for Years—Looking for Advice and Support,1,1.0,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out here because I'm really struggling and don't know where else to turn. For many years, I've been battling with my weight and my mental health. The constant bullying I’ve faced, including from my husband's family, has been relentless. Though they had stopped for a while, the hurtful comments have started again recently, and it’s crushing me.

I was diagnosed with severe ADHD, which makes everything harder. My ADHD impacts my ability to stay focused and consistent with my weight loss efforts. I can’t seem to stick to a diet or exercise routine long enough to see real progress. It feels like I’m at the end of my rope, and I honestly don’t know what to do.

I’ve been seriously considering a gastric sleeve surgery as a possible solution. However, my husband is very against it. He thinks I’m choosing the easy way out and insists that I should focus more on my eating habits and exercise. Trust me, I’ve tried. I’ve tried everything—different diets, workout plans, even medication—but nothing sticks because I can’t maintain my focus and motivation.

This constant struggle is affecting every aspect of my life. It’s taking a toll on my self-esteem and how I feel about myself. I’m 5’3” and 90kg, and every day feels like a battle against my own body and mind. I feel judged and uncomfortable around people, and it’s exhausting.

People treat us fat girls very differently. It feels like we don’t belong anywhere. Trust me, I’m not a pro-body positivity advocate. I don’t believe that being overweight is something to be proud of because it’s not healthy. It impacts your sexual life, your day-to-day activities, and overall well-being.

But above all, it’s the bullying that’s killing me. The looks, the words, and the endless comments directed at my husband, who is very fit—""You can do better."" These words cut deep and reinforce the feeling that I’m not good enough. They make me question my worth and my place in my own relationship.

I feel trapped. On one hand, I want to make a change for my health and well-being. On the other, I don’t want to go against my husband’s wishes. Would I be wrong to go ahead with the surgery despite his opposition? I’m desperate for a solution that will help me regain control over my life and health.

I’m really at a loss here. I want to be healthy, not just physically but mentally too. I need to find a solution that works for me, but I feel so trapped and overwhelmed. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope or find a way forward? Any advice, experiences, or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

I had a weed-induced psychosis last night. Why did I go through that TERRIFYING experience?,3,0.66,"I have never tried any cannabis in my life. Rarely drink. No history of mental illness as I know it. But I had 1-3mg of a weed rope gummie last night in the presence of friends -- a tiny piece! -- and two hours in, after a weird kind of relaxing high and slight headache, I started to lose my mind.

I stumbled to the bathroom in a daze. Came back and absolutely nothing felt real. I felt like I was both asleep and awake, alive and dead, stuck in my body. I was extremely paranoid if this current moment was real and I was panicking if this feeling would ever stop.

I remember asking my friends incessant questions and them calming me down. Taking a cold shower. Throwing up, asking them to take me to the ER. Being in the hospital and sleeping it off.

I cannot explain to you the dread, panic, terror, and paranoia I felt. I never, ever want to experience that again, and just remembering the moment makes my stomach churn and take me back to that place.

WTF did that happen? The one thing I am so incredibly, deeply grateful for is that it happened with my friends, who I trust. The thing that grounded me over and over is that my friends are kind, they wouldn't fool me, I trust their judgement, this is reality. But it's like remembering that love was my last tether to reality.

Am I screwed if I missed out on close childhood friendship and other youthful things?,1,1.0,"I'm 23M. Long story short, I had a best friend when I was in early childhood and honestly that was the best part of my life. But then he moved away and although I had some friends after, none really ever came close to him. I just felt so loved and special around him, but he moved away so soon.

I experienced some neglect too. There were times in my life where the only peers my age I got to see were like once a week on Sundays for 3 hours at most. It really sucked.

I wish I could've gone to sports. I wish I could've seen other kids my age every day like the public schoolers got to do. I wish we had more money to do fun stuff with my friends. I wish I got to have a big birthday party with my best friend and a bunch of other people. I wish I could've gone to prom. I wish I could've had a sleepover (with close friends that actually liked me). I wish I could've seen my friends every day in summer and did summer stuff, even if it was just one friend.

I was such a lonely child. This probably sounds pathetic but in middle school I used to pretend I had a little brother and he'd sit with me in the car and talk and we'd cuddle.

Why do I always have to be alone? Why do the people closest to me always have to go? I don't mind having responsibilities or do adult things but all my friends wanna get married, but I'm not ready to move to that stage of life.

"I did something stupid and I could use ""there there"" ",5,1.0,"I'll keep this short. I have the diagnoses of cPTSD, autism and chronic depression. I've battled with alcohol/weed addiction all my adult life because my brain wouldn't shut up. Nowadays I have good medication to help with that. But this week I did something stupid.

My doctor has just changed my dosage of bupropion/wellbutrin from 150mg to 300mg. That has been going amazingly well. I was doing so well that I thought it's okay if I smoke a little bit of weed on Sunday night. But then, old habits, I kept smoking all day until Monday night when I realized that this is a bad decision. Tuesday was spent in physical exhaustion from weed withdrawal. Wednesday I had a date. Since I was feeling okay, I shared a bottle of wine with my date. The date went really badly actually. So I was spiraling at night, which is when I took a diazepam to calm down... while tipsy from the wine and while also recently on bupropion 300mg, yes. And the next morning, Thursday, I wake up in a heavy depression, way more than the failed date would call for. I forced myself to go out with a friend and have two more heavy drinks to calm myself down, and then I'm still in a bad mood. Late at night I realized that my medications already had a warning for alcohol use and being used together should be with caution, not while tipsy, and having used weed in the same week (which gives me mood swings)... So I basically induced a heavy and sharp depression on myself.

I know I fucked up. I'm feeling a bit better today (Friday) and decided to not have even a little bit of light beer for a couple of weeks to stabilize again. Can anyone relate to making such mistakes? Could I get a digital hug? 

Please don't judge me too harshly if you are the judgmental type. This weakness is part of my disorders and my autism doesn't help with remembering crucial health details or interoception.

"Just very confused, tips, advice, stories, thoughts",1,1.0,"Hi so, at the start of my journey to improve my mental health first it was depression and anxiety. Then it was also adhd and pmdd on top of that. Then it was bpd that was the biggest factor. And now my NP thinks my main issue is just that I am mentally exhausted so any type of stress is hard for me to handle. I do agree to the fact that I am mentally exhausted but I don't want to believe thats the only thing thats wrong with me. Mainly because I don't know it makes me feel like everything I have dealt with for the last 10 years is almost my fault for just trying to do too much. But also the only solution to fixing mental exhaustion (if thats the only thing I have) is to give myself more time to rest and not be stressed. Unfortunately I am in a situation where I am doing the least amount of things possible which is still a lot. I have to do all this stuff because I need money to survive (I barely get by with my current paychecks) and I have to go back to school to get a different degree or I am screwed.

But at the same time, none of the meds i have taken have made any significant difference and I have tried many. Also none of the therapy that I have tried has helped me either.

I don’t know whether I need to be tested further medically? Can someone clear this up?,1,1.0,"So I, 16M from the UK have been struggling immensely from anxiety/stress for the past 8 weeks. Have always been a ‘worrier’, but have only now been diagnosed and put on medication.

About 4 weeks into this hellish experience, I began to feel the very familiar feeling of dissociation. Although I haven’t experienced this in a long while, I have had rather scary episodes of it in the past. However, these experiences were when I was younger, and it was more ‘derealisation’. But, as a now older, more aware person, these feelings are far scarier.

I’ll try and keep it brief. Whats scaring me, is i constantly feel confused. About the time, the place im in, what im doing. All of it. It’s like a constant detachment from any sense of reality (I know how in describing it sounds exactly like dpdr, but it feels ‘different’). But everytime it comes to these feelings of confusion, i’m able to tell myself ‘you’re at home, the time is so and so’. But it’s like I didn’t know that, and that information just ‘appeared’ by miracle. I’m sorry that this is so vague, but can someone please tell me that these very strange symptoms are normal?

No hopes left,1,1.0,"15M, since my childhood I have always been soo lonely.
met so many ppl but got no one whom I call 'best-friend' or 'partner'.
It's not like I don't try to communicate with anyone, but whenever I do I can sense that they are not interested. Everyone have got their *groups/friends*, I feel that I am just bothering them.
Everyone comes to me whenever they're at their lowest, and I try my best to make them feel good.
I have got soo many compliments saying that ""you're my therapist"", ""you got some type of healer vibe"" I just respond with a smile.
But no one is there for me whenever I need to express my sadness.

All this incidents made me the type of a introverted person I'm rn. 
Now I don't even try to talk to anyone, always overthink everything and keeps everything deep inside my heart.

Sometimes I do feel a need of intimacy, maybe this is the reason that I start to share my 'life-experiences' with someone who shows even just a slight of interest in talking to me.
But all of them are just two-faced ppl who's just jealous of me.

I'm pretty good in my academics, everyone approach me when the exams are near (just too know abt my preps).

Coffee and music is something which actually make me feel good.

A predator relative ruined the way I see things and I have no clue what to do.,8,1.0,"I posted this a while ago and it got absolutely 0 replies or advice. So I simply tried forgetting. Recently though, something reminded me of this, and I'm starting all the progress of forgetting over from the start again. Also, for context, I'm a dude, which may be important but may not be? I don't really know.

So i'm not really going to elaborate, but let's just say my cousin did some very bad shit to my sister. I never knew anything happened or was happening, and the whole time we were just totally fine. I never even knew. Until I knew. The man is a monster.  

Fast forward to after all this was revealed to me, a ton of stuff is totally tainted now and it's making me super sad. I used to love rebuilding computers, but ever since I found out about what he did and that he did that too, it just reminds me of him. I used to love playing multi-player games with him since he was good at only some of them and I was good at most of them so I'd usually beat him (I admit I did take advantage of that). 

A few days ago (a few MONTHS ago, this is old but applies) I was playing an online game and thought about the times i played it with him, and then thought about what he did, and then remembered that he made me sit on his lap while playing and that train of thoughts was so disturbing I literally froze while playing the game while online. It must have been 5 minutes or so of me just sitting there listening to Team Fortress noises blasting in the background having some sort of terrible mental event until I finally sort of ""snapped back"" and just shut the computer off and went to bed. I havent opened it since out of fear of being reminded of him. I feel bad for my teammates, because I'm sure I probably made them lose.  

Even my college planning is getting screwed up. My current choice of college is a community College, and since I'm kinda dumb and also kinda poor, it's the only option I have. Fine school, but it reminds me of him. I'm genuinely not sure how to handle possible taking classes in a school he went to. I even remember visiting him once. I'm considering crossing it off my list. (Even months later this is still true, but sadly it's like the only college I can get in in range of me that isn't either extremely suspicious, online, or a trade school.)

Hell, now that it's been a few months since I wrote some of this I notice that even my *laugh* sometimes reminds me of him. Now I want to reprogram my throat so I can stop thinking of that vile monster when I start laughing. Thank God me and the rest of my family have a restraining order on him, but he's *STILL* fucking with me.

insecurity causing mental health problems affecting quality of life ,1,1.0,"
I've struggled with insecurities about the size my nose my whole life. My nose covers a huge portion of my face and  It's something that affects every part of who I am and how I live. Because of it, I've missed out on so many experiences, hiding away from public events and basically living inside.

I can still remember the first time I felt ashamed of my nose. I was in middle school when some classmates made fun of its size. Their laughter cut deep, and ever since, I've been self-conscious. I avoid mirrors and feel a pang of pain whenever I see my reflection. It feels like I can’t escape the feeling that everyone is staring and judging me for something I can't change.

Over the years, this insecurity has taken a serious toll on my mental health. My nose has been the main cause of my anxiety and depression. Social situations have become a source of immense stress, and I find myself avoiding them whenever possible. I’ve missed out on so many important moments, making excuses not to go to parties or even family gatherings. I skipped my own graduation because I couldn’t bear the thought of standing in front of everyone. Instead of living my life, I've spent so much time hiding away, scared to be seen.

But I don’t want to live like this anymore. I want to be able to go out and enjoy life, to take photos with friends and family without worrying about my nose. I dream of the day I can walk into a room and not be judged 

I've looked into rhinoplasty, a surgery that could help me overcome this insecurity. However, the cost is beyond what I can afford. It’s gotten to a point where I feel like I just can’t bare the pain anymore I just can’t keep living like this.

"I destroyed my friendship with my best friend, relapsed, and then made everything in my life a thousand times worse.",13,0.94," ~~ I posted this in another subreddit, but figured I could maybe use some kind words or hope if you have any to spare. I’m out of them myself. I’ll finish the post in edits due to length. ~~

I’ve been an addict of some sort since I was 15 years old. It started with little white lies and leading a double life out of fear of coming out as trans, evolving into alcohol to cope as a young adult. By the time I finished college, I was taking and abusing pills and meth on a semi-regular basis, and I was a full-blown opioid addict by the time I was 26.

Eventually, I sobered up, started AA, and turned my life around, hitting a year of sobriety. Throughout all of it, one of my best friends, Kyle (name has been changed) stood by my side. For context, I had previously developed romantic feelings for Kyle and was shot down in the kindest of ways, and over time we got closer and closer and became as close of friends as friends could be. My feelings for him never faded, but I just kept them to myself, always respecting his boundaries and never wanting to ruin what we had.

A few weeks ago, I started struggling with my sobriety. I felt the joy of my day to day life starting to slip through my fingers, and the pressure of recovery was becoming too much to handle. But because my life was going “so great”, I started having to look for reasons to justify relapsing; at least, that’s my theory for why I did what happens next.

One night, I invited Kyle over to my house to watch a movie and hang out. The entire time we’re together, I only had two thoughts going through my head: that I was in love with him, and that I wanted to get high more than anything in the world. I’ll spare all of the boring details of us hanging out, but as he was leaving and I hugged him goodbye, I did the very thing I was determined never to do and I kissed him, crossing that boundary. He texted me the next day that he wasn’t mad at me but that he needed time to build trust back in our friendship.

Later on, instead of taking responsibility and his feelings into account for the fact that I crossed the line and broke his trust, I doubled down. I became needy and obsessive. I posted online about how heartbroken and in love I was. I wrote poetry about him and sent it to him. I hounded him with confessions of my feelings. I treated him like an object. Deep down, I knew that I either needed him to fix me or I needed him to hurt me enough to break me.

And then it happened. After a few days of silence, he texted me and told me how everything I did and was doing made him feel and that he didn’t want me to reply or speak to him. I did what I sought out to do and I lost my best friend. Everything inside of me shattered. And that night, I wiped and deleted all of my social media, turned off my phone’s texting, drove into the city, and relapsed in a parking lot in my car.

It all happened so fast it was like a blur. Every ounce of pain and regret and sorrow and fear I had been pushing down the last year instead of actually facing in recovery came surging back up as I vomited out the back door of my car. The three minutes I was high . . . I don’t even remember them. I completely blacked out and woke up after hours of nodding off, realizing what I’d done. I drove home, got some sleep, went to an AA meeting, and left again to try and find a treatment center, only to be turned away at every step.

So here I am, exactly 8 days since the night I kissed Kyle. I’ve been using every day since that first night I relapsed. It took me a week and a day to lose my best friend, my sobriety, my job, my family’s trust, and probably a ton of other things I can’t even think of right now. I’m too scared to turn my texting back on. I’m too scared to download social media again. Right now . . . I exist in a bubble, isolated in the confines of my car. I doubt anyone is looking for me, but if they are, I truly don’t think I want to be found like this. Part of me wants to recover so badly and claw my way out of this so I can fix things with him. Another part of me wants to go on to the end of this because I deserve it.

But either way, no matter what happens, I feel so much regret for putting him through all of what I did. I made him a pawn in a game he never signed up for and I used him as a means to justify my own self-destruction. I want to make amends with him but I don’t even know where I would start. I wish I could take it all back. I wish he had never had to meet someone like me.

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, so I guess I just needed to confess my sins out loud while I still can. If you’re reading this and you’re struggling with addiction and thinking about getting help, please do. Recovery is a beautiful thing, and one of my deepest hopes is that it works for others better than it did for me.

If you made it to the end, thank you for reading. I hope you don’t judge me too harshly, but I understand if you do. I don’t deserve sympathy. But if you have any to spare, I could really use some kind words. I have none left of my own.

Working and my mental health have never been friends,1,1.0,"Struggled with mental health for a very long time. I distinctly remember the 1st time I considered giving up in a permanent way when I was in 9th grade. Every few months or years from that point forward, I’ve had mental ‘collapses’. I am now almost 27 and struggling once again. I have had many jobs that ended in disaster because of my mental health. The full time jobs always took me out within a few months, the part time jobs I’ve had were more manageable long term and I had surpassed 1 years at my last part time job. The passion for the jobs was never there, they did not reflect my passions, they were just jobs. 

Fast forward to now, I’ve been working full time in a role that is centered around topics I’m very passionate about. But full time work has a way of killing me slowly. For context, the job is working with animals but it’s not sunshine and rainbows. I have no work life balance, my role is underpaid with little support, on call for emergencies, and every single day is unpredictable. It’s been 3 months and I’ve had a few complete breakdowns, one that I did share with my superior. My superior helped the best they could but they cannot change me or how the role is performed. Only mentioned that they are there to support me in anyway they can. I am now reaching some kind of collapse in my mental health. I feel like I need a break so desperately that I cannot get. 

I’ve had many mental health crisis where I came close to creating a plan and following through. But I have never followed a plan with intent or attempted. Every time I’ve reached that point, it was somehow closely tied to my work and my inability to have a job and be a human that can care for themselves. 

I start to look at everything through a different lens, everything feels different and scary and I feel like ripping my skin off.My chest will hurt like my heart is broken. It’s never ending and I cannot get relief. By this point I’m usually actively thinking “I cannot do this anymore and I want to be done” I start thinking about su*c*de and it starts a painful process where I cannot think straight, I start to mourn my life in a way. The dread and guilt of not being able to push forward becomes unbearable. I’m reaching that point and my therapist can only do so much for me.I am talking with her, she just advised time away from work for now. 

I was on medication for years and did have these struggles whilst on meds. I recently (april 2024) was weaned off my ssri and the relief of side effects has been wonderful but I worry maybe taking them again is the only way to maybe get an ounce of sanity back. 

Does anyone else here deeply struggle with working full time?Or have a history similar to mine where full time work leads to emotional distress? I really need insight, advice, and/or support.

Validation,1,0.99,"You ever feel the need to be valued by everyone around you? The feeling to be heard, seen or not feel invisible? I have, sometimes growing up without your parents love and touch can either generate mental issues or make you seek validation from every single person who say’s hi. Have you ever felt like no one would take the time out to find out who you are so you shove it down their throats before they get to, then you go about your day regretting sharing so much?? Yeah I’ve been there too. Often times we don’t recognize we are doing it until we actually already screw up and then ask ourselves why!! Reminder today: YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL & HANDSOME… your parents actions, your ex best friend or ex bf/gf doesn’t have a say in how your life continues. Validation and love should be found in yourself today, tomorrow and forever because guess what?? No one can do it better than YOU! You are amazing all by yourself, and someone adding themselves in your life should just be either the desert or side salad. Don’t let anything past related or present related affect anything about yourself, if you are struggling mentally just remember everyone do and you’re not going to face it alone, CRY! But don’t sit crying for the rest of your life, you’ll miss out on what’s next. I promise you! YOUR OPINION MATTERS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE’S!!!

Being in a relationship with a  narcissist (NPD). I have BPD. ,2,1.0,"It all started beautifully, like any relationship. We were madly in love with each other. He accepted me as I was, diagnosed with ADHD, BPD, depression and others. He took care to bring me the medicines, to take them on time, and even arranged them by day. We loved each other very much. He accepted that I was trying to change (going to therapy and taking medication) and it seemed to make all my problems go away. I mention that at first I didn't know he had NPD. I idealized him, he was everything to me.

Until it started to change. He became nervous at every word I said. currently, I'm afraid to talk to him about anything for fear he'll get upset. It started to control my life. He knows what time I sleep (we only sleep with the video camera on, we don't live together), he knows when I wake up, what I eat, who I talk to, what I do all day, when I go to the gym, when I study, he looks at my phone. If I forget to do something, the hate attacks appear. He shouts, bangs his head against the walls, foams at the mouth (I'm not kidding) and blames only me. I have quiet BPD, I never argue, I am very calm and I try to stay that way in the situations mentioned above.

He gets upset if I talk to my family or friends because I don't give him enough attention.
He always tells me that everything is about me and that he doesn't feel that I love him. Although I do everything for him... Many times, after arguments, he threatened me to take his own life. I ended up calling his mom to call him because I didn't know what happened to him or what he was going to do.

I love him with all my heart, but I know that this is not what a relationship should look like. I feel it's not right. However, I can't let him go, no matter how bad it is, I'm afraid to be alone. No one has understood me as well as he does. However, it destroys me inside and out; one day, he also slapped me during an argument.

Can trauma cause mood disorder?,1,1.0,"After I hit puberty my autism symptoms got significantly more intense and I couldn’t handle school anymore, but I couldn’t get out of school fast enough because I needed a diagnosis, which took the entire year to get. 

Then covid hit and that’s what got me out when I was at the end of my line. The following years were maddening. I would have a month where I felt fine, but then one where I wanted to claw the bones out of my skin. I would have nights where I wanted to do anything and everything nobody would ever reasonably do, I.e. run into the desert, chop off my arm, blow a ton of money on something I didn’t want. 

There were days where I was ecstatic, thinking I had recovered, nights where I felt overwhelming comfort after wanting to end it due to unreasonable guilt. 

I would fixate on things, like mind reading and how horrible of a person I thought I was. Or how I thought I was being spied on or that I was going to die under any and every circumstance. There would be months where time didn’t move correctly, and months where I wasn’t sure if I existed. 

I would get so scared and angry for dozens of weeks and then it would just stop. I didn’t even notice that something was happening that wasn’t in my control. 

I had hallucinations daily and then they just went away. I don’t even know how I overlooked that? Visual hallucinations usually were of animals and audio hallucinations were usually of screaming or my cat meowing.

I think I only noticed once I was put on antidepressants that made me think more clearly and remember things better. And when I started having a ton of physical symptoms all at the same time I realized it was weird that I seemed to change a lot.

Feeling Used and Moving On from a One-Sided Friendship,1,1.0,"I recently ended a friendship with someone I deeply cared about and supported through their toughest times. Over the past few months, I noticed she started ignoring me and lying about her plans. When I confronted her, she gaslighted me, making it seem like it was my fault.

Despite my efforts to maintain the friendship, including giving her money during my financial struggles, she continually avoided making plans with me and often left me waiting without explanation. When I found out she lied about a dinner plan to go out with other friends, it hurt deeply.

After a confrontation that turned into a fight, I decided to apologize to end things on a good note, even though I wasn't at fault. I deleted her number, chats, and photos to move on, but I'm struggling with the urge to reach out again and seek her validation. It’s been a challenging emotional journey, and I’m dealing with feelings of guilt, sadness, and anxiety.

I realize now that I developed some romantic feelings for her, which weren’t reciprocated. I’m trying to move forward, but it’s difficult.

The Silent Toll of political dynamics on mental health🧠,2,1.0,"In today’s fast-paced world, the intersection of politics and mental health is becoming increasingly evident. From polarized debates to policy changes, the political landscape profoundly impacts our collective well-being. Here are some insights into how this dynamic plays out:

	1.	Stress and Anxiety: Continuous exposure to political news can heighten stress and anxiety levels. The 24/7 news cycle and social media amplify political conflicts, making it hard to escape the tension.
	2.	Social Division: Political polarization can strain personal relationships. Families and friends find themselves at odds, leading to feelings of isolation and frustration. The sense of community is often eroded, affecting mental health.
	3.	Policy Impact: Government policies directly influence access to mental health services. Funding cuts or restrictive laws can limit the availability of essential care, exacerbating mental health issues.
	4.	Public Discourse: The tone of political discourse can impact societal mental health. Negative rhetoric, misinformation, and hostility contribute to a pervasive sense of unease and helplessness.
	5.	Civic Engagement: Conversely, political involvement can be empowering. Advocacy and participation in community efforts can foster a sense of purpose and belonging, countering feelings of despair.

Moving Forward

Recognizing these impacts is the first step toward mitigating them. Here are some actionable steps:

📌Limit Exposure: Be mindful of your media consumption. Regular digital detoxes can help manage anxiety.
📌Seek Support: Engage in open conversations with trusted individuals. Support networks are crucial during politically charged times.
📌Advocate for Change: Support policies and leaders that prioritize mental health. Collective action can lead to systemic improvements.

As we navigate these challenging times, it’s vital to stay informed without compromising our mental well-being. Let’s advocate for a healthier discourse and policies that support mental health for all.

Why am I always cynical and in a bad mood? ,1,1.0,"
To preface this I have autism:


My entire life i've been cynical and in a bad mood, anyone else like this?

All my life i've been cynical of doing things or going places, most trips to... anything? as a child ended with me crying, being hurt, getting sick or getting bored. Most family gatherings aren't that far off.

I've had a most loving family where im the golden child where everyone takes care of me, even my sibblings treat me more like a son than a brother, so im not sure why im like this.

Each time i try to change my routine i end up not liking it or being bothered in some way, the small things pile up, i fuck up my foot, my nose gets stuffy, etc. maybe thats why i dont like going to concerts, parties, clubs, whatever.

I don't know how to articulate this very well, but i feel like i'm perenially rolling my eyes.

I've had happy moments in my life but they were all very inactive and it seems the more active i am the worse of a mood i am.

I've attempted many times to get out of my comfort zone, worked out, met as many people as I could, went out to as many things as I could, traveled, but not only did I not want to, I don't look back on any of it fondly, even after all the progress I made I don't feel bad rotting inside at all and spend weeks doing so and I'm always so much happier.

Sometimes I wish I drank alcohol or did drugs,1,0.67,"It seems like so many mentally ill, depressed, or just outright stressed people around me easily fall to the vice of alcohol and drugs. Like whenever they've got something wrong they just drink away their problems, smoke, trip, etc. 

Despite the downsides of drugs, I've always felt envious of people's ability to have some sort of instant vice or coping mechanism. I am young yet even the people around me of similar age with lack of mental illness have fallen into it just from the stress of day to day life. 

It feels like cultural peer pressure. I get the ""well actually alcohol has been apart of society forever so it's normal and okay!"" Well, so has prejudice and hatred but that doesn't make it good. 

I've always gotten the ""how do you enjoy life without it?"" and ""I guess you don't like having fun?"" lines and I've got to say I'm envious of people who get to have fun or sedate themselves that way, even if in short bursts. I'm literally the only person in my immediate and extended family to never ""get fucked up"" on drugs and I'm envious despite the massive amount of problems they've had due to it.

Advice on how to figure out what the people close to me can do to help,1,1.0,"For context I'm Bipolar with ADHD, up until very recently my coping mechanism was to isolate and just wallow in in depression until it either passed or I figured things out. As you may expect that hasn't been going very well for me. 

I've made a lot of big changes in my life recently and in an effort to better myself I decided to start opening up to my family about how I feel and the struggles I face with my BP and ADHD as well as informing them about how ADHD is something that affects me in my everyday life.

 I realised that it's been over 8 years since I was diagnosed and they were completely unaware of how ADHD affects people and what it entails. They were a little more familiar with Bipolar although they understood it to mean that you have episodes of mania (they thought it was ""happiness"") and depression. However they didn't know what those episodes entail, like what happens during those episodes or how you act differently and the subtleties of it. I decided to fill them in as best as I could. I found articles online and compiled a little info packet which had info taken from the articles as well as my own personal input and gave it to them to read through. I also wrote them a letter explaining how I was feeling and what thoughts had been occupying my mind and making me anxious, stressed out or just making me feel more depressed. I then set down with them and talked through everything. 

They were really supportive for the most part, they did push back a bit on the executive disfunction and for example said that they can understand it but there's certain things where  I should ""make more effort"" and ""prioritise"". I explained to them that it's not a case of me not trying, that I do put in effort and try to prioritise but that I struggle and that sometimes it's out of my control. I told them that I would start looking into ways to manage my ADHD better so that I can handle things in a healthier way and so that the Executive disfunction becomes a  bit more manageable and hopefully wont affect me as much. Thankfully they came to accept and understand what I was saying and the final question they had for me was what could they do to help? 

This is where the problem comes in. I have no idea what I need to help me. I've never had healthy or good coping mechanisms. Like I said in the start of the post I'd just isolate until it passed by. I have no idea what I need to help myself let alone what others can do to help me.

I’ve been waiting years to look at diagnosis only to be denied again. ,1,1.0,"When I was younger I was constantly told ‘we don’t diagnose under 18s!’ And only given the bog standard talk therapy and antidepressants as a result and they have never even made a dent in my issues. I’ve had friends, family, myself and even some professionals suspect / mention or agree that it sound like I have PTSD and / or BPD. 

I’ve waited years to turn 18 and I finally have and I just got a new psychologist with the adult mental health system and suddenly they ‘don’t diagnose often anymore’ and ‘prefer to treat the symptoms rather than the condition’ which is so disheartening and also sounds like a load of bullshit that won’t work. It feels like I’m only going to be given the same bog standard treatment that wont work. 

My psychologist also keeps saying things like “that’s PTSD” “that sounds like PTSD” “this is used to treat PTSD” then follows it up with “I don’t think you have a disorder” when those are extremely conflicting. 

I want a diagnosis for multiple reasons, a big one being is actually have a name or maybe two for all my symptoms instead of just listing ALL my symptoms to every single professional I talk to each time. And another is I actually want more personal and specialised treatment because the general treatment just does not work.

Help with understanding what is causing the angry behavior? ,1,1.0,"Hello,

I have a long time friend who's behavior is very strange considering that he is in the range of 30-40 years old and not a teenager. Many times when a disagreement starts his body language suggests that he is getting nervous very fast, as in just seconds. In those situations he cannot have a normal conversation, but behaves like subconsciously projecting his thoughts of ""how dare you not agreeing with me?!"" or ""how dare you interrupt me"", as if I can know when exactly he has finished talking (he makes small pauses, as if finished talking, so I start talking and he behaves, as if I intentionally interrupted him which is not the case at all).

He is constantly swearing and getting angry about the most stupid and childish things like not having internet connection while being at a beautiful beach or a mountain, or having some simple issue with electronics like connecting his phone to the computer or not being able to upload pictures to social media etc.

If there is something that isn't working or isn't perfect he won't miss the opportunity to complain and/or get angry about it.

The weirdest thing is that he has this issue for years and it happens in exactly the same way while on a **vacation** in a very beautiful country. His mental condition is exactly the same if he is on a summer vacation or in his hometown on an average day.

What I don't understand is what is the underlying cause of all of this. I know that some people are getting angry or annoyed faster than others, but from all the people I know no one would start swearing for not having internet connection or failing to upload photos online... Or say that he wants to destroy everything.

Another issue is that he is the true definition of hater. His romantic life is non existent. He hates everything, but most of all he hates women while also being straight\*\*.\*\* He is constantly talking negatively about them and thinks they are all the same. He never forgets to mention it while being with his male friend(s). He doesn't have much friends, as he mostly mentions just a couple of them.

He hates when it's too hot outside, when he needs to wait for transport, when there is a queue somewhere etc. He doesn't have the capability of not complaining about everything and everyone. He doesn't have much patience for anything.

Generally one would think that he is simply under a lot of stress, but he is **exercising daily** (fitness/football), so it's not like he is lacking stress relief activities. He is exercising a lot more than the average person. All this nervous energy must be coming from somewhere, yet he has always been like that - I know him since he was a kid. He definitely needs to start visiting a psychologist and I would probably tell him that in the coming months, but I am 99% certain that he had such suggestions from his relatives and ignores them. There is no way for them to miss such negative, toxic, hateful and worrying behavior.

I feel like he will completely lose his mind when he starts having health issues due to age/stress. If he cannot reduce his stress from exercising/traveling while young I don't see how he could possibly control his emotions and behavior at a later point in life. And he definitely has a ""fear of getting old"", as we have discussed how bad it can be while being old and having health issues.",mentalhealth,mentalhealth1989,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfo4gz/help_with_understanding_what_is_causing_the_angry/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13185979184521e-06,"['hello', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'behavior', 'strange', 'considering', 'range', 'year', 'old', 'teenager', 'many', 'time', 'disagreement', 'start', 'body', 'language', 'suggests', 'getting', 'nervous', 'fast', 'second', 'situation', 'normal', 'conversation', 'behaves', 'like', 'subconsciously', 'projecting', 'thought', 'dare', 'agreeing', 'dare', 'interrupt', 'know', 'exactly', 'finished', 'talking', 'make', 'small', 'pause', 'finished', 'talking', 'start', 'talking', 'behaves', 'intentionally', 'interrupted', 'case', 'constantly', 'swearing', 'getting', 'angry', 'stupid', 'childish', 'thing', 'like', 'internet', 'connection', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'mountain', 'simple', 'issue', 'electronics', 'like', 'connecting', 'phone', 'computer', 'able', 'upload', 'picture', 'social', 'medium', 'etc', 'something', 'working', 'perfect', 'wo', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'complain', 'get', 'angry', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'issue', 'year', 'happens', 'exactly', 'way', 'vacation', 'beautiful', 'country', 'mental', 'condition', 'exactly', 'summer', 'vacation', 'hometown', 'average', 'day', 'understand', 'underlying', 'cause', 'know', 'people', 'getting', 'angry', 'annoyed', 'faster', 'others', 'people', 'know', 'one', 'would', 'start', 'swearing', 'internet', 'connection', 'failing', 'upload', 'photo', 'online', 'say', 'want', 'destroy', 'everything', 'another', 'issue', 'true', 'definition', 'hater', 'romantic', 'life', 'non', 'existent', 'hate', 'everything', 'hate', 'woman', 'also', 'constantly', 'talking', 'negatively', 'think', 'never', 'forgets', 'mention', 'male', 'friend', 'much', 'friend', 'mostly', 'mention', 'couple', 'hate', 'hot', 'outside', 'need', 'wait', 'transport', 'queue', 'somewhere', 'etc', 'capability', 'complaining', 'everything', 'everyone', 'much', 'patience', 'anything', 'generally', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'simply', 'lot', 'stress', 'exercising', 'daily', 'like', 'lacking', 'stress', 'relief', 'activity', 'exercising', 'lot', 'average', 'person', 'nervous', 'energy', 'must', 'coming', 'somewhere', 'yet', 'always', 'like', 'know', 'since', 'kid', 'definitely', 'need', 'start', 'visiting', 'psychologist', 'would', 'probably', 'tell', 'coming', 'month', 'certain', 'suggestion', 'relative', 'ignores', 'way', 'miss', 'negative', 'toxic', 'hateful', 'worrying', 'behavior', 'feel', 'like', 'completely', 'lose', 'mind', 'start', 'health', 'issue', 'due', 'reduce', 'stress', 'young', 'see', 'could', 'possibly', 'control', 'emotion', 'behavior', 'later', 'point', 'life', 'definitely', 'fear', 'getting', 'old', 'discussed', 'bad', 'old', 'health', 'issue']","{'neg': 0.187, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': -0.9971}",negative

When will the feeling of guilt pass? ,1,1.0,"I don't want to go into details but I was recently involved in an accident where someone I didn't know to well got some injuries.

This happened days ago but I can't sleep and all I think about is how I fucked up and how much pain the person is going through.

I had just been through a particularly rough patch before this happened and I was beginning to feel optimistic again but now I can't think about having a happy life without feeling immense guilt and shame. I feel like I don't deserve that life while this poor girl is suffering. I feel like Its wrong to enjoy myself and see my friends, it's wrong for me to meet new people and form connections and how selfish it would be for me to even take care of myself.

I tried to be there for her as much as I can at the moment, I took her to the hospital and stayed with her until she was discharged 9 hours later and I took her home. But I feel like nothing I can do will make me feel less sick and ashamed until I know she can be happy. I'm trying to keep in touch and let her know that I've been thinking about her and wishing that she's resting and recovering. I've contacted her already and she said she doesn't blame me, but she's angry at the whole situation for happening. 

I'm scared that I'll always feel wrong or disgusted with myself if I ever decide to go out and try to have a good time because I feel like its not right for me to move past this while that girl is distressed and scared.

Why is my mind cursed (Vent),1,1.0,"Im a 18F with diagnosed ADHD,Autism and Anxiety I’m not good at detailing my thoughts but I’m gonna try. And apologies if I ramble 

I don’t know what’s wrong with my mind, ever sense I was a kid when I would be around people or pets I would smile, sometimes be a chatter box to the right people but alone I’m nothing, when I sit alone I feel all my emotions drain from my body and it’s like it takes energy to feel even the smallest amount. i can’t smile and I tend to look at my hands as a scroll on my phone realizing that I do nothing, I have no social life besides a few people but even then around them I feel empty and like if I died a couple weeks could go by and they would forget about me,  I also have these dark thoughts about death and the thought about killing myself. I ever the first time I thought about death was third grade and the first time I thought about killing musket was in the 4th grade.

 I always think that if I would just die things would get batter for my family cause they wouldn’t worry about my medical bills or the space I take up. In the 6th grade I held a knife to my heart like the scene in The Princess Bride but I would never do it, cause although I have these dark and decrement mind the idea of pain that  would put my body through is something I would gladly pass on, I  cut myself with a razor junior year but the pain was a lot so I never did it again. I have been dealt a bad hand and I’m just done, I don’t wanna tell my family and cause them stressed cause they work so hard to provide and my mother sacrificed so much for me and gave me things she never had, I don’t wanna go to a therapist because I don’t wanna get sent away, I hear the stories and people in my family got sent to them and changed negatively, I don’t wanna tell my friends because they got issues themselves and last time I told a friend about me trying to cut myself  and he didn’t say anything for a moment  and I believe he had a panic attack and hung up so I apologized and swore to never do it again and I’m supposed to be the reliant friend, I give because I can and cause I care  and expect nothing, 

I would never tell my girlfriend at all because I’m single currently and previously got cheated on and another time told I love to hard so they left, but if I was dating I would never tell cause I’m suppose to be the knight in shining armor who protects and loves.  And even if I could tell and decided to I’m horrible when it comes to explaining my feelings to others so I just don’t. Because why explain something when even you don’t even know. Because of this I feel indifferent from everyone, I stare at my family at gatherings realizing I never felt that sense of community or that sense of belonging even as young as 8 years old. I watch my friends at the lunch table and even at graduation engage with each other realizing that I just don’t feel that sense of support.

Is this abnormal? ,1,1.0,"* I’m a bad explainer*, Tried my best on this|  For basically all my life I’ve had constant paranoia. It feels like when I simply go down stairs for a snack alone, I have the simple thought there’s going to be a house intruder, I will see paranormal take place, or my biggest fear which is bugs, a bunch of them are just going to crawl everywhere. I sit in certain places because looking at some angles remind me of a monster standing in the doorway. If that makes any sense. I don’t even look in some directions of my house because it makes my skin crawl. It’s worse when I take a shower, the loud noise of the water, and not seeing very well behind the shower window disturbs me. All of this goes in hand with my constant fear  of ghosts and paranormal. I still close doors when I’m sleeping, I can’t sleep without a cover or pillow over my head because it feels like someone’s standing over me. If I don’t sleep with a cover over my head, disturbing monster images pop in my head. When I’m in certain places I also fear there will be ghosts or paranormal. Going down the stairs, public restrooms is where I think of it the post. It’s scary. (For me) Plus when paranormal or ghosts take over my brain for a bit I start to look at rooms to hard and start to actually see figures because I overthink it so much. I’ve told people about this and they say it’s severe anxiety. Another specific thing I experience is I can’t leave TVs off/ blank while I’m in the room because I’m afraid a figure will pop up on it so I have to leave something on the TV so the blank TV doesn’t mirror the room. I’m getting to old to be acting like this. It interferes with my everyday life. What do I do about my constant/anxiety/ paranoia it’s miserable .

Would it be bad if I cut off contact with my dad for the sake of my mental health?,0,0.5,"*please feel free to ask questions/give advice*

BACKGROUND: 
Hey guys a this might be long but just want you guys to get informed on me and my dads relationship. Growing up I never really saw my dad much maybe once a year, he lived about 30 minutes away from us but always stayed busy with ex gf and her daughter and my other two siblings. He was known for standing us up and saying he would come to pick us up and the day would come and he would show up. When I was about 10 he finally started coming around more but that was very short lived. Once he got a new gf he became immersed with her and his new family that consisted of her and her kids and his kids on weekends (my half siblings).. At one point when I was in high school we started going over a lot as my older sister formed a bond with his gf. My dad’s gf always had a preference for my sister, then she started coming off as very money hungry and jealous as she would constantly favor my sister a lot, so I began separating myself from all of them as a whole. Then my sister and my dad’s gf had a falling out and I found out my dad’s gf. The last time we met up, he embarrassed me by looking at my public record and confronting me in front of everyone at the table about something that he found (it’s not bad but it is a secret I was keeping from my sister and my family)

THE PROBLEM:
Me and my dad’s relationship has always been a sensitive topic for me, I always get nervous and anxious and tend to want validation from him. If I called my dad to come and help I know he would come, he’s always been one to come and help but that’s if I call him. He texts me randomly and it always gives me so much anxiety about how I respond and how he responds. I haven’t seen my dad face to face since December when I graduated college but it was only for 3 minutes then he left. He recently texted me and I just felt like he doesn’t know me at all and it depresses me a lot. Like he doesn’t know anything about my life like a regular dad usually does and that’s because he literally lives 10 minutes from me.

Side notes: 
I’ve talked to my sister about this and she has encouraged me just to maintain contact with my dad but we both have had different experiences with my dad, and she also tends to be more naïve and too forgiving when it comes to my dad. 

My views on this: 
I know it might be very immature of me but I just see my dads lack of effort to be in my life, I don’t want to communicate with him about anything or how I’m feeling, I just want him out of my life, I’m 21 and I’m tired of having this problem with my dad.

I was okay for about a year or so, then quickly started to decline back in late January early February. And got placed on 10mg escitalopram (lexapro) got a bit better. Still not feeling the feelings of happy. A week ago I was increased to 20.

Is it okay to feel this way?,1,1.0,"M19

Got diagnosed with MDD or clinical depression a little less than a year ago. Probably would've went undiagnosed had I not broken down in front of my parents. I feel as If my medication doesn't work (Wellbutrin XL) and I have long since lost the buzz from smoking.

I have been dealing with depression since around the age of 13. Up until recently I have kept to myself in hopes of feeling normal again. (At the time didn't know I was dealing with depression). Having a constant feeling of lifelessness has completely taken over me. I feel as if I am simply existing for no reason, following common symptoms of depression, I feel as if: I have no purpose, No Drive to do anything, No will. I feel as if I exist solely for my parents and friends. Somedays or weeks are worse than others where thoughts of self harm loom over my head, yet I don't fear it. I feel as if I would have taken up SH much sooner had I not dreaded the idea of my parents finding out, and as a result thinking differently of me. 

Exploring multiple discussions online and can't seem to grasp how some people just live with this constant feeling. What baffles me even further is how some people start to feel like themselves again, experiencing happiness that could only be found within their childhood. Not trying to seem like a gloomy doom lord, however I honestly don't know how that feeling of true joy would feel like now, when reminiscing on my innocent childhood. I can't possibly fathom living like this, rather than viewing life through rose tinted glasses, I see everything in an apathetic view. Nothing matters at all I feel, nothing I try will change this. I ruminate about my death constantly and it is pure dread not for my own life, but for my parents and close loved ones.

Hereditary Lack of Empathy ,4,1.0,"Hey folks… kind of a thought / vent / question I guess… trying to think of where to even start 

Ever since I was a child, a long as I can remember I have had a complete and total lack of empathy, like zero empathy. I didn’t know what to call it at the time, but as I’ve gotten older that’s what I’ve realized it to be. 

Someone could tell me their dog died last night, and everyone around me would be emotional and “oh my god im so sorry” and in my head I would have zero emotion whatsoever, like it didn’t even matter at all 

This has obviously led to some challenges in life, specifically with my spouse and trying to see others point of views. 

It’s challenging because in arguments I would basically have zero idea “what the big deal is” meanwhile everyone else is saying they can’t believe I don’t understand why someone is upset/sad/etc etc 

For several years now I’ve been told by others I lack empathy, so I’ve tried to find ways to “manually” cope with this problem… for example if someone said their dog died, I would say oh man I’m so sorry…. Even though I personally feel nothing about it, I just know via societal norms it’s just the right thing to say… so I’m basically solving the problem via superficial “emotional intelligence” more so then having any real thought or opinion or feeling on the matter 

Well recently I took one of those Genetic / DNA Tests and low and behold I got an alert saying that quote “I may lack empathy” because of a genetic mutation that actually physically makes it hard for me to chemically / emotionally have a reaction to these matters - so basically the entire things been genetic this entire time 

The problem obviously, is I don’t know any way to “fix” this , other then just trying to keep “faking it” and making sure I use proper language in empathetic situations without actually understanding at a deep level how it feels or what the issue is. 

Has anyone else ever felt or been this way?

Too much death too close... It's messing me up a bit...,2,1.0,"NOTE: I hope this is the proper place for this. I don't know where else to turn. And I have no idea who to talk to about this. I'm kind of in a bind at the moment...

It's going to happen. I know this! My cousin (younger than me) passed away in March 2023, my Mom passed away in October 2023, and my brother in January this year. I hurt! Not gonna lie! It's been tough! I just have been trying to deal with things. And on top of that, I have a memory loss issue (pretty serious... like forgetting stuff I SHOULDN'T be forgetting kind of seriousness!). I'm unemployed so I can't afford to go see a specialist to even figure out what it could possibly be. My wife is on disability and she gets SSI so I can't get coverage under her. My brother was 62 when he passed apparently of a heart attack. He didn't even know he had a heart condition. It just all of a sudden got him. I'm almost 59 so, that kind of hits me where it hurts.

So, I'm dealing with some things. Heavy things that I can barely wrap my head around. Like, I want to be here to see my grand-kids. But now I don't know if that's even going to happen. I'm hoping it will, but I could be gone tomorrow without warning. It's part of life and I dealt with that pretty well until my cousin then my brothers passing.

I am looking into a free clinic thing but with something like this, I'm afraid, it won't be free. I'm hoping it'll be way less than it would be going to a regular doctor and getting a referral and all that. But I don't even know if free clinics even look at brain/memory disorders. That seems like a pretty big deal. Something that wouldn't/shouldn't be free or discounted. 

So yeah, the memory loss thing and the family loss thing... It's scaring the ever loving crap out of me at the moment. But I have to be strong and let it ride. I'm going to have fun while I can. I play drums (hence the name) and really, that's the main thing that gives me pleasure these days. Just sitting down at the kit and playing my heart out on them. I'm really having fun doing that. And, I also love my family but I feel bad that if I'm gone within the next couple of years, that'll devastate my wife and my daughter especially... as well as my sister and my father. It's scary! And in some way, I feel like I may be alienating them because I don't want them to feel the devastation I feel now. I don't know what to do... where to turn... If this memory loss thing is simple to fix with medicine then I'm hoping I don't miss that train without insurance and looking for a free clinic that won't be able to figure out what this is. 

I've made a couple of calls this week and I'm waiting for someone to call me back. I will call them again tomorrow and find out where they're at with this.

Unsure what to do,1,1.0,"Topics: anxiety, paranoia, delusions

[Undiagnoised: family history of bipolar, however I typically show more signs towards BPD]

I [F20] have been experiencing intense anxiety for over a year now that has only gotten progressively worse. Over time I’ve noticed that I’ve stopped going outside during the day time and seeing anybody. At first I was just anxious and worried I would embarrass myself by being sick or having a panic attack in public and so avoided it, but I’ve noticed recently that I’ve gotten very paranoid too. Every time I’m around somebody, I feel as though they are reading my mind and judging everything I think. Or if I’m outside at night [usually the only time I can bring myself to do so now] I feel as though someone is following me and waiting to hurt me or that there are people staring at me from inside their houses. 

I was on track to attend university in September, however I’ve been self destructing and isolating and basically shutting myself off from the world. My Mum [who I don’t live with] has been messaging me and seems quite frustrated with me, so I tried to explain my situation [as much as I comfortably could] but I don’t think she understands just how much it is impacting me. I can’t do anything anymore, all I do is sit in my room all day. It sort of feels as though I’m waiting for something?

On top of the paranoia, I recently “re-connected” with God and started “feeling his presence” more and originally felt as though he was going to “cure me” of all of this. However it then escalated very quickly into delusions about an old teacher that I fixated on. For context: a few years ago at school, I became fixated with my religious studies teacher and believed that I had a spiritual connection to her and was destined to be in her life? and I completely recovered from that mind set in my time away from her, however recently a friend of mine said that she attended a new church and met said teacher there. According to my friend the teacher mentioned me and asked if I would attend the church. I think this sparked something in my brain because now everything feels like a sign again. However, all whilst I think these things, I’m completely aware of how utterly delusional I sound… but they just make too much sense??

Ugh, I don’t know.

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I probably need to be on some kind of medication but I also don’t want to go through the embarrassment of telling somebody about these thoughts in person. And even though I don’t believe my delusional thoughts, part of me want’s to “wait and see” what other signs I would receive if I went to the church and saw the teacher ETC…

What to do When Your Friend Makes You Feel Like a Fish?,1,0.99,"Hello. Prefacing this by saying I've read over the rules, and this post seems fine. I'm not sure if this falls under the ""don't ask for relationship advice"", because I'm not dating this friend. My apologies if it isn't. Breaking any rules wasn't intentional.

In this context, to feel like a fish means to feel like you're stuck in a glass box being watched. But only when the humans are interested in you, which they usually aren't.

I have a friend, the only friend I've had in a few years, I'd guess. We're two years apart in age, both minors. I also have trouble with sleep and can barely stay functionally conscious for more than six hours a day.

Every time I wake up, I check my phone and I have discord messages from him. I read 'em, respond, and he asks me to chat. And then I get on and I...sit there. For hours on end. While he does other stuff that doesn't relate to me at all. Sometimes, we do text-based roleplays. Totally SFW stuff, obviously. We talk then, but if it isn't something he's actively interested in, he often gets distracted and forgets what we were doing. That usually leads to us stopping (because I feel awkward having to keep reminding him).

I feel like there is something wrong with me,1,1.0,"I really feel like there is something wrong with me. I don’t want to go down a list of things, but I feel like some of them are an important to mention.

I don’t know if this directly relates with the struggles I’m going through, but this had such a big impact on my life it’s definitely ntely worthy to mention.

When I was around 11 or 12, my mother and father got into a huge fight which resulted in my mother leaving my family with no forewarning to Ohio, where she stayed with her sister for a month. She blocked my brothers, me, and my father and refused to talk to my father. It hurt me a lot and I remember crying because I made her her favorite dish and bought her coffee so she can feel better when she came back.

I really have no idea why this affected me as much as I did. I can’t live my life in peace and even tho this incident happened years ago, I still think about it often and when I do it just brings me to tears.

I feel like it’s just me who is struggling with this because it doesn’t have seemed to affect my brother or my father.

But another big thing that happend was right after my mom got back, I was cooking some stew and I guess didn’t clean up my mess very well, because my mother and I got into a huge fight where she proceeded to yell at me and tell me that she wishes I was dead and that she wishes me to be 18 sooner so I can leave the house. I cried so hard after that. I still tear up about it when I think about it.

She also talked very openly and several times infront of my brothers and I about how she wanted to divorce my father and leave back to Korea. To this day she denies the part where she yelled at me where she wished I died, and telling me constantly how she wanted to divorce my dad.

Anyway, recently I’ve noticed a pattern in my behavior. I literally get such bad anxiety when I’m not around people. I need to be with a friend constantly, or be at a social setting or else I feel so alone and my anxiety flares up. The school season ended recently and I wake up with so much anxiety. It gets worse around the late afternoon before nighttime. This anxiety has been there for a while but it’s just recently where I have noticed this.

I also find myself using drugs and alcohol to alleviate the pain I feel. I just don’t know what this pain is exactly. I want to pin point exactly what’s causing this so I can just get rid of it but I just don’t know what it is.

Thoughts of suicide has crossed my mind multiple times, but I am religious and in my religion it is prohibited to be end myself. So I don’t. 

No one knows I’m struggling and I want to talk to someone but I’m just not brave enough. I feel like there’s something wrong with me. I don’t know what to do.

i don’t know what to do,1,1.0,"im so tired

so lately i’ve been having panic attacks (whatever it is when you’re crying, laughing, hyperventilating, all that) around being scared of being sick/emetophobia and really in general for the past year and its exhausting because it physically takes so much and i can’t process my emotions enough to make it stop


i had gastritis and that’s given me fear of eating and getting sick for about a year. i can’t feel safe unless i have snacks that help with nausea, medicine, and wait at least 4 hours before going to bed

this on top of my summer (blues? depression idk) stuff is making me miserable. i’ve dealt with bullying and depression when i was 12 and since then i’ve been bad mentally and really insecure and suicidal to the point where i’ve developed anxiety around socializing, food, and general anything

im in therapy but its so hard to talk about this and hope she gets it. im always downplaying everything and i find it impossible to make it sounds like how it feels. bc i can say how it feels but it hurts much more than i can say it. my family has gotten better at seeing it but i still can’t make it clear enough. mostly cause i’ve developed a sort of happy persona where i cannot be sad unless i’m alone or panicking and can’t hold onto to pretending. its that or laughing when things get serious.

i just want normal things at this point. i want to drive and eat without being scared, and be with my friends, and all that. and i’m expected to act like an adult next year and i’m graduating. yet i have no life and im sheltered, sensitive and anxious about everything

I also have ADHD, and I'm unsure if this might be contributing to why I feel hypersexual or horny all the time. I've read that impulsivity and hyperfocus, which are common with ADHD, can sometimes manifest as increased sexual desire, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening in my case.

I'm looking for advice on how to cope with these feelings in a healthy way. Are there any strategies or treatments that can help reduce these urges? Should I consider seeing a therapist or a medical professional, and if so, what type of specialist would be best suited to help with this issue?

what is this?,1,1.0,"So I was overthinking if I should even write this because I'm nervous to hear what people have to say. But let's do it. About 4 months ago I had one of my worst panic attacks resulting in my going to the ER as I completely shut down... (I had had minor ones a few different times but nth as bad as this). I passed it as soon as I went to the ER and was comforted by my family but I was still confused as to why I felt like I was going to die or have some heart attack (what it felt like lol). Ever since that day I struggled for months overthinking ""what if it happens again?"" ""What will I do if that panic attack happens again"" ""no one understands me"" ""I'm doomed I'll never feel normal again"" and over analyzed every. Single. Thing. About how I felt , acted ,etc . just to make sure that I wouldn't ever get a panic attack like that day I mentioned. And guess what? I never did have a panic attack ever since but instead passed through some health anxiety until eventually I got over that and got blood tested , ekg and all that  and realized I'm perfectly healthy and there's no reason to be worried and concerned as to why I had that panic attack and it indeed was just a episode.

NOW 
I'm doing (Thank God) much better;I have my off days (usually days when I'm sad or tired) , where I get a little anxious but it's more of a overthinking feeling as to where I'm over analyzing as to WHY I got that way those 4 months ago. Idk how to word it but it's like almost im traumatized from that panic attack and so disappointed that I let myself get like that and I catch my self remembering the feelings I had weeks after that panic attack in which I'd be depressed and uneasy. Again, I feel fine I just feel sad when I think about those days kind of like I can't get over that phase. I keep overthinking and sometimes worry like ""oh will that happen again?""

I don't think I'm getting better,5,0.86,"Hi, I'm turning 20 in November, yet I feel like there really isn't much to life. The idea of graduating with a degree, pursuing a career that I'm passionate about, building a family all seems so mundane to me.

I truly envy others who seemingly know what they're doing and wasting no time, thinking about useless stuff like what I'm doing to work towards their goals. I sound like a lazy person that's complaining about every minute thing right now, but the truth is I probably am. But I like to think that I've put an effort to not feel this way but yet I feel nothing.

I feel disconnected from everyone. Parents speak about trusting God and his plans. Good friends all have sound advice for me to deal with this feeling, however I've never been able to resonate with any of it. I'm truly lost. Perhaps I'm finding an excuse to working hard by feeling this way. Maybe not. Either way I'm feeling it.

I used to blame my parents for my upbringing. It may as well be their fault for me being like this. Eventually I've come to accept that holding it against them solves nothing, so I blame myself. I really see no possible future where I can love existing as  the person that I am. I have no idea who I am anymore. Everyday I have a hundred thoughts for every single thing I want to do. It's exhausting and I don't think I can do it anymore.

I'm scared of the pain of dying. But sometimes I wish I had the balls to do it. This whole life thing is not working out for me no matter what bullshit mindset I'm forcing myself to have. I'm gonna start praying I don't wake up the next day starting from tonight.

A lot to unwind.,1,1.0,"

I’m a 17-year-old boy on a plane from New York to Chicago. My life truly began at 15 when I started asking questions and became self-aware. At 14, I watched ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" which changed my life. I wished I could be Spider-Man, sneaking out at night to climb buildings, hoping to become him. When I realized I couldn’t, I turned to making money. 

At 15, I struggled mentally, feeling like I was going insane. I buzzed my head and spent two summers working non-stop. My thoughts were so overwhelming that I'd run barefoot to Kendrick Lamar at 3-5 am. Last summer, as a sophomore, I felt fulfilled for the first time: working, running, and repeating the cycle. 

This junior year, I made a lot of money and can now travel and buy almost anything. But something is still missing; I never fulfilled my Spider-Man dream. It feels like I chased money because I couldn’t be Spider-Man. Now, at 17, time feels relentless, and I realize I took my struggles and time for granted. 

I went to New York, hoping for fulfillment, but it didn’t satisfy me as I thought it would. I can't believe time is passing; I thought I'd stay 15-16 forever. As I near the end of my teenage years, I never got to be a teenager in New York with cool spider friends or scale skyscrapers. The rest of my life seems destined to chase fulfillment through business and helping others, even though those stories aren’t as cool as being Spider-Man.

Sad devil guy,1,1.0,"Where to begin? Well I'm the devil, I go by many different names, Lucifer, Satan you know the whole 9.

Why do I break everything that I touch? I lost all my friends due to my Lucifer character, I should have kept my identity to myself, I was stubborn to think that they'd understand me for what I'm truly am, a monster. 

I hate looking into the mirror, every time I look at a mirror I see a distorted version of myself, it's monsterist and ugly, and I hate looking at myself, I don't think I'd ever love myself, because i don't believe in Love, there's no such thing as love, if others can't love me, then why should I love me?

I wrote my message into a poem:

Where do i begin here? Just know that I'm the devil, 'listen' of what i say. 

I go by so many names, just call me by one of these names, 'Satan' that's my name.

I wanna rant what's on my mind with no escape, I'm dying inside: 'help me' just listen close. 

I hate it here, don't understand why I'm here, what's the plan?: 'killed me' planting my tomb.

Why I'm here, is it worth it? Should of left I guess I deserve it,: 'hate me' i burned me too.

Why I break what I touch? I lost my friends
Of my character,: 'they caged me' broken wings.

I'm stuck here no way out, don't you see I'm whelmed out,: 'drinking, and smoking weed'

Someday I am leaving, no need to come and see me, 'relieve me': from my tomb.

I'm going to my throne, where I belong, my legs are crossed my crown is on,: 'see me' I'm on the throne. I'm sorry there's no way out, I'm sorry there's no way up, but down, straight down.

We strive to do better only to lose all in the end. We make connections destined to be severed. We all suffer to survive until we are all one last breath away from the inevitable. We fall short.

I did not choose to wake up yet another day. None of us did. Yet we drag ourselves into the mundane rhythm of life, away from the fresh horrors of our last nightmare. We seem to care while none cares for us. We fool ourselves into thinking that we will do better the next time, the next day. We push ourselves through false hope only to be reminded that there is no time left. We fall short.

All of us are clueless. We just flutter around bumping into things, bouncing off of people, drowning in thoughts, chasing after dreams, and eventually overthinking ourselves to death. We all think our suffering is unique when in truth it is our collective suffering that makes us doomed to fail. In the end, none of it will matter as we will all fall short.

Can I become less emotionally numb and more empathetic or is this just my personality?,3,1.0,"Hi everyone! I’m not sure if this is the right place but I could really use some advice as I’ve been trying to change this for years but feel stuck. I feel like I’ve always had a very dampened emotional experience compared to other people. I’m like the opposite of a sensitive person, I’m pretty indifferent to most things and nothing really bothers me or if they do I can get over it pretty quick. I do feel emotions but most of the time they’re not very strong or they pass very quickly. I’m pretty sure this is because of my worldview - I’m quite ‘existential’ bordering on nihilistic tbh and life feels meaningless. I feel like I’m always searching for ‘more’ from life and would describe living as boring, kind of like “is this it?” In that way I suppose I’m some version of depressed but atypically so. 

Anyway because I’m like this I find it really hard to relate to other people’s experiences which always seem to be quite emotionally charged. E.g. I’ve always found the notion of anxiety to be confusing as I can’t imagine caring about anything enough to be anxious about it. It simply is not that deep (to me). But I don’t like that I’m like this because I can’t effectively support my friends when they share certain experiences. I just can’t get my head around why they care so much. 

I’ve not long finished a 15 month stint of therapy to tackle this issue but I don’t think it helped at all. I haven’t had any trauma and I’ve lived a pretty normal life up till now.

15 Y/O Asynchronous Development Questions,3,1.0,"Ever since I was a kid, my brain has been wired for curiosity, and I’ve always loved learning through hands-on experiences. Now, as a high school student, I see myself as different from my peers. While the typical ’s underclassmen's life revolves around school, video games, sports, and friends, I’m the opposite. I gravitate towards activities usually associated with 'adult work'. I enjoy learning how to wire a house with electricity, plumb a shed, configure an AV system for a home theater, or maintain a pool system and everything else in this sort.

I’ve always been comfortable speaking with adults and have never felt a strong desire to make friends or socialize with people my age. Sports and video games have never interested me much. Despite my hands-on skills and problem-solving abilities, I sometimes feel a step behind in school. I’m confident in myself—not socially awkward, just a quiet, smart (ish) kid. I rarely feel embarrassed by having different views from my peers, and I don’t have a deep desire to form friendships. Whereas I will always gravitate to humans that share the same skill sets as me. This is why I think I socialize with adults better.

Seeking Advice: How to Help a Parent Obsessed with Alternative Therapies and Misinformation,1,1.0,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m deeply concerned about my mother’s behavior and I’m not sure how to handle it. Over the past few years, she has become increasingly obsessed with alternative therapies and health misinformation she finds online. She constantly complains about various health issues that no doctor has been able to diagnose, and as a result, she avoids traditional medical care altogether.

Instead, she spends a lot of time researching and trying out various alternative therapies like chlorine dioxide, biomagnetism, and even urine therapy. She’s also heavily involved in online groups that promote these practices and buys into remote therapies and dubious treatments from so-called ""doctors"" she meets online.

She’s completely distrustful of vaccines and mainstream medicine, frequently shares misinformation, and tries to convince others to adopt her beliefs. I’ve tried reasoning with her and presenting scientific information, but nothing seems to work.

How do I let life in?,1,1.0,"At the end of last year I was really in a very rough place mentally and although I’m far from where I want to be, I’m proud to say I’ve made real leaps and bounds in terms of general mood and I think self love.

However, although my life and outlook on life comes from a much sincerer and mostly positive place there’s some issues pressing on me. 

I feel somewhat hardened. As though the pain I’ve endured (and am continuing to endure in the case of my family) has wrapped me up in a protective shell, which is in many ways a fantastic thing. 

I feel much more capable of protecting myself from people emotionally and just in general at the moment, I feel very strong. The downside is I’m having a little trouble letting a whole lot in. 

I’m struggling to connect with people truly, to let down that defensive barrier and let in love. 

I’m not sure how much of this is just the human condition, some Buddhist general “life is suffering” type deal, if I’ve become slightly deharmonised from life or if this is just the bittersweet curse of aging and growth.

Whatever it is, I’ve gotta say. Not a fan.

Why am I indifferent about everything?,1,1.0,"It's a question I ask myself for the last 5-7 years. Is it bad to not be bothered about anything? I'm 24 now but I feel like I always have felt indifferent about pretty much anything. I like some things, I have hobbies and things I wanna become but I'm not obsessed about anything. I like my hobbies but if for some reason I stopped tomorrow, I would be perfectly fine. All of the people I know have something that they say they cannot live without. It's not the same with me. I may like something but deep down I don't really care about it. It's not the end of the world for me if I can't do it for some reason. 

Also I have never felt emotions that deeply. I've loved someone some years back and I still love them, but I can still live my life without them so I don't mind. Even family members. I love them and I don't want something bad to happen to them, but even if something happens, serious or not, I need to really push myself to remember to care about them. 

Also on the topic of death, I feel totally ok with it. Even when I lost my grandparents, I pushed myself to cry so that others can see that I care. But I wasn't feeling anything. I didn't feel sad, happy, anger. I didn't feel anything.

A lot of times I think that I don't feel that much. Maybe I know how I should feel but in the end of the day I don't care that much. It won't change the universe whatever happens.

Back then ,1,1.0,"Back then , life was simpler , I didn't care about how I looked , I would wear pj's all day , and everyone still loved me. 

Snapchat filters weren't a big thing for me , id take my pictures raw.  Now I can't bare my face without them 

Idk what happened I used to be content with how I looked and then boom I felt unrecognizable, I hate myself , my face , my forehead , my cheeks , my chin , my lips , my stomach , I hate it all . 

And I can't help but think why am I so ugly ? So fat , why do I gain the weight the way I do ? Why am the ugliest of them all. 

I feel embarrassed and I can't help but think this is why I'm single

I can't help but think I don't deserve love because of my weight , because of my face . 

It's such a horrible and ugly way to think but I cant help it .

I take selfies I look good with filters of course
Someone takes a picture of me and I am absolutely shattered by what I see .

An oger ... A monster . Ya I really do see myself like that . And I can't stand it anymore I'm always in a shitty mood. I can't even be a good mom because I'm always ashamed of myself I pass by a store with glass windows and see my reflection and I am automatically distraught .. pissed .. upset . 

I blame myself for being like this no one else . 

Idk . I wasn't always like this . And it's gotten really bad . 

Mh aunt randomly messaged me saying she's proud of how far I've come. 

And all I can think of , is how far I haven't come . 
No one knows my struggles and when I openly talk about them people just brush them off or act like it isn't a big deal.

advice for dealing with financial debt with severe depression,1,1.0,"hi guys. i was debating on even posting this because it genuinely it is one of the most embarrassing and shameful things for me to admit and i don't want people to ever find me saying this on the internet - but i figured since no one even knows i use this account i figured why not ask now and then delete it later.

but regardless, i need serious advice.  

how do you recover from being financially unstable and in debt? i have a full time job already but it's just not cutting it...and i'm looking for a 2nd part-time job but i've had zero luck so far because they need people who will be more flexible with their schedule, and because i already work 8-5, it's hard to find jobs that i can work at in the evening (without it being a fast food restaurant). 

my parents weren't ever really involved in my life and they never really explained the importance of being financially stable, being responsible with your credit card, etc. they aren't really supportive of my mental health either which is why i decided to post it here instead of some financial subreddit. if there's another place i can post this pls lmk.

but anyways, i let it get this bad because my depression is just...so severe. and because my parents are so freakishly unsupportive of anything that's remotely close to mental illness, i've been untreated and i've only seen about 2 therapists both of which have flopped. i did however see a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with bpd and ocd. i'm 22 years old. i've dealt with emotionally and mentally abusive parents for 10+ years, and i've dealt with very toxic relationships that have drained me of me of my money. 

last year i was very very suicidal and had a clear vision in my mind i was going to commit suicide by the end of 2023, and for months i was VERY set on my decision. so i spent way too much money especially on my credit card because in my head i was going to kill myself anyways so there was no point in me trying to get ahold of myself. i've thought about it many many times but i was 100% set with a plan to die at the end of 2023 since i have had nothing to live for, even myself. i made a lot of dumb decisions financially because i truly believed it was the end of my life and i was honestly okay with that. 

obviously now it's june 2024 and things have happened and i'm still alive and somehow surviving. i'm somewhat better than before, considering i've been in a really healthy relationship that's given me some purpose, but i'm still not okay at all. especially now dealing with the repercussions and consequences of my own actions. i work full time monday-friday but the money i make right now isn't enough to cover the debt i have. i babysit every now and then and i'm trying to look for a secondary job but i've had no luck so far. and i'm scared of overworking myself because then i'm really just never gonna prioritize myself at all. i want to move out and better myself (especially since the household i live in is one of the reasons i'm so fucked in the head) but i have no money in my savings because everything just goes towards my credit card and obviously my credit card debt is more than i can handle.

i'm just really stuck. i'm not here to beg for money and i will never ask, all i'm asking for is help and a direction on what to do. i have nobody in my life i can turn to about this and i just don't know what to do.

It's all catching up with me,1,1.0,"I've lurked on reddit for a while but it feels like it's time to post.

I feel like I've had a lot of stuff happen in my first 32 years of life. Bullying from a very early age, numerous close family members passing away, family members with serious health conditions that need support, losing a parent (death) early on, serious health condition myself at 22 (resolved, thankfully),  marriage, divorce, quick career progression and now facing the decline of the 2nd parent and a sibling in my early 30's, and dealing with everything that goes with that.

I feel like some of this is unusual but some isn't, recognise that many people have their own battles to fight, or, just cope with. But lately it's all catching up with me - the demands of my work vs the financial security it brings, my remaining parent and the support required (which I absolutely do not begrudge but healthcare systems make social support practically impossible), trying to just deal with the demands of life and, God forbid, actually make some time for myself and seeing my amazing friends (who are scattered to say the least and busy living their own lives so I definitely don't want to burden them with my stuff...I'm only willing to burden reddit users apparently...) I honestly don't know how people with kids function, you have my eternal respect.

I feel like a decade and a half of hardship is catching up with me and I'm losing it.

I need help understanding what's going on in my brain,1,1.0,"For context, I'm an 18 year old male, with autism (level 1/high functioning). Recently, I've had a few strange episodes, mostly with seeing things that were never really there, remembering having conversations that never actually happened and forgetting important things at random intervals, like forgetting where I am, what I was doing, etc. Usually if I dig deep into my brain I can remember the most important parts, like why I went somewhere and what I was doing, but details are almost always lost. However, this isn't the reason I'm making this post. This week I've had two different episodes: the first one, where I couldn't sleep and decided to walk around my house, had me feeling like I was being watched/hunted, and I felt like anything could just pop out of the shadows and eat me alive. Every time I opened a door or turned a corner, gore or some kind of disturbing image would pop into my mind, entirely involuntarily. I finally managed to sleep at 4 am, with my curtains open so the streetlights would lightly illuminate my room, because being in the dark frightened me to my core (I've never been afraid of the dark). The second episode was yesterday, where I felt like my mind wasn't really mine. It's almost like an intrusive thought, except way more agressive and constant. These ""thoughts"" also came with an almost incontrollable urge to>!hurt myself!<, which I tried my best not to do, even going as far as to >!dig my nails really hard into my arm so I could maybe try and calm myself down.!<I'm afraid of this happening in public, so I'm trying my best to not leave my room, and I'm even considering locking my door so I don't go out as often.

No-one’s *ever* said that about me. That I’m attractive. Or pretty. Or cute. Or complimented my appearance in any way other than a purely friendly and non-romantic way.

I struggle a lot with my self-confidence. It’s hard to not see your entire existence as an odd and unnatural, perhaps even accidental, spot in the world. If I have no friends, and if the only person who loves me is my own mom, surely I’m the problem? Something must be wrong with *me*.

Anyway. I got money for my birthday and in a desperate attempt to strangle my anxiety, I brought video games. Lots of them. I brought 11 DLC’s for this game I’ve been playing a lot recently (the DLC’s were on sale… I brought all of the ones I didn’t have). It didn’t take long before my entire body just… itched to get as far away from my computer as possible. Suddenly the game wasn’t even remotely fun, in fact nothing was. I felt like a tornado of anxiety was going on a rampage in my head. I couldn’t sit still and relax, I just couldn’t, I literally began pacing around the room.

Skip ahead another hour, I manage to sit down in my bed and calm down. Now I feel a weird emptiness instead. I’ve felt it before, but only two other times that I can recall. Both appeared after an extremely intense breakdown, kind of like I drained my entire system of any and all feelings. I was neither happy nor sad. I wasn’t angry, I wasn’t worried, I wasn’t anything. An empty shell staring off into space without even having a particular opinion on what to eat for dinner.

Now it’s happened again and I have no idea how to make it go away. I stupidly brought even more video games, anything to make me feel something, all I ended up with was anxiety for spending my money. So much for being an adult, I’ve already wasted god knows how much on video games today… and I don’t even want to play them.",mentalhealth,Round_Associate_8136,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfcsog/suddenly_i_feel_empty/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13185979184521e-06,"['today', 'birthday', 'really', 'past', 'midnight', 'yesterday', 'birthday', 'night', 'felt', 'much', 'anxiety', 'broke', 'cried', 'irl', 'friend', 'never', 'relationship', 'never', 'job', 'fuck', 'achieved', 'online', 'friend', 'posted', 'pic', 'gym', 'pas', 'discord', 'server', 'people', 'complimented', 'called', 'attractive', 'friend', 'good', 'tone', 'ever', 'said', 'attractive', 'pretty', 'cute', 'complimented', 'appearance', 'way', 'purely', 'friendly', 'way', 'struggle', 'lot', 'hard', 'see', 'entire', 'existence', 'odd', 'unnatural', 'perhaps', 'even', 'accidental', 'spot', 'world', 'friend', 'person', 'love', 'mom', 'surely', 'problem', 'something', 'must', 'wrong', 'anyway', 'got', 'money', 'birthday', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'strangle', 'anxiety', 'brought', 'video', 'game', 'lot', 'brought', 'dlc', 'game', 'playing', 'lot', 'recently', 'dlc', 'brought', 'one', 'take', 'long', 'entire', 'body', 'itched', 'get', 'far', 'away', 'computer', 'possible', 'suddenly', 'game', 'even', 'remotely', 'fun', 'fact', 'nothing', 'felt', 'like', 'tornado', 'anxiety', 'going', 'rampage', 'head', 'sit', 'still', 'relax', 'literally', 'began', 'pacing', 'around', 'room', 'skip', 'ahead', 'another', 'hour', 'manage', 'sit', 'bed', 'calm', 'feel', 'weird', 'emptiness', 'instead', 'felt', 'two', 'time', 'recall', 'appeared', 'extremely', 'intense', 'breakdown', 'kind', 'like', 'drained', 'entire', 'system', 'feeling', 'neither', 'happy', 'sad', 'angry', 'worried', 'anything', 'empty', 'shell', 'staring', 'space', 'without', 'even', 'particular', 'opinion', 'eat', 'dinner', 'happened', 'idea', 'make', 'go', 'away', 'stupidly', 'brought', 'even', 'video', 'game', 'anything', 'make', 'feel', 'something', 'ended', 'anxiety', 'spending', 'money', 'much', 'adult', 'already', 'wasted', 'god', 'know', 'much', 'video', 'game', 'even', 'want', 'play']","{'neg': 0.138, 'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': -0.9144}",negative

Residential care for 8-year-old with pediatric bipolar?,3,1.0,"My 8-year-old son has been struggling with mental illness for a couple of years now, and after several psychiatrists, medication regimens, and fruitless therapy sessions, we are looking at residential programs. This is an incredibly hard decision, but he has become violent, actually injuring me (his father), his mom, and his older brother many times. Property destruction is in the thousands at this point. Last week he began threatening self-harm, and at that point I began to surrender to the inevitability of hospitalization. 

He's been diagnosed with pediatric bipolar disorder, but as you know, psychiatric diagnoses pre-puberty are dicey. At the very least, I can say that he becomes explosively angry over unpredictable things (i.e. his pajamas are in the wash, his cat doesn't come when called, we're out of bananas). He has also begun sobbing fits over similarly unpredictable matters -- not just fit-pitching, but episodes that look like a grieving child. His last month of the school year was marred by a dozen absences when he simply refused to go -- crawling under his bed crying. When we actually made it to school, he frequently vomited (I'm pretty sure he has learned to throw up at will), and we had no choice but to pick him up. Needless to say, the outlook isn't auspicious.

Disconnected feeling when coming out of depression,1,1.0,"Kind of nervous to post out of an irrational fear talking about it might ruin it, but after 2.5 years of a really bad, treatment-resistant depression, it seems to have shifted a bit and for the past six weeks I've been in a more neutral space.

Something intriguing/strange I'm experiencing sometimes is the feeling like I'm dead or in a dream, and my experience should have ended a long time ago and some mistake has been made that I'm still conscious and doing things. I guess it's a strong feeling of disconnection or something.

Emotionally numb ,2,1.0,"I am now 18 and I’ve had a deeply volatile and traumatic childhood, my dad was cruel to me in my young years and kept introducing new “step mothers” into my life and would expect me and my two younger siblings to cooperate and accept these new family cultures and ways of life immediately every time. 
I won’t go on for too long I hope, but when I was 12 he introduced me to my third step mother (his third relationship since he and my mum divorced when I was 5). 

She was nice at first but I always felt something off about her. She went on to be emotionally abusive, cruel and manipulative for the entirety of their relationship until six months ago, when she up and left out of absolutely nowhere. 

I have experienced a lot of abandonment and abrupt change in my life, when my other step mums left, through various other family conflicts, and this time too - my dad and her have a child together, my sweet youngest brother. She also had two younger children who were my step siblings for 7 years. Her cruel parents also lived with us for the majority of their relationship and they are now gone too. 

I can’t feel emotional about it… I don’t feel any emotional attachment or sentiment to the whole situation. 

I can’t even really process the traumas I went through but all I know is that I feel like I am avoiding even trying. 

I had a lot of physical, emotional and sexual abuse through this time, I also dealt with depression and very high levels of anxiety due to significant traumas I witnessed and experienced, however I  had to always keep my thoughts and feelings hidden to avoid conflict between the family as she was very controlling and I was forbid to speak up.  

Why don’t I feel sad or angry or hurt? I feel nothing, it feels like nothing ever happened. 

I love my brother and her kids so much yet I never get to see them anymore, they left our home one day and never came back. I don’t even know where they live. 

I feel unavailable to everyone and like I don’t want a reason to see her but I really want my siblings to be ok and I feel a responsibility to make sure that happens, as I am the oldest.

My mediocrity kills my motivation ,2,1.0,"I know we roughly speaking are all average, with some exceptions no doubt. However I am not one of those exceptions instead I am intoxicated with the delusion of unworthiness. I know I’m not prone to failure anymore then the average person is- but I don’t feel like that. I struggle with the idea that I can be normal- have an intimate relationship, have friends and have a skill. I know logically that I can- I’m not prevented in any significant way from having that but despite this I don’t feel normal. It’s strange to me- I have everyone around me I’m doing well, teachers, parents. Yet I feel like they are lying to me, even if I know they are not. 

I tried hobbies guitar, bass, piano, creating adventure maps in video games. Yet I quit- I do enjoy them I really do but then I listen to music or play an actual game, or try to get people to try my game. Then I hate my voice, my dexterity, my ability, my creativity. It’s not terrible but it’s average. I need to accept that because some people don’t have talent and that’s okay. I know it’s okay but I don’t feel okay, I feel useless, pointless, helpless. 

For my career choice I’m going to study physics and I feel much the same. I do absolutely love to learn about the universe and its laws. I find it endlessly fascinating, but I’m definitely not the smartest person in our school. I likely won’t discover quantum gravity, or anything significant and likely just contribute nothing.

My point is that it bothers me.

I can’t anymore ,1,1.0,"I am always the one in the family who has EVER de-escalated an argument. Proof of Thur 13th June (yesterday as of writing) argument is enough as even when I was broken beyond belief I still tried to de-escalate but can’t when I am the focal point of the argument. This is further proof I can never open up my true feelings to either of my family as an argument happens 

Before you say that is a lie or even think of denying it just think who you go to in the house when you’re annoyed, frustrated or dealing with an issue. That’s right me. I am sure you noticed that when I am the focal point of an argument it escalates as without me to de-escalate no “peace occurs”.

Dad you say you want to keep the peace then please learn to de-escalate and not escalate like you always do. Don’t think of denying it as when amber and you argued you wanted to call the police and without me there you would have called the police as you wanted which would have made things worse. 

You dare say I have no empathy when I not only have my emotions and issues weighing on me but yours amber and all my friends. Not even starting to grace the pain and sorrow i went through with mum and as you guessed whenever around mum I was the one de-escalating. 

I am never able to say why I am truly always on my phone and until now I couldn’t give a true reason but deep down I knew why. Well after the recent argument with you I know why as you distract myself from all the dark emotions I have. 

I can never speak to anyone in this house about anything I am thinking of and never plan to as I have too much of a burden that you don’t even realise. Just as I was writing this you came upstairs to “talk” but all it was, was mainly you making it worse with you claiming you were de-escalating a potential future argument with amber and myself but nope you weren’t even if you think you were. To de-escalate you would need a calm face to start but the face you gave then was the complete opposite. You looked at me with a face of disgust and anger nowhere near calm. It is no fault of your own as from what you told me at a young age you weren’t able to learn how to calmly de-escalate an argument.

Is there something wrong with me?,1,1.0,"I go through these states where I feel so lonely that I don’t even know what I’m feeling anymore. And it keeps happening again and again.
I come from the middle of the countryside and anyone remotely my age moved away as they can’t afford to live here. I’m also the only person openly gay in town so I also gotta contend with the old ass religious traditional values that treat me like the devil. Half the town is high and the other half raciest, homophobic bigots. It makes me feel isolated and like I’ll never find someone and belong.

The problem is I try to do things I love to move away from feeling like that but it all just seems to make it worse. If I try to read, I gravitate to romance and horror which emphasises the feelings of being alone and how I don’t have the only thing I really want. If I try to play games I think about how all my friends have moved away. If I go to the gym it reminds me I’m different because I’m gay as they all dance around me like I’m infected. If I try and write music, it’s about my ex and how I still love them even after everything years ago or how I feel like I’m being pulled apart.
It makes me feel like I’m going insane as these things aren’t helping but they are the only things I can find any motivation to do. So I’m just making me self feel numb and vacant.

is there a way out?,2,1.0,"It's been a while. When I was 12 i used to cut myself in the bathroom because I didn't want to go on, I made progress since (i am now in my 20s), but i think this is the end of the road for me. I have lost two close family members, one very young, one very old, over the last one year. I suspect that has made it worse. I have a boyfriend who loves me and I feel tremendous amounts of guilt wanting to die this badly, but I just feel like it needs to be done. I don't feel satisfaction in my work, I don't feel like I have great friendships and even at times when I did I never felt like life was worth living. I keep losing people and with these losses I have lost so much of myself that I cannot recognise myself anymore. I focus on things that shouldn't be focussed on, I'm materialistic to the point of self-hatred. I have tried speaking with professionals before but there is something so unappealing about it that I'm struggling to go back even though my boyfriend keeps encouraging me to. I used to think I have to go on for my parents and my sister but I have reached a point where the pain of living has exceeded the guilt of dying. When I close my eyes, I can't envision a future for myself. I can't see myself getting married even though I love scrolling through wedding dress pictures trying to choose one and have been with my incredible boyfriend for over four years.

I feel like I am being judged at every given point in my life!!!,1,1.0,"I have come to a point in my life where I am stuck with the feeling that I am being judged no matter what I do. To give a little insight on my upbringing and current situation, I was raised in a religious household, dragged to church every Sunday morning, night, and most Wednesday nights. Through these experiences I remember a threat that was held over my head throughout childhood. Something along the lines of if I don't do right by the Lord I'm going to hell. This has put me in a position where I don't want anything to do with religion because I feel like no matter what I do I will be judged, but as I've taken time and given myself space away from that subject I don't feel any better. There is still something in the back of my mind that says ""watch out serious platypus, you don't want to end up in hell."" This judgment comes from everywhere whether or not it is actually true is a different story.

I know a lack of self-esteem can be a major cause of this as well as social anxiety which is something that I have been diagnosed with. I've been speaking to my therapist about this situation as well, and today I was requested to seek out answers from somewhere online. Reddit is the first place I thought about going because my name is obviously not Serious Platypus so it is a little easier to open up here. 

  
I've always wanted to know what I want to do with my life, since Elementary school if I remember right. The early years were so exciting because I would share my writing with anybody and everybody who wanted to read what I've created. These experiences grew, and as I fought through the troubles of childhood, clinging on to writing I eventually came to a point that sent me on a downward spiral...

I remember the day that my passion for letting people read what I have written was stopped dead in it's tracks. As childish as it sounds, there was a girl in school that liked, and she wanted me to write something for her. So I did. After school that day she read what I wrote, and ripped it up in front of me and just dropped it like it was nothing. I feel like my confidence in writing and self esteem in general was crushed at that point, and ever since then (it's been a while) I've been struggling with putting words on paper that I am proud of, or that I feel like won't get torn up in front of my eyes. But here I am reaching out for help.

How do I rekindle my self-esteem and not feel like I am being judged at every corner of my life? And most importantly, how do I reignite the passion that I once had instead of just sitting around and waiting for the end. I know I have just written a lot, but I feel like I am in the bottom of a well trying to climb out with no rope or footholds.

"Feeling lonely, depressed, and with intrusive thoughts about the past",1,1.0,"I grew up in an abusive household. My father for sure is a narcissist. I put up with a lot during my childhood and eventually realized that my only way out was college. When time to apply to colleges arrived, I applied to universities that were far away from home. I did not have any support from family members from the moment I moved away for college. Not once did my parents or any family members visited me in college. I recently graduated from professional school and only a friend went to my graduation.

While I have been able to get ahead educationally and likely have a successful career ahead of me, I feel like emotionally I am in shambles. It's difficult to see my friends and peers being so close with their families while I don't have anyone to rely on. While I have friends, I am an introvert and easily mistrust other people. The only semblance of a stable family I ever had was my ex-spouse's. We got together when we were undergrads and split up about two years ago. While my ex has their own share of problems, they put up with my lack of trust for many years, which undoubtedly had a negative impact on the relationship. I've been to therapy and worked through those issues. However, no matter how much I accomplish in life, I feel pretty unfulfilled and lonely, in great part because of the void of not having family members who truly care about me.

Instead, what I have is memories of the abuse. I have only seen my father once since 2010 (and that one time I saw him was only for a couple of hours) but call him occasionally. Whenever I bring up the abuse, he either says he doesn't remember or says something like, ""if you are still resentful about the past, free to pretend I don't exist. What happened to you is nothing compared to what I went through as a child.""

On the ouside I seem like a person who is put together and who has a brilliant life ahead of them, but inside I am in constant agony. I also have dreadful thoughts (like, if something happened to me I would be completely on my own). I am on meds and have been to therapy for years. I have seen some improvement, but all these issues are still pretty much there.

"Girlfriend sleepwalking, tryed to run away at night, what should i do? ",0,0.5,"My girlfriend f24 told me she is sleepwalking at night sometimes, but i never experienced it before. The relationship is still new and we are on holiday together right now. So i just experienced it for the first time and don't know how to react. 

We were sleeping cuddled together in bed,  i woke up because my arm fell asleep from cuddeling so i tryed to move it. 

That startled her. She jumped up from bed, made loud noises that were not understandable, but she clearly panicked and ran to the door. To note, this all happened in 1-2 seconds, very fast. She was 100% sleeping and not moving at all before this happened. 

I was shocked myself and didn't understand what is going on and how to react at first. I catched her before she left the hotelroom and tryed to calm her down. First she tryed to fight me but she quickly calmed down and fell asleep immidiatly again.

Today i talked with her about this and she can not remember anything but she had a similair thing happen to her in the past, one time she tryed to run to the forest in the middle of the night but her mom catched her before she left the property of their house. 

Can this be a mental condition? How should i handle this?

I didn't expect her to really try to run all of a sudden, if she really leave the hotelroom it will be difficult to find her, espescially when I am asleep when this happens the next time. i think it will also be dangerouse for herself since she don't remember anything, maybe she will run on a busy street or get lost in a foregin country. 

I think she has some other mental problems too, but i still did not confirm them.  One of them is probably an eating disorder since she feels stomach ache every time she eats a little more food. But she eats very little food all the time, it is impossible to feel full with this, she is also very skinny and underweight.

"I'm so lost and so tired, it's hard to do anything. (SA, SH, attempted suicide)",1,0.99,"I've been struggling with depression since I was thirteen. I was abused by my brother up until I was 12 and started fighting back. I lost my great grandmother, my parent, from cancer 3 years ago, and everything has gone to hell since. I tried to kill myself due to her husband being horrible to me and doing a mess of weird things. I 'ran away' to a friend's house to get away from him, there I got assaulted repeatedly for the two weeks I was there. 

I was forced back home after that and a few months later it actually clicked that what had happened was rape. I tried reporting him, hiss word against mine, nothing happened. Then December of 22 my great grandma's husband molested me in my sleep. I left. Stayed with a friend for a month, then lived with my sister from January of last year until July. There, I watched and heard her and her husband argue all day, even in front of their child who wasn't even 2 yet. She wound up physically hurting him and then she left.

I have not had an easy life, I have a lot of trauma, a few mental illnesses, and some physical problems.

I can't afford driving school, I can't afford new clothes, I can't afford to get my ged, the only reason I can get food is through food stamps. I'm also technically homeless, living with my bf and a friend while me and my bf look for places, and we can barely afford rent on any of them and this is super hard.

I'm trying to get SSI, which will probably take forever.

I don't have money, I can't get a job, I live in a basement and an hardly able to go outside without a cane due to being in constant pain.

"Feeling lonely, depressed, and with intrusive thoughts about the past",1,1.0,"I grew up in an abusive household. My father for sure is a narcissist. I put up with a lot during my childhood and eventually realized that my only way out was college. When time to apply to colleges arrived, I applied to universities that were far away from home. I did not have any support from family members from the moment I moved away for college. Not once did my parents or any family members visited me in college. I recently graduated from professional school and only a friend went to my graduation.

While I have been able to get ahead educationally and likely have a successful career ahead of me, I feel like emotionally I am in shambles. It's difficult to see my friends and peers being so close with their families while I don't have anyone to rely on. While I have friends, I am an introvert and easily mistrust other people. The only semblance of a stable family I ever had was my ex-spouse's. We got together when we were undergrads and split up about two years ago. While my ex has their own share of problems, they put up with my lack of trust for many years, which undoubtedly had a negative impact on the relationship. I've been to therapy and worked through those issues. However, no matter how much I accomplish in life, I feel pretty unfulfilled and lonely, in great part because of the void of not having family members who truly care about me.

Instead, what I have is memories of the abuse. I have only seen my father once since 2010 (and that one time I saw him was only for a couple of hours) but call him occasionally. Whenever I bring up the abuse, he either says he doesn't remember or says something like, ""if you are still resentful about the past, free to pretend I don't exist. What happened to you is nothing compared to what I went through as a child.""

On the ouside I seem like a person who is put together and who has a brilliant life ahead of them, but inside I am in constant agony. I also have dreadful thoughts (like, if something happened to me I would be completely on my own). I am on meds and have been to therapy for years. I have seen some improvement, but all these issues are still pretty much there.

I turned to social media hoping to find a sense of acceptance and belonging, thinking it would provide a great opportunity to socialize. However, I noticed that people I interacted with online would unfollow or unfriend me without any apparent reason. This made me realize that I will never be liked or accepted. This realization has had a horrible impact on my mental health.

Am I normal?,1,0.67,"I have been feeling a lot of different things for a while and I want an explanation or something to look into but feel clueless. Thats why im making this post in hopes someone can give me something to look into, im gonna just write down a lot of stuff ive been feeling and maybe it will mean something and maybe it won’t im not sure, thanks anyways! 

I don’t know a lot of family history, but my grandpa has an unexplained nerve issue, and my mom has MS.

-I prefer to be alone and often lack energy for social interaction. My relationships are usually strong for a week or two before I ghost people. It’s not that I don’t want to maintain them; I just struggle to do so, and I avoid people to prevent hurting them.
-I feel like I have a hard time talking about how I feel to an extreme
-I CANT CONCENTRATE AT ALL IT SUCKS!
-I kind of have like a phobia of people or social situations
-I don’t have much enjoyment in anything anymore, even things I used to love like video games.
-I’m incredibly anxious about everything and avoid important life events due to fear of embarrassment.
-I have MDD, which likely explains my lack of energy and negative mood. Despite sleeping 8-14 hours, I wake up feeling exhausted and want to sleep again like right after.
-I have problems with memory, I always forget important stuff unless I write stuff down 50 times and screenshot it and make it my wallpaper I won’t remember it. It took me until I was 18 to remember my parent’s birthdays for example. I don’t even know my cousins names even after repetitive reminding.
-I feel awkward talking, I never feel comfortable doing so and I can never get to the point I want to, I feel like I always take a side road that is wayyy longer to get to the point filled with nonsense. 
-My motivation varies greatly, affecting my academic success and daily activities. I can go from motivated to wanting to stay in bed indefinitely very quickly.
-I neglect self-care, such as brushing my teeth, washing my sheets, or cleaning my room, likely due to depression.
-Lately ive felt like there have been bugs in my skin, that’s the best way to describe it. It happens everyday, throughout the day, all day, but its not 100% constant, but I would say its pretty close to constant.
-I feel paranoid, like I’m being watched or that someone is in the room with me, even though I know no one is there. For example I could be on my computer and feel like 100% there is someone behind me about to grab my shoulder even tho logically I know there isn’t but I still have to quickly check to make sure.
-Sometimes, when walking around my house, I feel like someone might jump out at me or attack me, even though I know it’s irrational.
-sometimes I could be like filling up water in the kitchen and hear and feel someone walking behind me so I turn around and no one is there, this doesn’t happen super often but when it does it’s weird.",mentalhealth,Admirable_Heart4496,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1df41ij/am_i_normal/,0,1.4925373134328357,0.4925373134328357,3.181880286336134e-06,"['feeling', 'lot', 'different', 'thing', 'want', 'explanation', 'something', 'look', 'feel', 'clueless', 'thats', 'im', 'making', 'post', 'hope', 'someone', 'give', 'something', 'look', 'im', 'gon', 'na', 'write', 'lot', 'stuff', 'ive', 'feeling', 'maybe', 'mean', 'something', 'maybe', 'im', 'sure', 'thanks', 'anyways', 'know', 'lot', 'family', 'history', 'grandpa', 'unexplained', 'nerve', 'issue', 'mom', 'prefer', 'alone', 'often', 'lack', 'energy', 'social', 'interaction', 'relationship', 'usually', 'strong', 'week', 'two', 'ghost', 'people', 'want', 'maintain', 'struggle', 'avoid', 'people', 'prevent', 'hurting', 'feel', 'like', 'hard', 'time', 'talking', 'feel', 'extreme', 'cant', 'concentrate', 'suck', 'kind', 'like', 'phobia', 'people', 'social', 'situation', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'anything', 'anymore', 'even', 'thing', 'used', 'love', 'like', 'video', 'game', 'incredibly', 'anxious', 'everything', 'avoid', 'important', 'life', 'event', 'due', 'fear', 'embarrassment', 'mdd', 'likely', 'explains', 'lack', 'energy', 'negative', 'mood', 'despite', 'sleeping', 'hour', 'wake', 'feeling', 'exhausted', 'want', 'sleep', 'like', 'right', 'problem', 'memory', 'always', 'forget', 'important', 'stuff', 'unless', 'write', 'stuff', 'time', 'screenshot', 'make', 'wallpaper', 'remember', 'took', 'remember', 'parent', 'birthday', 'example', 'even', 'know', 'cousin', 'name', 'even', 'repetitive', 'reminding', 'feel', 'awkward', 'talking', 'never', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'never', 'get', 'point', 'want', 'feel', 'like', 'always', 'take', 'side', 'road', 'wayyy', 'longer', 'get', 'point', 'filled', 'nonsense', 'motivation', 'varies', 'greatly', 'affecting', 'academic', 'success', 'daily', 'activity', 'go', 'motivated', 'wanting', 'stay', 'bed', 'indefinitely', 'quickly', 'neglect', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'washing', 'sheet', 'cleaning', 'room', 'likely', 'due', 'depression', 'ive', 'felt', 'like', 'bug', 'skin', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'happens', 'everyday', 'throughout', 'day', 'day', 'constant', 'would', 'say', 'pretty', 'close', 'constant', 'feel', 'paranoid', 'like', 'watched', 'someone', 'room', 'even', 'though', 'know', 'one', 'example', 'could', 'computer', 'feel', 'like', 'someone', 'behind', 'grab', 'shoulder', 'even', 'tho', 'logically', 'know', 'still', 'quickly', 'check', 'make', 'sure', 'walking', 'around', 'house', 'feel', 'like', 'someone', 'might', 'jump', 'attack', 'even', 'though', 'know', 'irrational', 'could', 'like', 'filling', 'water', 'kitchen', 'hear', 'feel', 'someone', 'walking', 'behind', 'turn', 'around', 'one', 'happen', 'super', 'often', 'weird']","{'neg': 0.169, 'neu': 0.676, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': -0.8765}",negative

What is cyber/gangstalking?,1,1.0,"Context: I am Canadian, and for those of whom are living outside of Canada, we are implementing a rather dubious and cynical practice called “M.A.I.D.”. Medical Assistance In Dying.

A friend of mine who I’ve not spoken to since high school has been dealing with what he calls Gang Stalking or Cyber Stalking. It is essentially the belief that he is living the life of Jim Carey in the movie The Truman Show. The belief that everyone is an actor and all interactions are tests performed by a powerful entity.

He fantasizes of MAID but is currently unable to receive it because it’s not outlined in law that people with this mental illness are eligible for it.
———————————

Question #1 : How should I (or anyone) deal with someone who is exhibiting this illness? 

I have already told him that I am on the side him, the part that is aimed up, so I will not rally for amendments with MAID (I would not rally for it for anyone. No one should have a ‘compassionate killing from the government’).

Question #2 : (context) He is also atheistic, which I also was for 15 years, but I’ve come to learn that reality isn’t only made up of facts and matter, but also how to act in the world. What is the world made of vs how to act in the world. He has done something that strongly goes against the moral order (not murder, but I should not share) which I feel he is having a hard time processing as he does not have and has not had the proper moral framework to deal with the evils of the world and within each person individually, including himself. 

(Question) Does the lack of a moral order outside of one’s self create the environment where you could be subject to an OCD/Bipolar/Schizophrenic state? Due to the fact that it can be absolutely terrifying to realize the evil capacity within one’s self? As opposed to the atheist claim along the lines of ‘we’re all basically good, just be good and everything will be alright’.

This doesn’t make sense to me,1,1.0,"My former therapist basically described to me that, without meds, me trying to better myself is the equivalent of ‘trying to swim to shore with only one available arm.” Like, as I interpret it, its very VERY difficult to do. Still doable, but barely. He was making it sound like it’s nearly an impossible feat to better myself without meds. 
If this is the case, then why was he still basically pushing the idea of me bettering myself on my own? Like he was telling me to go to IOP and work on myself there. Without meds basically. But didn’t he just tell me that bettering myself without meds is very hard? If so then why are all these professionals downplaying meds so much when someone like me clearly needs them AND therapy (trust me, if you knew me, you’d know I need a boost from meds to be able to better myself. That’s how badly I’m doing with my mental health). 

Maybe he encouraged me to do IOP even without meds because he was able to do it himself. But my problems seem to be more complex than his were before he was able to better himself. I mean I have BPD ok? He didn’t.

I've been riddled with guilt and feeling terrible about myself.,1,1.0,"My mental health is really up and down at the minute. I've got a 5 month old baby, and my mother recently passed away which could be contributing, but Ive been obsessing over guilty thoughts of basically all the bad things I've ever done and feel like  a terrible person. 
The main thing I'm obsessing over which causes me great shame and guilt is from a couple of years ago. In work (while in my current relationship, we have 2 kids together) I became quite infatuated with a colleague who is married. One day he held the lift for me and called me over. I thought nobody was around, and there was definitely some flirtatious body language and eye contact between us. It would have looked like we were about to kiss if someone saw us. It turns out someone did and he used every occasion since to make thinly veiled comments about it and it was clear he was trying to makee feel ashamed and for all I know he thinks we were having some kind of affair. The man involved started receiving these comments too from the other colleague, and became very hostile towards me and then moved to another team. I feel so dreadful and idiotic about the whole thing and I feel like I've gotten mysef a reputation as some sort of dangerous homewrecker, though I have no evidence anyone has been gossiping about it. I wish I could go back and change my interaction with him that day. I've never cheated in my life and it would never have come to that. I suppose I was just in need of some male attention as things were up and down with my partner at times, but we're in such a good place now. He supported me through losing my mum, was my rock, and we have another child together since. But the regret is eating me up and I'm wrried gossip has spread and will affect my career the rest of my life.

I’m so depressed I have no motivation to eat,3,1.0,"Sorry for the long post, it’s mostly me ranting about my life. I could really use someone to talk to.


I’m going through the worst part of my life. My boyfriend who I have an extremely strong relationship with has decided to go into the military. His training is 8 months long, I got to see him 2 months in and then 4 months in, but now the last 4 I won’t see him at all. I can’t even speak to him because he’s not allowed his phone. I’ve had severe attachment issues my whole life and have probably cried a total of imma say 100 hours over this. I used to have really bad panic attacks. 

Found out a few months after my boyfriend left that my only grandparent, that I’m close with suddenly has stage 4 lung cancer and has 3 months left to live. She was in remission and considered cancer free last summer and then bam. She’s going downhill so fast, they just put her on the oxygen mask and it’s terrifying. This is the first death I will have to deal with ever and I don’t know how I’m going to get through it without my person with me. 

A few weeks ago I stopped being friends with my only friend because she hasn’t given me any support whatsoever in the past 4 months. I have to beg her to hangout with me even though she’s my literal next door neighbour. On top of that I work 50 hours a week and she works 15 and yet she can’t find time for me. 

I live with my two sisters, niece, and mom. My one sister which is my best friend works the opposite shift as me so we don’t see eachother at all, only on weekends. I get off late and when I get home everyone’s usually asleep or too tired to spend time with me. I’m constantly alone. I have no one to text, and can’t make friends that I feel comfortable with. I just hate people and always feel judged so I don’t like letting people in, I’ve also never met anyone other than my partner that GENUINELY is interested in me as a person and deeply cares for me. I just miss him so much. 

And the cherry on top is how much I hate my fucking job but can’t leave it because I won’t get the kind of pay I do anywhere else. I work so far from home and am constantly gone, when I’m home I deprive myself of basic needs such as eating because I don’t want to waste my free time, I’m also chronically lazy. If I didn’t have to look presentable for work I’d probably shower once a week. I also rarely have an appetite and actually have a hard time eating in general because I’m always running on empty. I usually eat once every two days, I try to go for atleast once a day which is good for me but only if it’s a full meal, which it usually isn’t. 

I’m not constantly sad, but everytime I’m alone and have time to think, I am. Even the small things like how I’m too lazy to eat make me extra sad because it feels pathetic. And just extremely depressing. I’ve lost 20 pounds since my boyfriend left. I honestly just want someone to talk to me and try to support me and maybe give me some ideas on how to get my shit together. Even if you can’t give me any help/advice, support would be nice. I honestly even feel pathetic posting this because I know what I’m going through isn’t that bad, but I just genuinely have no one to talk to and really needed to type it all out for someone to read and understand. There’s honestly so much more but I’d probably end up writing an essay so I’m gonna stop here.

This is just upsetting at this point,1,1.0,"I don't even know where to start. The constant physical discomfort is driving me crazy.

I found out my childhood was worse than I thought,3,1.0,"So, for context I'm in therapy currently to figure out what my deal is.

He suggested I ask family that does remember.

I asked my older sister and, wow is it worse than i thought. She's always been very narcissistic, and emotionally neglectful from what I do remember. I learned more though.

My sister said as a young kid, she never told us she loved us, she never hugged us, she was never there. My sister was the one changing my diapers and cooking me meals because our mother was out drinking or doing whatever. She had major anger issues, always lashed out at us. She cheated on every man she was with, always focused on herself or the men in her life instead of us. She would leave us alone for days at a time to fend for ourselves.

Why is it so hard to take my medications?,1,1.0,"Hi, 23F. I've been diagnosed with PDD and GAD for about 8 years now. 

Just wanted to ask if it's normal to have such a hard time taking my meds. Nothing physical, but it's more like I don't have the will for it?

Thought I witnessed my cat die,1,1.0,"I was coming home late from the gym the other night, and saw a fox biting on a cat in the middle of the road , so ran over and scared the fox off. Looked down and noticed  (at that moment) it was my cat. Neck sliced and blood pouring out, motionless but she was still warm. It was around midnight, and so nobody was around, and I didn't know what to do. I felt myself start to tear up, gently stroking her, apologising for not getting there quicker, apologising for not letting her on my lap the previous day. She looked so defenseless and harmless laying there, and it didn't make sense that something so cute and harmless had such a violent exit in the world. I started to cry, because of what she went through, and how guilty I felt, and how much is will hurt my family when I tell them. 
I stood over her, diverting the odd car that came by. Some people stopped and asked, I answered, and they showed compassion, and I felt bad that they felt bad they couldn't 'help'.
After about 15 minutes standing over her in the rain, I mustered up the courage to take my jumper off and pick her up to carry her home. 
After a few attempts, and constantly muttering 'sorry' to her, I carried her back home. She was the daughter of our older cat, and I was terrified to go into the house and bring this news. 
I went in, went upstairs and woke my parents up as I didn't know what to do, through whimpers and light cries, I told them I found her dead on the street (all whilst holding her in the dark in my arms). They were obviously confused and upset, and we went downstairs, only to find my cat by the backdoor- pawing to get out. I realised I had brought a random dead cat home. Laughing, crying, confused, angry, stunned. I was feeling everything. 
Very fortunate that it was not my cat, but very sorry that it was someone else's. 
I had felt like I had to go through the stages of grief just to pick her up and carry her home and move forwards, only to find out that it wasn't my cat. 

After calming down, and questioning whether I'm an idiot for not recognising it wasn't my cat, I showed a picture to my family, and they were all certain they would have mistaken her for our cat aswell. 

I didnt realise I felt so strongly for my pet. I knew I cared and loved her etc, but it was a large shock to what extent. Perhaps it was the situation that made it worse. 

This happend 3 days ago, and still I don't feel emotionally back to normal. 
I kept telling myself when I was out there in the road, trying to pick her up, that it's 'just a cat', 'just pick her up', 'stop being overdramatic and just do it, you can't leave her out here'. 

Don't really know why I'm posting it here, but it was just such a huge emotional roller coaster, and I just needed to vent it.

Okay so now I am starting to get concerned. ,1,1.0,"I have a habit of instilling fear on my own for the things I cannot get. Growing up, I was always adjusting to everyone and aside from food, clothes and school, I don't have anything. Basically, I don't have any priorities like my peers.

Since I desire something very rarely, the one I had in mind will be so intense that I can't even stop thinking about it. Just as simple as getting a new sandal, i can't get one because I have to convince my dad for it when he just thinks in a different way about it. I became an alien in my school because of how different was I am.  So from young, when it becomes clear that I am not getting whatever my classmates or friends get, I began to instill fear on my own to the things because I couldn't cope up. Now I am starting to realise that I haven't lived for my own happiness for a MOMENT ! 

My dad is always sick and won't leave bed (due to stress of course) and all I can do is waiting and waiting and when I get really sad about it, I just give up. Because if i fight over it, he won't get up for another 2 months coz my words hurt him.

Was I wrong for telling my doctor I have an eating disorder?,1,1.0,"Hello everybody,

So today I had a doctors appointment to re- go over some labs that had been ongoing on in attempts to get my hypothyroidism under control, as well as my high cholesterol. My doctor originally sent me a referral to a nutritionist, who I met up with to discuss a plan of action. I left the nutritionist appointment feeling highly discouraged and overall, checked out. During this appointment I discussed with the nutritionist that I would mainly like to focus on disordered eating, and focusing on eating more protein and getting into a better food routine. The nutritionist stated that disordered eating ""Was all in your head"" and then proceeded to focus on dieting to lose weight, which I told them, I wanted my interest to be on eating healthier, not losing weight. I told my primary doctor about this, and my concerns about having an eating disorder. She asked what eating disorder I had and told her I had binge eating disorder, and told her I was unable to work on it further because of the pandemic, and because I was recieving free therapy through my college, I was taken off the list because I was not actively suicidal. What I did not tell my doctor, was that I originally started seeing a therapist for high anxiety and depression, and that the topic of body dismorphia and eating disorders came up later, and briefly because the pandemic started in the following weeks. I was not formally diagnosed for anything, but my therapist and psychiatrist were pushing for depression and anxiety meds. In terms of having an eating disorder,  this is something I've been struggling with since I was 12 years old. Was I in the wrong for doing this? Am I faking an eating disorder? Should I have pushed for a formal diagnosis?

What does it mean to “work on yourself”,1,1.0,"I (22m) have recently agreed with my partner who is currently travelling for 6 months that we need a break. We have lived together during a stressful time in our life where we both have lots going on independently. 
We love each other deeply and it hurts the both of us to say we need a break - but right now we do. We both have agreed that we might reconcile when she’s back and give it another go (only if things are right and life allows us to)

Many aspects of my life are a mess. In fact most of it is currently is. I want to change myself for the better, genuinely for me. And if I want any chance of maintaining positive relationships with the people I love, I also need to do this. 

I’m currently unemployed which has been difficult for the last few months - but I have studied for the last 5 years and have a degree and currently figuring employment/my career out. 
My mental health at the moment feels damaged - I have bad habits, I’m going round in circles every day doing the same thing and nothing changes. I get to the end of the day and feel awful for it. 
Because we are apart, and because I have a lot of time in my hands I figured that the time to start working on myself is NOW. 

But my question is - HOW? What does it look like to “work on yourself”? What does it entail and what does it involve me actually doing for myself?
People always give the advice of “you need to work on yourself” but never discuss the how’s of it. 

All suggestions are welcome… what did you do to work on yourself during your toughest times alone?

Dealing with Anxiety,2,1.0,"Hi everyone,  
Lately, I've been feeling really anxious and confused about my sexual identity. I want to make it clear that I am absolutely sure I am straight. I've never felt attracted to men emotionally or sexually, and I can't imagine holding hands with or kissing another man.  
But even with this certainty, my mind keeps telling me that people around me might think I'm gay, especially since I'm naturally shy, quiet, and very soft-spoken guy. This anxiety makes me feel very awkward in social situations. Sometimes, I also notice people looking at me strangely, and it happens quite frequently, as if they're thinking, ""What's wrong with this guy?""  


I can't afford therapy right now, so I'm hoping to get some advice and support here.

I can’t hold down a job,5,1.0,"I have always been a “gifted kid” and I have heard all about gifted kid burnout, but I feel like such a complete failure, it can’t be normal.

I graduated from college in 2023 and since then things have just gone downhill. I got a great job at a school in a big city, lasted a month and a half. Got a job at a doctors office as a receptionist/scheduler, lasted about 5 months. I just left the first day of my new job a couple hours in because I can’t do it. Every time, I left abruptly with no warning and so obviously can’t use those jobs as references.

I just. Can’t. Do. It. I know I’m being childish and stupid and let things get to me too easily. Obviously, almost no one likes their job. But, I don’t know how they then have the ability to know they have to get up, day after day, and go do something they can’t look forward to. 

I’ve tried looking online for ways to help, but a lot of them are “set goals.” I am always able to talk myself out of goals. I either say they are unreasonable, or that I can get them some other way.

how to stop genuinely caring what other people think,1,0.67,"I am having a hard time to really not care about what other people think of me - or what I believe other people think about me. To be clear, I am not speaking about situations or aspects where it would be 'normal' to care what other people think (in the sense that almost every human being would care).

Instead, I am speaking about situations where another person's opinion 'shouldn't' matter. E.g. if I have a hobby, I am afraid other people think I suck at it. Due to this, I am afraid to e.g. play an instrument in front of other people, because I am afraid they will judge me. If I imagine this judgement, I also ruminate about it and feel anxious / like a loser.

Another example: I don't get along with my coworkers so well and really don't like them (among others because they make racist and homophobic remarks, but also because we don't match in terms of age and lifestyle). Due to this, I keep to myself at work. Especially the nasty remarks make it feel 'unsafe' to self-disclose around them, as I have a history of being bullied. Still, despite the fact that I don't like them and also see them as pathetic, I still worry about their opinion a lot - e.g. that they think I am an awkward loser without social skills.

And the other students were simply partying all time, and I focused on my studies double time, because I didn't do really anything else than learning and project works. So is it really considered as a big success?

**Career:**

Positive:

I have achieved a lot of my childhood dreams. I could do jobs, which I never thought I would really do. I know very few can even enter these kind of jobs remotely, and I could do remote works for places and companies I would never think I will. And I don't think I would starve at any time.

Negative:

During my whole 8 years of career, I was fired 3 times for low performance. It was shocking, I never saw these before, and I thought I did everything I could. I loved 2 jobs out of these 3. This is my biggest pain, because I felt some kind of success in my studies, and I thought my efforts will pay off. These happened while firing 1 other person as well in both places out of the 3. But still, I received that negative feedback in both places. Although I'm I really don't want to switch careers or learn something entirely different. And I feel its not arguable at all. I already thought about that, but I just can't switch. I know people who were never fired in their career. Why to be happy for a hardly-reachable job for many, if I lose that in a relatively short time?

**Relationships:**

Positive:

I had a happy 2 year long relationship without any arguments. I also had some shorter ones. All happened with some women I considered like top models, I loved them.

Negative:

The 2 year long could exist only because of the COVID. There wasn't any dating during that time, and when it finished, she just left me. And there's a woman, who literally hates me. I didn't know for a long time, how to react to some situations, and I tried to joke with sensitive topics, etc. I'm already over 30, and I had never have any wife or kids. I know people who could be in a relationship in their entire life. Then why to be happy about this?

So is it a success or a failure? Objectively, where can I be in my life? Am I progressing well? Am I behind most of the people? Is there anything, which is critically bad, and should be fixed ASAP, because later there will be some big issues I don't see now?",mentalhealth,RandomDoctor2,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1detzc4/how_to_process_my_failures_if_these_are_really/,0,2.0,0.0,4.26371958369042e-06,"['hi', 'issue', 'complex', 'sometimes', 'ca', 'decide', 'cool', 'rockstar', 'complete', 'failure', 'see', 'situation', 'bright', 'way', 'well', 'see', 'life', 'complete', 'opposite', 'way', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'failure', 'reality', 'least', 'really', 'successful', 'life', 'know', 'reality', 'really', 'complete', 'failure', 'fix', 'stuff', 'quickly', 'something', 'even', 'worse', 'would', 'happen', 'everything', 'perfect', 'way', 'please', 'help', 'see', 'situation', 'clearly', 'study', 'positive', 'university', 'achieved', 'lot', 'award', 'fame', 'glory', 'teacher', 'praised', 'invited', 'meeting', 'leadership', 'university', 'along', 'student', 'etc', 'received', 'national', 'golden', 'medal', 'well', 'competition', 'negative', 'pretty', 'small', 'university', 'entered', 'university', 'state', 'study', 'student', 'simply', 'partying', 'time', 'focused', 'study', 'double', 'time', 'really', 'anything', 'else', 'learning', 'project', 'work', 'really', 'considered', 'big', 'success', 'career', 'positive', 'achieved', 'lot', 'childhood', 'dream', 'could', 'job', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'really', 'know', 'even', 'enter', 'kind', 'job', 'remotely', 'could', 'remote', 'work', 'place', 'company', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'think', 'would', 'starve', 'time', 'negative', 'whole', 'year', 'career', 'fired', 'time', 'low', 'performance', 'shocking', 'never', 'saw', 'thought', 'everything', 'could', 'loved', 'job', 'biggest', 'pain', 'felt', 'kind', 'success', 'study', 'thought', 'effort', 'pay', 'happened', 'firing', 'person', 'well', 'place', 'still', 'received', 'negative', 'feedback', 'place', 'although', 'really', 'want', 'switch', 'career', 'learn', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'feel', 'arguable', 'already', 'thought', 'ca', 'switch', 'know', 'people', 'never', 'fired', 'career', 'happy', 'job', 'many', 'lose', 'relatively', 'short', 'time', 'relationship', 'positive', 'happy', 'year', 'long', 'relationship', 'without', 'argument', 'also', 'shorter', 'one', 'happened', 'woman', 'considered', 'like', 'top', 'model', 'loved', 'negative', 'year', 'long', 'could', 'exist', 'covid', 'dating', 'time', 'finished', 'left', 'woman', 'literally', 'hate', 'know', 'long', 'time', 'react', 'situation', 'tried', 'joke', 'sensitive', 'topic', 'etc', 'already', 'never', 'wife', 'kid', 'know', 'people', 'could', 'relationship', 'entire', 'life', 'happy', 'success', 'failure', 'objectively', 'life', 'progressing', 'well', 'behind', 'people', 'anything', 'critically', 'bad', 'fixed', 'asap', 'later', 'big', 'issue', 'see']","{'neg': 0.115, 'neu': 0.677, 'pos': 0.208, 'compound': 0.9966}",positive
I miss high school so much that it’s making me depressed. ,1,1.0,"Throwaway bc I’m embarrassed.

I’ve been out of high school for over a full year now. Coming up in august it’ll be 2 years since i started my senior year.

For most of my school experience, I was in a small private school, up until my 8th grade year, when we switched to home schooling. We only did that for one year, as it wasn’t really for us. 

The year that followed, my freshman year, I was sent to public school. I didn’t really feel like i fit in there, and wasn’t sure what to do. Then, Covid happened. We were all stuck at home, which wasn’t too hard for me to handle. I spent my Sophomore year at home as well. 

My Junior year was different. I decided to enroll in a career-based school that puts you in classes depending on the job you wanted to do later in life. I decided to go into the graphic design path. There, I finally found my people. Everyone was friends, everyone was so nice. I have never felt so included and comfortable in my entire life. I met some amazing people, and made some amazing friends. That year is the absolute highlight for me. I even met a wonderful girl.

That girl and I started dating towards the end of the year, and that summer was spent hanging out with her and friends nearly daily. It was so perfect. I miss it so much. 

Later on that summer, things sort of fell apart a little. The girl and I broke up. That destroyed me. One of my best friends moved to Florida. That destroyed me too. I have never really fully recovered from that breakup I don’t think. I still think about her all the time, even though it’s been nearly 2 years. 

Senior year wasn’t as fun. I spent most of my time longing for her, hoping for a second chance. It almost happened too.. but it fell right through my fingers. 

Now, I’m almost 20, and I absolutely do not know how to get over this. I’m miserable.

I was molested by a family member,1,1.0,"Even before I started writing here today, I thought to myself, ""I must be a cornball type of guy"" just because I wanted to anonymously get something off my chest. There's a pattern like this, with all my thoughts, that I have been seeing a lot lately. 

  
I honestly don't know where to start with this post so I'm just gonna start at my earliest memories.

When I was around 5 years old, I stayed with an immediate family member. A whole lot of my family was there,  I could never name off everyone. This made things especially challenging after all these years, because instead of having 1 person I can cast blame on, I only have ambiguity. There were many, and multiple people, who hurt me as well as others.

I have this early memory of being with my Older brother, well call him BOOF. Boof and I were always so energetic and happy when we were young, jumping into pools n shit. One day, we were next to some shed on the same property where I remember my cousin performing sexual acts on both of us, while being guided by an adult. To this day, neither me nor boof can remember who this adult is. I suppose it is for the best, because getting away with murder doesn't sound ideal. Well, me and boof endured this and have talked only once in our lives about it. 

I reluctantly brought it up one time, about 5 or so years ago, and he just told me he swore it was a dream. He said theres no way it could've happened. After explaining I endured the same thing as well as saw him there, in the fucked up position, we both agreed to NOT talk about it ever again with anybody. 

Well today, I'm coming out. I did already tell my spouse. He is very supportive about it as well. Boof will not discuss it for a while I'm afraid, unless he told his gf behind closed doors. We are very similar in this way, so its very likely.

As grotesque as the memories are, theres a lot of weird twists and turns that come up when I reflect. Sure, I could get mad at my cousin, but it would be pointless. She was around the same age as me and was just following what fucked up instructions she had received from some fucked up relative. There was a court case that I recently learned about that involved my favorite uncle, but he was proven innocent somehow. All I have is pain, exhaustion, and questions which will never be answered.

Sorry if I'm rambling, its just that I heard if I share my story, the pain might start decreasing more.

"I Do Everything For My Mental Health, But Still Depressed - Why?",1,0.67,"Hi all,

For a good number of years now, I have struggled with continuous, albeit moderate, depression. Ever since a break up when I was 18 where I messed things up, that was the first time in my life when I felt properly depressed, and ever since then things just haven't quite been right, despite being completely over the situation and the girl in question (I'm 29 now).

My depression is not the kind that keeps me up all night crying or stops me from eating, but just a constant low mood that stops me from enjoying life or being excited at anything. I have ADHD as well, which doesn't help matters when it comes to motivation.

That being said, I do absolutely everything to help my mental health:

* I practise yoga
* eat healthily (vegetarian for 4 years, but supplement with B12, Iron, D, Omega 3, etc)
* avoid ultra processed foods (80-90% of my diet is natural foods)
* Take a probiotic daily
* run 50km a week
* gym 3 times a week
* avoid pornography
* healthy sex life
* Walks with my dog twice a day
* Reducing caffeine consumption to minimal amounts
* Counselling (this didn't help, however, because I had no trauma or 'bad thoughts' to discuss. I'm just low)
* Socialise with friends at my running club
* Journaling positivity and achievements of the day
* TDCS Headset Use - Day 6 so far

People on the internet need to understand this one thing,3,0.8,"You can hop on reddit, get on a burner account, and wreak absolute havoc with zero repercussions. 

You can respond to someone’s post about how they want to off themself and decide to tell them they’re a horrible human being for putting other people through that. 

You can judge someone for using Reddit or the internet as a source of help. 

You can make the conscious decision to bully someone who is at rock bottom. 

It’s so incredibly easy being mean to people you don’t know. You’ll never learn their name, you’ll never see them in person. You’ll never feel the guilt or see their face when they read your disgusting message. 

Like I said, there’s zero repercussions. 

I’ll still never be able to understand why people do it. Why trolls are a thing. Why people find gratification in doing these things. 

We learn to ignore the “internet trolls,” or we hear “don’t let them get to you,” as a response. But we continue to allow it to happen. It’s almost expected of you to just brush off rude comments and you’re weak if you let them get to you. Why is that? How come they don’t put algorithms in play to stop trolling from happening? Bullying on the internet has caused a lot of issues. 

It’s one of the most disgusting things on the planet in my opinion. 

Personally, I’ve reached out for help. Several times. Been at rock bottom, several times. Wanted to off myself, several. times. And every time, I’d get rude comments that just made me want to do it even more. 

One rude comment almost trumps 5 nice ones. And they know that. 

I understand the whole “hurt people hurt people” scenario but damn. I’ll admit it, it gets to me. I get that I’m putting a target on my back by admitting that but nothing will change if I don’t post this. Either way, I’m going to receive hate. 

If you made it all the way down here, thanks for reading what I have to say. I obviously just received some hate and it obviously got to me.

I tried my best comforting him tellin him stuff like : ‘enjoy the family you have bro what if you went missing how would they feel imagine that’ ‘try to push it more’ ‘i pray that this doesnt happen to anyone else’ ‘what if your mom saw what you will acomplish in life how would she feel? She would feel proud( i was unsure to say this one but I said it)’ 

He just kept denying everything I tried to give him reason to live for and told me your the first person I actually opened up like this. He told me that I try to push my sadness when going out with you guys ( me and the 2-3 other friends) .

His situation: He is actually very very smart but because of what happened evrything went downhill for him his grades and stuff ( he was first place in the nation for mathematics at a time).

Absent parent syndrome/idk,0,0.5,"I grew up with my grandparents till I moved to England with my parents. I was nearly 10 when I moved to England. My parents have been working away for first 10 years of my life and I only got to see my mother for two months every year and but I did see my dad a bit more and I liked him growing up and absolutely despised my mother.

My dad retired from the force when I was 6 and I lived with him and my grandparents,  even though he was there he was an absent parent. 

Just reading about absent parent syndrome and as an adult I have all the issues like clinginess, anxiety, jealousy and  fear of abandonment, low self-esteem and always deemed as a bad person for being blunt and saying everything to the face.

I am going to tie the knot soon and I feel like I will fuck up my marriage.

Being my parents not around, my uncles and aunties always put me down to make  me look like I am horrible sibling to my little brother and  a bad kid in the family. 

Even my dad was present in my life from the age of 6 he used to make fun of me Infront of his relatives to make them laugh and never defended me whereas his siblings protected and defended my cousins. I was almost everyones banter donkey and got hate for no reason.

Even writing this getting me teared up and my wedding is around the corner. I burst into tears everytime I get angry and can't control my emotions. My fiancée says it's fine but sometimes I feel like she thinks I am weak, for instance ""she asked me why are you getting emotional and crying"". As a man this hurt me a little as I felt like she's questioning my masculinity.

Resources for to cope with stress addiction? ,1,1.0,"I have recently realized that I am addicted to stress. When I don't have a problem to think about or something to be stressed out over, I feel uncomfortable and bored. And I find myself looking for problems.

Adding a bit about my background just in case this helps give specific suggestions: I grew up being told to work and achieve all the time, and I feel like I essentially have lived in a state of stress my whole life.

How to I go back to being normal?,1,1.0,"My life has been background noise for the last 4 years. I’ve tried asking for help. For a long time now and I’ve been on medicine for a while. I can’t remember much anymore and I’ve forgotten when I started taking them. I have also attempted therapy with 2 separate people. Though my first therapist didn’t last long and my current has only just started helping me. 
What do I need to do? 
I’m currently taking 10 milligrams of buspirone twice a day and 150 mg of Bupropion Hcl xl/Wellbutrin xl. 

I also tried Prozac for a while but I was taken off it. I was bad about not taking my medicine so I may not have allowed myself time to actually try it. Should I ask to try it again? 

I haven’t noticed any meaningful improvement in myself but my doctor said that I’m different. I think I might have misled him. I constantly act like I feel emotion whenever I can. I don’t really have a drive to do so but I just do it habitually. I think I may have started acting differently whenever I came in for a checkup. I don’t know. 

Should I give it more time? Or do I need to tell him. 

I just need to feel something again 

Do I need to reach out to a psychiatrist? 

I can’t tell how severe i really am. It’s been so long since i felt real emotions when I wasn’t high that I don’t know what they feel like. I don’t think I’m addicted to weed.

Depression is such an isolating illness. No one can reach into your head and take the pain away from you. You have to put in the work and save yourself.

Sudden loss of Spirituality? Do i need to worry? ,1,1.0,"Hi, so for context, i have been very spiritual for the past 5 or 6 years. It was a very important part of my everyday life. 
It became much extremer in the past few years. In the beginning i was just doing things like read tarot cards or throw together mahic spells. I actually became quite successful at predicting peoples future and was able to very accurately  and specifically tell people things about themselves i had no way of knowing, without the use of tarot cards. The spells i did oftentimes came true with very high accuracy. 
In the last 2-3 years that became even more extreme. I started sensing things and felt that i had supernatural powers. I ""sensed"" supernatural beings around me, i had a tree send me messages through my mind and lead me to a place through a pendulum that it had previously shown to me through my mind. I was sure there were two spirits watching over me that protected me. I believed that God's were watching over me and sending me signs. And while it may seem strange, these things never really interfered with my life, i didn't tell anyone but my friends about it. So i never thought twice about it.

I wish I was normal,1,1.0,"I was diagnosed with autism at age 2, because of that I had an aide throughout grade school. Couple that to having unsupervised internet access from as young as 5, and I was set to be an outcast. I had a few friends, but I would only see them out of school maybe once a year. Even then I ate alone during lunch because of food sensory issues.

I didn't go to any homecoming or prom events, because I just wanted to stay home and play video games. At the start of high school, I had an okay social life, had some friends I was somewhat close with. But reading through their instagram and seeing them go to Disneyland and the movies and all this awesome shit without inviting me made me feel left out. So out of anger I started making some threats to shoot up the school. After the police came to my house on Christmas Day while extended family was visiting, I was in a psych ward for 3 days.

After the visit I had to meet with the superintendent and ended up having to switch to smaller, more poorly run classes instead of the standard, more populous ones. I lost so many friends after that. I gave up. At least there was the hope of college being better.

I feel like a person with good mental health who’s pretending to be a in a worse state then I am.,1,0.67,"Hey I’m a 15 yr old male who is trying to make sense of the way I’m feeling. I have never really used Reddit but I can’t find anything online to really explain the way I’m feeling and I guess I’m seeking someone who can relate or explain? To be honest I kinda feel like a good person who’s pretending to be worse than I am. For example I convinced my mom to allow me to see a therapist but I find myself feeling like I’m lying to my therapist for no reason. When I originally wanted to go to a therapist, it was because I was cutting myself. Thinking about this I start to wonder if I was just doing it for attention or I just wanted people to see that I was cutting myself. I feel like I’m pretending that I have stronger feelings than I do. The only way I can think of explaining this is kind of a numbness, but I tell people I’m feeling a way that I should be in that scenario. Like when my father went to rehab, I didn’t really care, weirdly enough. But when people asked me, I kind of broke down and cried about it but when I think about it, I don’t know why I did that when I honestly didn’t care I feel like I pretended like that was some thing that affected me very heavily. I guess to say that I have good mental health would be an overstatement in a way because I kind of just feel numb about most things.

My parents are attentive towards my younger sister’s mental health but they ignore mine,1,1.0,"Very sorry for any grammar mistakes. Unfortunately, English isn’t my native language.

My (F18) parents are always so attentive and helpful towards my younger sister and her mental health. Not too long ago, they told me that she had admitted to having a girlfriend. My parents are very religious people which led to them taking this issue very seriously. I won't go into detail regarding the whole ordeal but it was bad. My-sister-tried-to-run-away-from-home bad. My parents decided to bring her to a therapist due to this and other issues. From then on, my sister has been seeing a therapist very frequently. I don't like to boast but I do deem myself as a supportive person and I have been nothing but very helpful regarding the situation wuth my sister.

However, I've been facing a lot of issues for a long time and all l ever wanted was to seek proper help that isn't from a school counsellor who reduces my feelings to typical ""high school girl"" feelings. I just finished my final exam and graduated school which means that appointments won't bother my studying schedule. I wish I could put into words about my issues but l've always found it difficult. What's odd is that my parents acknowledge my severe anxiety and they never fail point it out - along with multiple other problems I face. They mentioned bringing me as they suspect I'm autistic but nothing has been done yet they constantly make jokes on my suspected autism which led me to believe they were simply joking all this while. I'm genuinely clueless and I physically can't bring myself to be vulnerable about this to them or ask them to take me to a psychiatrist. I don't know what to do.

I might've missed out on some things as I wrote on a whim while feeling distressed. Please give me a bit of guidance. I'd really appreciate it.

I feel like I should be greatful for what I have and the opportunities that I’ve been given, but I still want more from life and it’s frustrating.

My work is ok but not in the direction I expect for my career worth.
I’m trying to grow into other areas but feel a little insecure about it (still, pushing thru).
I have a LDR with the person I love and loves my back but damn long distance is so hard sometimes.
I want to emigrate and it’s such a long wait and a difficult process that has more challenges on the other side. 
Jobs are not great. Nothing better than where I currently am.
I struggle to get things done (excersise, hobbies, journaling, outings with friends)
I’ve lost my initiative to connect with ppl at work cause I just want out and they’re all perky and happy (newbies)
I like my country but damn: traffic, pollution, cost of living, insecurity, makes it hard.

I do therapy which helps but I still struggle to see the bright side of it. And when I do, it gets taken by wanting to continuing growing -Aspiring kinda sucks sometimes but you have to keep on going or else you get stuck.

It’s frustrating. I feel like I’m getting mild depression again, fighting my mind to avoid going into the “I just don’t want to wake up tmrrw” or “I wish it would just stop”. I know it comes from feeling overwhelmed. From wishing I hadn’t have all this happening.

I guess besides venting, my question is: what helps you when things around seem so overwhelming?

At times I feel like I can beat it, but then I can’t. To top it off I lost one of the only people I truly ever cared about and valued. 5 months later I haven’t made any progress in grieving. I basically spend every day pushing along. Smiles, jokes, more smiles, acting ambitious until I’m alone, that’s when I feel almost entirely emotionless 90% of the time. That’s what real. It’s the same process every day, until maybe once in a while I can’t bottle it up and it pours out, I have an emotional outburst and then move on and repeat the process. I feel utterly alone and I feel selfish for it. I have a fiancée. I have family that cares for me, I have close friends. But I feel alone still. I feel guilt for that. But after losing my grandpa I feel even more alone. I’m not really entirely sure what I’m doing. It’s like I’m wandering in a void. No sense of direction. Just simply existing. The world we live it makes it worse. It’s fueled by social media influencers, politics, conspiracy theories, hate. I want to feel warmth, to be happy. But I can’t find anything to get that from. I don’t know why I can’t beat this. I don’t even know what I really feel half the time. I guess I just don’t wanna feel so alone anymore. I don’t wanna feel so bad.

Thank you ❤️,1,1.0,"When I first joined this subreddit, my mental health was the lowest it’s ever been. I was struggling with anxiety attacks almost nightly and i spent my waking hours trying to ignore and push away my persistent depressive and suicidal thoughts. I was too scared to ask my parents if these feelings were normal things teenagers experienced so I came here for help.  

I only posted a couple times but the people that responded to my cries for help made me recognize that my feelings were not normal or healthy. Honestly, just receiving your validation made me feel like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I want to thank the people that responded to my posts because without you i don’t know if i would be in the place I am today.  I’m now seeing a therapist that is better equipped to handle my situation, i got on antidepressants, i am now way more open about my mental health with my friends and family, and i feel more comfortable around people in general. From the bottom of my heart i am grateful. You helped me realize that I wasn’t alone❤️

I sob sometimes thinking of the immense potential I had, and how potential only really counts when you’re young.

does anyone else miss lockdown? am i crazy?,6,1.0,"Am I the only one who felt happier during lockdown? I usually hear the opposite.

* Peace and quiet without loud parties.
* Popular people finally felt what it’s like to be alone, forced to eat their own words of advice they've given me for decades ""you need to learn to be happy alone""- turns out they can't follow their own advice...
* Inconsiderate behavior was punished.
* Masks gave me equal treatment - without a mask I'm treated badly everywhere by strangers (apparently i must be ugly), when no one could see my face suddenly I was treated the same as everyone else- it made me realise how easy life is for everyone else.
* Safer streets reduced my anxiety.
* Time off work improved my mental health.
* No plane or traffic noise cured my headaches.
* Less crime and anti-social behavior made it safe to go outside.
* Grocery deliveries were done properly reducing my stress massively.
* No work stress or construction noise.

My happiness improved a thousand-fold.

My mental health improved massively. My headaches stopped completely, anxiety went away, everything became better.

When it takes a worldwide virus / lockdown to improve your life you know you must be really squashed by society... and yes I've tried moving area, it's just variations of the same problems.

Why do I want to hurt people? - Dark,4,1.0,"Was told by some in r/jung to post this here, I hope you can give me some help

Sorry if this is not the right way to post this question, but I’ve had it ever since I can remember. It’s of interest to me to understand why I have these feelings and thought this sub may find it interesting also to dissect. 

Background, I’m a pretty successful early twenties male, had a great family, great early life, friends, relationships, I’m in very good shape, very disciplined, generally very happy. No history of any abuse. Some slight mental health in teens but mainly around slight social anxiety, some slight anger but nothing out of the ordinary. Generally empathetic to people and animals. Very loyal, loving etc etc. I do not think I’m a psychopath or sociopath really at all. 

Yet, I fantasise about hurting and killing… As fucking crazy as that sounds. My earliest memory is being on a beach as a child with my mother, and watching other little kids and imagining drowning them, yes,,, that crazy. This has gone literally as long as I remember. The feelings are almost masturbatory and I generally find the idea of hurting someone extremely appealing. 

It feels like a separate personality to me, these urges, constantly calling on me to act on them or think about them. I will tell more below due to character limits.

IF you find this interesting, have any info or questions please reply, thank you.

What should I do in this situation?,4,1.0,"Hi! I’m a seventeen year old girl from Finland so I apologise in advance for my bad English. 
I have this weird feeling all the time. I have a feeling that I’m making my whole life up. Like I know all this is real, but I still have this weird irrational fear that I’ll someday just ”come back to reality”

The feeling just comes suddenly at random times. When I’m home, with my friends, riding my bike etc. The thought of it comes in my head and I feel like I can’t get rid of it.
I can describe the feeling a bit . I’m aware that I’m awake and alive, but I still fear that I’m making my whole life up. For example my friends, my boyfriend or my job. Like normal things I know are real but I still fear that they ”will suddenly just disappear”.  

I’ve had this feeling on and off for few years now. I’ve had couple anxiety attacks because of this feeling. Once I asked to hug my friend just so I know she’s really there.

(I also suffer from misophonia but I don’t think it  has anything to do with this.)

Could somebody maybe help me identify this or give me advise. Thank you in advance <3

Update

Hey guys, I just wanted to give you guys a update. First of all, thank you so much for everything, I was literally crying with how much support random people we're willing to help me. I apologize if I didn't responded to any of your comments, but Once again thank you so much.

So I did had a mental breakdown of sorts, it started when my boyfriend and I were talking and he suggested that we can move in together, despite knowing I want to live on my own for a bit.(he was trying to help, not pressure or guilt trip me at all. He also has a tendency to forget things when excited, will talk to him about it.) it resulted in me writing a letter to my folks since they weren't exactly listening. 

Then it resulted in the meltdown, but my parents and I talked and hugged it out, and dad even suggested he would pay for my solo trip. I declined because I wanted to do things my way(but will keep in mind for the future,lol). Plus he reminded me that I still have time and I can start with community college then get the bachelors, then finally get my masters if I want. I love my parents so much, and I love my boyfriend, I've just been so stressed about everything, trying to be perfect for both of them. Maybe sometime on my hobbies and doing a 'not being judgmental 'week challenge on my artwork is what I need.

This is to the degree where I have literally not gone to funerals or cursed them on their death bed because they wronged me in some menial way.

I held that grudge forever. I didn't talk to him again until he was on his death bed. He called me over the phone (or rather my family forced me to answer) and he was sad we never reconnected. I laughed at him for having cancer, dying, reality being meaningless, no one will miss him, etc. then hung up and that was that. Didn't go to his funeral and messed up his grave.

thinking of cutting myself again. please help.,50,0.91,"im a 20 y/o male, almost 21. for the past year i've been feeling stuck. *really really stuck*. i can´t seem to solve my problems like my pmo and binge eating addiction. i've surpassed my optimal weight and ive been gaining more pounds each day. all the women i've been with since last year tend to bore me and i start to kinda dislike them. i've had two girlfriends since then and i don't even know why i got on those relationships on the first place, i always start disliking these people. univeristy doesn´t even stress me because i´ve been ignoring all of my responsibilities. i´ve had two diaries, a sketchbook, a recorded journal and even a blog, all places on which i try to express my feelings, but i always abandon them, and even then,i can´t even seem to write something new in them, it's always ""i feel stuck and i dont know what to do"". recently i´ve been having trouble with my sexual life due to my pmo addiction, i can´t get aroused, and even if i manage to engage on sexual activity, i don´t feel pleasure, i feel nothing. and i´ve even become ashamed of my body, that hasn´t happened to me in a long time, i was with a girl the other day and i couldn´t even take my shirt off, i´ve become afraid of intimacy. ALL of this has made me a boring, hateful, arrogant, egotistical and unmotivated person. when i´m with people i can´t seem to lighten up and, when i hear their problems, i tend to get hateful and call them cowards or that their wrong for thinking the way they think. and i KNOW this is horrible, i know i´m not making any sense and that i'm insensitive, but i cant´help it. i used to be such a light hearted person, i used to be optimistic and try to push myself throughout all my fears and troubles in order to become better, and loved to be with people, and now i´m nothing.

and now i´ve been thinking really hard of cutting myself again. i used to do it when i was 14 and 17. bad habit. and i hadn´t done it since. but now i think about it at every hour. i can´t cry, crying doesn´t come out of me, and even if i feel like i WANT to cry, i unconsciously contain myself from it. so now i want to cut myself, like i used to. i don´t even know what i will gain from it, i dont know what i gained from it then, but i need to. i can´t feel anything, i feel like i need the pain, that it will release something, i don´t know. i need help, please.",mentalhealth,mekhanem,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dg50gp/thinking_of_cutting_myself_again_please_help/,27,54.94505494505494,4.945054945054942,0.00011713515339808844,"['im', 'male', 'almost', 'past', 'year', 'feeling', 'stuck', 'really', 'really', 'stuck', 'seem', 'solve', 'problem', 'like', 'pmo', 'binge', 'eating', 'addiction', 'surpassed', 'optimal', 'weight', 'ive', 'gaining', 'pound', 'day', 'woman', 'since', 'last', 'year', 'tend', 'bore', 'start', 'kinda', 'dislike', 'two', 'girlfriend', 'since', 'even', 'know', 'got', 'relationship', 'first', 'place', 'always', 'start', 'disliking', 'people', 'univeristy', 'even', 'stress', 'ignoring', 'responsibility', 'two', 'diary', 'sketchbook', 'recorded', 'journal', 'even', 'blog', 'place', 'try', 'express', 'feeling', 'always', 'abandon', 'even', 'even', 'seem', 'write', 'something', 'new', 'always', 'feel', 'stuck', 'dont', 'know', 'recently', 'trouble', 'sexual', 'life', 'due', 'pmo', 'addiction', 'get', 'aroused', 'even', 'manage', 'engage', 'sexual', 'activity', 'feel', 'pleasure', 'feel', 'nothing', 'even', 'become', 'ashamed', 'body', 'happened', 'long', 'time', 'girl', 'day', 'even', 'take', 'shirt', 'become', 'afraid', 'intimacy', 'made', 'boring', 'hateful', 'arrogant', 'egotistical', 'unmotivated', 'person', 'people', 'seem', 'lighten', 'hear', 'problem', 'tend', 'get', 'hateful', 'call', 'coward', 'wrong', 'thinking', 'way', 'think', 'know', 'horrible', 'know', 'making', 'sense', 'insensitive', 'used', 'light', 'hearted', 'person', 'used', 'optimistic', 'try', 'push', 'throughout', 'fear', 'trouble', 'order', 'become', 'better', 'loved', 'people', 'nothing', 'thinking', 'really', 'hard', 'cutting', 'used', 'bad', 'habit', 'done', 'since', 'think', 'every', 'hour', 'cry', 'cry', 'come', 'even', 'feel', 'like', 'want', 'cry', 'unconsciously', 'contain', 'want', 'cut', 'like', 'used', 'even', 'know', 'gain', 'dont', 'know', 'gained', 'need', 'feel', 'anything', 'feel', 'like', 'need', 'pain', 'release', 'something', 'know', 'need', 'help', 'please']","{'neg': 0.196, 'neu': 0.7, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': -0.9933}",negative

I had a weed-induced psychosis last night. Why did I go through that TERRIFYING experience?,0,0.5,"I have never tried any cannabis in my life. Rarely drink. No history of mental illness as I know it. But I had 1-3mg of a weed rope gummie last night in the presence of friends -- a tiny piece! -- and two hours in, after a weird kind of relaxing high and slight headache, I started to lose my mind.

I stumbled to the bathroom in a daze. Came back and absolutely nothing felt real. I felt like I was both asleep and awake, alive and dead, stuck in my body. I was extremely paranoid if this current moment was real and I was panicking if this feeling would ever stop.

I remember asking my friends incessant questions and them calming me down. Taking a cold shower. Throwing up, asking them to take me to the ER. Being in the hospital and sleeping it off.

I cannot explain to you the dread, panic, terror, and paranoia I felt. I never, ever want to experience that again, and just remembering the moment makes my stomach churn and take me back to that place.

WTF did that happen? The one thing I am so incredibly, deeply grateful for is that it happened with my friends, who I trust. The thing that grounded me over and over is that my friends are kind, they wouldn't fool me, I trust their judgement, this is reality. But it's like remembering that love was my last tether to reality.

A predator relative ruined the way I see things and I have no clue what to do.,9,1.0,"I posted this a while ago and it got absolutely 0 replies or advice. So I simply tried forgetting. Recently though, something reminded me of this, and I'm starting all the progress of forgetting over from the start again. Also, for context, I'm a dude, which may be important but may not be? I don't really know.

So i'm not really going to elaborate, but let's just say my cousin did some very bad shit to my sister. I never knew anything happened or was happening, and the whole time we were just totally fine. I never even knew. Until I knew. The man is a monster.  

Fast forward to after all this was revealed to me, a ton of stuff is totally tainted now and it's making me super sad. I used to love rebuilding computers, but ever since I found out about what he did and that he did that too, it just reminds me of him. I used to love playing multi-player games with him since he was good at only some of them and I was good at most of them so I'd usually beat him (I admit I did take advantage of that). 

A few days ago (a few MONTHS ago, this is old but applies) I was playing an online game and thought about the times i played it with him, and then thought about what he did, and then remembered that he made me sit on his lap while playing and that train of thoughts was so disturbing I literally froze while playing the game while online. It must have been 5 minutes or so of me just sitting there listening to Team Fortress noises blasting in the background having some sort of terrible mental event until I finally sort of ""snapped back"" and just shut the computer off and went to bed. I havent opened it since out of fear of being reminded of him. I feel bad for my teammates, because I'm sure I probably made them lose.  

Even my college planning is getting screwed up. My current choice of college is a community College, and since I'm kinda dumb and also kinda poor, it's the only option I have. Fine school, but it reminds me of him. I'm genuinely not sure how to handle possible taking classes in a school he went to. I even remember visiting him once. I'm considering crossing it off my list. (Even months later this is still true, but sadly it's like the only college I can get in in range of me that isn't either extremely suspicious, online, or a trade school.)

Hell, now that it's been a few months since I wrote some of this I notice that even my *laugh* sometimes reminds me of him. Now I want to reprogram my throat so I can stop thinking of that vile monster when I start laughing. Thank God me and the rest of my family have a restraining order on him, but he's *STILL* fucking with me.

"I destroyed my friendship with my best friend, relapsed, and then made everything in my life a thousand times worse.",13,1.0," ~~ I posted this in another subreddit, but figured I could maybe use some kind words or hope if you have any to spare. I’m out of them myself. I’ll finish the post in edits due to length. ~~

I’ve been an addict of some sort since I was 15 years old. It started with little white lies and leading a double life out of fear of coming out as trans, evolving into alcohol to cope as a young adult. By the time I finished college, I was taking and abusing pills and meth on a semi-regular basis, and I was a full-blown opioid addict by the time I was 26.

Eventually, I sobered up, started AA, and turned my life around, hitting a year of sobriety. Throughout all of it, one of my best friends, Kyle (name has been changed) stood by my side. For context, I had previously developed romantic feelings for Kyle and was shot down in the kindest of ways, and over time we got closer and closer and became as close of friends as friends could be. My feelings for him never faded, but I just kept them to myself, always respecting his boundaries and never wanting to ruin what we had.

A few weeks ago, I started struggling with my sobriety. I felt the joy of my day to day life starting to slip through my fingers, and the pressure of recovery was becoming too much to handle. But because my life was going “so great”, I started having to look for reasons to justify relapsing; at least, that’s my theory for why I did what happens next.

One night, I invited Kyle over to my house to watch a movie and hang out. The entire time we’re together, I only had two thoughts going through my head: that I was in love with him, and that I wanted to get high more than anything in the world. I’ll spare all of the boring details of us hanging out, but as he was leaving and I hugged him goodbye, I did the very thing I was determined never to do and I kissed him, crossing that boundary. He texted me the next day that he wasn’t mad at me but that he needed time to build trust back in our friendship.

Later on, instead of taking responsibility and his feelings into account for the fact that I crossed the line and broke his trust, I doubled down. I became needy and obsessive. I posted online about how heartbroken and in love I was. I wrote poetry about him and sent it to him. I hounded him with confessions of my feelings. I treated him like an object. Deep down, I knew that I either needed him to fix me or I needed him to hurt me enough to break me.

And then it happened. After a few days of silence, he texted me and told me how everything I did and was doing made him feel and that he didn’t want me to reply or speak to him. I did what I sought out to do and I lost my best friend. Everything inside of me shattered. And that night, I wiped and deleted all of my social media, turned off my phone’s texting, drove into the city, and relapsed in a parking lot in my car.

It all happened so fast it was like a blur. Every ounce of pain and regret and sorrow and fear I had been pushing down the last year instead of actually facing in recovery came surging back up as I vomited out the back door of my car. The three minutes I was high . . . I don’t even remember them. I completely blacked out and woke up after hours of nodding off, realizing what I’d done. I drove home, got some sleep, went to an AA meeting, and left again to try and find a treatment center, only to be turned away at every step.

So here I am, exactly 8 days since the night I kissed Kyle. I’ve been using every day since that first night I relapsed. It took me a week and a day to lose my best friend, my sobriety, my job, my family’s trust, and probably a ton of other things I can’t even think of right now. I’m too scared to turn my texting back on. I’m too scared to download social media again. Right now . . . I exist in a bubble, isolated in the confines of my car. I doubt anyone is looking for me, but if they are, I truly don’t think I want to be found like this. Part of me wants to recover so badly and claw my way out of this so I can fix things with him. Another part of me wants to go on to the end of this because I deserve it.

But either way, no matter what happens, I feel so much regret for putting him through all of what I did. I made him a pawn in a game he never signed up for and I used him as a means to justify my own self-destruction. I want to make amends with him but I don’t even know where I would start. I wish I could take it all back. I wish he had never had to meet someone like me.

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, so I guess I just needed to confess my sins out loud while I still can. If you’re reading this and you’re struggling with addiction and thinking about getting help, please do. Recovery is a beautiful thing, and one of my deepest hopes is that it works for others better than it did for me.

If you made it to the end, thank you for reading. I hope you don’t judge me too harshly, but I understand if you do. I don’t deserve sympathy. But if you have any to spare, I could really use some kind words. I have none left of my own.

Of course, the women that I have tended to connect with throughout my life have been pretty much all neurotic to some extent - trauma, psych meds, the whole deal. 

I care deeply for this girl I’ve gotten close with recently, but she has suffered with severe anxiety her whole life. She’s pretty heavily medicated and, of course, this really brings up my fear of bringing a child into the world that may end up with our combined super-anxiety or something.

Hereditary Lack of Empathy ,3,0.81,"Hey folks… kind of a thought / vent / question I guess… trying to think of where to even start 

Ever since I was a child, a long as I can remember I have had a complete and total lack of empathy, like zero empathy. I didn’t know what to call it at the time, but as I’ve gotten older that’s what I’ve realized it to be. 

Someone could tell me their dog died last night, and everyone around me would be emotional and “oh my god im so sorry” and in my head I would have zero emotion whatsoever, like it didn’t even matter at all 

This has obviously led to some challenges in life, specifically with my spouse and trying to see others point of views. 

It’s challenging because in arguments I would basically have zero idea “what the big deal is” meanwhile everyone else is saying they can’t believe I don’t understand why someone is upset/sad/etc etc 

For several years now I’ve been told by others I lack empathy, so I’ve tried to find ways to “manually” cope with this problem… for example if someone said their dog died, I would say oh man I’m so sorry…. Even though I personally feel nothing about it, I just know via societal norms it’s just the right thing to say… so I’m basically solving the problem via superficial “emotional intelligence” more so then having any real thought or opinion or feeling on the matter 

Well recently I took one of those Genetic / DNA Tests and low and behold I got an alert saying that quote “I may lack empathy” because of a genetic mutation that actually physically makes it hard for me to chemically / emotionally have a reaction to these matters - so basically the entire things been genetic this entire time 

The problem obviously, is I don’t know any way to “fix” this , other then just trying to keep “faking it” and making sure I use proper language in empathetic situations without actually understanding at a deep level how it feels or what the issue is. 

Has anyone else ever felt or been this way?

I don't think I'm getting better,7,1.0,"Hi, I'm turning 20 in November, yet I feel like there really isn't much to life. The idea of graduating with a degree, pursuing a career that I'm passionate about, building a family all seems so mundane to me.

I truly envy others who seemingly know what they're doing and wasting no time, thinking about useless stuff like what I'm doing to work towards their goals. I sound like a lazy person that's complaining about every minute thing right now, but the truth is I probably am. But I like to think that I've put an effort to not feel this way but yet I feel nothing.

I feel disconnected from everyone. Parents speak about trusting God and his plans. Good friends all have sound advice for me to deal with this feeling, however I've never been able to resonate with any of it. I'm truly lost. Perhaps I'm finding an excuse to working hard by feeling this way. Maybe not. Either way I'm feeling it.

I used to blame my parents for my upbringing. It may as well be their fault for me being like this. Eventually I've come to accept that holding it against them solves nothing, so I blame myself. I really see no possible future where I can love existing as  the person that I am. I have no idea who I am anymore. Everyday I have a hundred thoughts for every single thing I want to do. It's exhausting and I don't think I can do it anymore.

I'm scared of the pain of dying. But sometimes I wish I had the balls to do it. This whole life thing is not working out for me no matter what bullshit mindset I'm forcing myself to have. I'm gonna start praying I don't wake up the next day starting from tonight.

Imagination as a life raft,1,1.0,"This is super long, and is not super important.



I'm not sure if this is the right place for it so feel free to delete it if not. But after a conversation with a friend, I thought I'd share what keeps me alive in my darkest moments. 

A bit of background; I struggle with bipolar disorder, ADHD and PTSD. I have numerous years of intense trauma and I suffer with the symptoms of PTSD everyday as a result. I'm also currently going through a depressive episode that kind of took me by surprise so it's been heavy days for sure. But there have been many heavy and dark days, and for some reason I've decided to stick around even when I have struggled to articulate why. I think I'm finally able to. I hope this helps or is at least semi-interesting.

I got into the whole manifestation train a few years back, and although I don't believe in it now I did gain one valuable skill from it; imagination. I mean the kind of extremely detailed intentional imagination, not an abstract fantacy. I use it to imagine, in detail (sounds, smells, sensations on my skin, buildings, weather etc.) what my life would look like if I didn't suffer so acutely with bipolar and ptsd. Who would I be? What would I sound like? What would my interests be? What kind of friends would I have? What would my apartment look like? What would my curtains look like? I mean in extreme detail, I have to be able to recall it as if it was a place I'd actually been. Sometimes I'll write it down or take a voice note if my brain is struggling to hold on to details, but usually the image and the emotions it conjures up is enough. 

I'm not a mental health professional so I can't explain exactly how this, frankly made up, image creates a sense of longing, but it does. This longing will usually stay with me for a while. Sometimes it'll make me sad (because it's not my reality) and sometimes it will make me angry (that I even have to imagine such a seemingly mundane existence). And in those feelings I'm able to process the pain I'm currently experiencing. It allows the feelings to come to the surface, and I can cry, I can write, I can stare at a wall and contemplate, it's different every time. But after a few days, the image will be almost like a memory (I'll obviously know I imagined this some days ago, and somehow (again, I'm not an expert), the image will become a kind of memory making it feel like something different than an imagination. Not quite a real memory, not quite a figment of my imagination. The feelings I feel when I think about it is real. The effort I took to conjure up the image is real, so the image becomes its own kind of not-real but still real thing. This feeling of attachment to the image will usually be enough to spark even a mustard seed of hope.

Not enough to suddenly be cured of depression, and not even enough to stop my unhealthy coping skills. But enough to want to believe that it \*can\* be real. Often times that desire for it to be real, will be enough to take tiny steps. A shower, a dish wash up, a reply to a friend or even searching up mental health professionals on TikTok to know I'm not loosing it. 

This was super long, and I'm sorry if it was useless. Thank you for reading, and excuse my spelling mistakes. Just thought I'd share in case it could be interesting/useful to someone.

Where I am,1,1.0,"Sometimes I have to take a step back and just appreciate where I am mentally. 

In early 2020, I left my now ex wife because I was totally miserable. I didn't go about it in the best way but with the benefit of hindsight, had I communicated more, it would have just prolonged the inevitable and we wouldn't have worked out. 

I became homeless and was taken in by a couple of friends. I ended up living with them for six months until I moved back in with my mum & dad. That was late 2020. 

In early 2021, the loneliness hit me and I became suicidal. I was living in a seaside town. There was one evening that was particularly stormy so I walked out to the sea front and stood there, seriously considering walking into the water. I ultimately decided not to go through with it because of the shadow it would cast over my nieces and nephew. 

Anyway, cut to 4 years later and I've met a woman I adore, who I'm engaged to. I've moved to Scotland to be with her, leaving my old life behind. I quit my job and found another up here. I can honestly say I've never been happier. 

I still think back to how I felt in those darkest moments. How hopeless it all was. And I can barely reconcile that feeling with the happiness and fulfilment I feel now. My point is that no matter how bleak it may feel, there can be light at the end of the tunnel.

Embarrassing Depressive Tendencies,1,1.0,"In the past especially when I was a young depressed teenager I took to writing poetry as a way to try and work out my feelings in detail.
 Recently my depression and suicidal ideation have gotten particularly bad and I, from nowhere, just opened up notes on my phone and all this shit just came pouring out of me. I’ve only typed in it twice and those times were a month apart and those are to two paragraphs. Below is the poetry I don’t know what to do with it but I think I’d like it to be out there in the universe after I’m gone 

I will die on this room
And I’m trying everything from doctors to shrooms from work to rest but somehow I’m  just as depressed and my body is failing and my minds been gone for so long I only recall how to sing songs. And now I’m forgetting faces, I’m forgetting times spent, times had, voices and the fun we’ve had in these places. I’m living in Deja vu, everything is “I’ve heard that, I’ve felt this” and now I’m afraid I’ll forget you. 
I will die in this room, an embarresment a disgrace it’s all gone wrong and im just somebody not built for this place and there are tears on this face that I don’t recognise anymore, where’s the smile wheres the eyes where’s the voice my mother adores?
I will die in this room and I’m so glad the walls are painted, the sky has turned grey I’m infectiously tainted and it’s cold, it’s so damn cold as I watch myself grow old. 
I will die in the room and I can’t sleep sober intoxicated inebriated whatever feels like “this aint over” but there’s so much hate, calm down too late I’ve missed my chance. Watch it walk, don’t talk and speak when your spoken to. Don’t think don’t feel just do and don’t give up, give in. Be consumed by the life you think you’re in. 
I’m confused, I’m confused by misery by anger by love by fury am I motivated? eyes dilated? I feel ready for war and I have to be this be. 
This war never ends and I will die in this room 

I will die in this room and it’s getting a little closer, time to say goodbye raise a glass and toast her. Here’s to the ending of tide, still, peaceful water and whatever’s left inside so let me rest. It’s been a while, without the nightmares, this fear and sense I don’t belong here. Come see this life and steal it, I’m not sure if it’s just in my head anymore and I Swear I can feel it. On the tips of my fingers in shake across my brow or silence in my ears telling me to die now. Baby let me die, how can I go on like this. Too afraid to live and afraid to be free, afraid that I might take a couple people with me. God, just let me go first. I swear it’s for the best and it’s cold in the chest already. 
I will die in this room and I’m sorry I feel this way, but you’re all the reason I’m here day to day, maybe I’ll be gone today or maybe another day. Pushing pushing it back just a little further so I can see their smiles for just a little longer and I hope that I will remember. What it’s like to know you are loved, or to feel love, or give love or even just to believe in it anymore. I’m surrounded and left out.

"I don't know what is wrong with me, any ideas?",2,1.0,"So, I grew up in a family were therapy and medication was seen as a scam. My mother doesn't believe in therapy and her opinion is that medication doesn't do anything except make you addicted to drugs. So I have never been to therapy and it honestly scares the shit out of me, because im afraid that they will prescribe me medication and that I will become dependent on them, but lately I have been thinking of contacting my GP to see if I can get a referral to a therapist to see if I can get tested for ADHD, but In reality I just want to know what the fuck is wrong with me, but I also don't want to sound like a spoiled brat. I know I probably shouldn't ask for a diagnosis from reddit, in fact that isn't what I'm asking, I just want to know if the things I mention are normal, or if I should mention them to the therapist. So here goes:

- I keep forgetting things, whole swabs of my life I constantly forget existed. 

- I keep forgetting smaller details, where I left my keys, or my wallet, or names of important thing after they just have been mentioned

- I lose motivation incredibly fast

- I have an intense fear of swallowing pills

- I have headaches almost every day

- I can't focus for long periods of time

- I skip out on meals because eating on my own makes me feel uncomfortable

- if a single bad thing happens to me I quickly shut down and self isolate

- I get the feeling everyone hates me, or that I am a bother to other people, and that if I reach out for any form of attention I am being a burden to people

- in the corner of my eye it always feels like someone is looking at me

- I see shadows move, Even if they are stationary.

- I am afraid that I will look like an attention whore for asking for help, and I often avoid asking for help as a whole.

- I feel like my emotions are fake

- I get uncomfortable really fast, in tight spaces, when I'm wet, when someone is close. I just get this feeling in my stomach and throat like a big knot.

- I get that feeling of a knot in my stomach and throat a lot actually.

- I'm always afraid someone is looking at me 

- I can't speak to strangers, I will freeze up and get that knot feeling again

- I can't look people in the eyes 

- public speaking is impossible 

- I aways feel like everyone is laughing at me

- I am not suicidal, but I have taught of hurting myself.

- I often feel like I am fucking up at every point in my life

- I am afraid that I am doing even this for attention.

Is there more to it?? ,1,1.0,"Hi!! 20F here, diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and it is extremely likely that I also have OCD (many mentions of it in medical records, doctor and psychiatrist have stated that they think I probably have it, but they are uncomfortable with diagnosing me formally due to my age :// (yay UK healthcare). However, I’m worried there’s something else going on with me, but my doctor isn’t really listening to me and tends to dismiss me. 

I’m ridiculously mood swingy and to very Extreme levels. Most of the time I tend to just feel neutral, fine, but throughout my days I’ll have ridiculously low lows (e.g. feeling legitimately suicidal over something incredibly minor, or explosive anger that completely shuts me down. However, an hour or so later I can feel completely fine and happy again). I unfortunately am also quite hot and cold with people - my friends I would absolutely die for, but typically when getting to know people, it’s so easy for me to become irritated by something minor and start to resent them, or, if I feel like a person is losing interest in me, I’ll be sure to ice them out first before they can do it to me. 

I also go through periods of time where my libido shoots through the roof and I become ridiculously hypersexual, and this manifests in problematic ways for me. (More risky behaviour, shamefully I’ll flirt and be sexual towards people I am not attracted to because I love the attention and validation. (E.g., I am a lesbian, but during these periods of time I will be sexual towards men, even though I don’t really enjoy it, because it is much easier to get that validation and approval). When I stop feeling hypersexual I am very ashamed and feel embarrassed and guilty over my behaviour, but the cycle repeats.

My emotions just feel very intense and difficult to handle, but my doctor keeps insisting that everything is normal. I can’t help but worry that there’s more going on here.

feel like I can't interact with people anymore I know a couple of girls but I just feel like they arent my type but also i cant feel like anyone is my type (really don't mean to speak lowly of them but imma explain in a bit) they don't seem interested in anything I like and I tend to speak enthusiasticly about things I like but then their vibes is such a turn off so I just ditch them and no longer speak to them again but then they just come saying that I don't care about them and blame me for other things but I really can't do efforts once I'm turned off from something (I really hope somebody tells me if what I am doing is right but I really feel so bad when I don't get matching vibes about what I like it turns me off so much but also idk if it's something wrong with me because nobody ever really cared about what I love) that like one part of the problem the other part is that I hate how women deal so much they just want all the attention and give nothing in return but again that could be me because I can't feel anything, one girl says she loves me so much but I still don't feel anything it just makes me extra dull and sad.... now this part is far from the girls part it's more about me I hate life so much I find that people do such very stupid things I can't tolerate I really hate being around people I hate hearing about them I see their is alot of bad things in the world people die and get killed people fight with each other for no reason I can't really tolerate this world neither do I wanna see it get anybetter Idk why but sometimes I wish I could watch the

My sister wanted to go to the hospital, but changed her mind when she remembered we have a concert for her favorite artist the next weekend. I don’t want to deny her feelings, but I’m not sure if she was actually suicidal since she completely changed her mindset to go to this concert.

She just said she wanted to kill herself again after being denied a sleepover. Has anyone had experience with this?

I desperately need counseling. I was seeing a counselor but she costed $300+ per session and when I told her I couldn’t afford it she told me I shouldn’t be looking for a therapist if I couldn’t afford it, that therapy was a “luxury not a necessity”.
But I’m pretty sure it’s a necessity for me. She had put me on Zoloft, which made me feel like shit, so she upped the dose saying it would make it work better and it made everything so much worse. Then I had to stop seeing her so that I could afford to. The Zoloft made me feel so horrible and everytime I took it I was throwing up less than an hour later so I just stopped taking it.

I just. Can’t. Do. It. I know I’m being childish and stupid and let things get to me too easily. Obviously, almost no one likes their job. But, I don’t know how they then have the ability to know they have to get up, day after day, and go do something they can’t look forward to.

How do I help myself ,1,1.0,"Today at a “team” meeting, I was pointed out by finger by my manager for a issue that could of been fixed if he took me to the side but nah he was getting angrier and angrier while staring right me like all our problems in warehouse is because OF ME in front of the guys. 

First off being pointed out by hand and angrily talking about it and staring right at me I n front of my co workers was mind blowing especially for the new employees. (Afterwards my co workers said it was fucked up and insane how I kept my cool)

The spot light was right on me. Making it seem like I don’t do a lick of work and all I do is lean on the desk and scroll tik tok for 9+ hours a day. 

Even though I help out every day in each area of our warehouse and my scanner movement is high (productivity) and dealing with customers with orders, which is my what my positions main goal is. 

Anyways, the way I was humiliated really got to me man. Typing this, my boils my blood. 

Feels like I was the punching bag.

If it wasn’t for my family I probably would have gone ballistic by talking mad shit and walked out but I kept saying to myself it’s only a fucking job so keep your cool. 

I honestly feel like I’m going to snap when I relive it cause I have other issues going on in my personal life. I want to resolve this and move on.

People on the internet need to understand this one thing,4,0.83,"You can hop on reddit, get on a burner account, and wreak absolute havoc with zero repercussions. 

You can respond to someone’s post about how they want to off themself and decide to tell them they’re a horrible human being for putting other people through that. 

You can judge someone for using Reddit or the internet as a source of help. 

You can make the conscious decision to bully someone who is at rock bottom. 

It’s so incredibly easy being mean to people you don’t know. You’ll never learn their name, you’ll never see them in person. You’ll never feel the guilt or see their face when they read your disgusting message. 

Like I said, there’s zero repercussions. 

I’ll still never be able to understand why people do it. Why trolls are a thing. Why people find gratification in doing these things. 

We learn to ignore the “internet trolls,” or we hear “don’t let them get to you,” as a response. But we continue to allow it to happen. It’s almost expected of you to just brush off rude comments and you’re weak if you let them get to you. Why is that? How come they don’t put algorithms in play to stop trolling from happening? Bullying on the internet has caused a lot of issues. 

It’s one of the most disgusting things on the planet in my opinion. 

Personally, I’ve reached out for help. Several times. Been at rock bottom, several times. Wanted to off myself, several. times. And every time, I’d get rude comments that just made me want to do it even more. 

One rude comment almost trumps 5 nice ones. And they know that. 

I understand the whole “hurt people hurt people” scenario but damn. I’ll admit it, it gets to me. I get that I’m putting a target on my back by admitting that but nothing will change if I don’t post this. Either way, I’m going to receive hate.

"Without adderall, it feels like my brain won't turn on and function (prescribed for TRD, fatigue, sleep apnea)",1,1.0,"Long story short... I have battled major depression/anxiety for over half of my life. I am 32 now. These last 4 years have been the most difficult years of my life. COVID hit (living in LA, CA so it was the worst), and then immediately I lost my Dad tragically and unexpectedly. He was everything to me. Then I lost my Aunt (basically 2nd mother) a few months later. My world was turned upside down. I tried to continue working a stressful job at an AI startup that I helped co-found but had to resign. Then I had a horrible snowboard accident, 2 damaged discs, a herniated/pinched nerve, and a severe blow to the sacrum/pelvis. Doctors during covid wouldn't do imaging so I didn't find this out until a year or more later. Then I reinjured my penis. My meatus (penis hole) has been slowly tearing over the years. It ripped significantly more. Went to doctor after doctor. No one said there was a fix to repair my penis.

I fell further and further into a deep, dark depression, mainly brought on by grieving but the chronic intense pain and no relief or answers made my spiral. In the past, psych meds had never worked well. For a bit then stopped or made things worse. I did intensive therapy, ECT treatment, TMS, and Ketamine, and even tried other meds out of desperation. Then I was prescribed Adderall off-label for TRD. It worked. It helped with the pain, put away suicidal thoughts, I could function, get back into treatment, and make music, wow! I'm not new to stimulants, meaning I've witnessed my brother with ADD go down that path of trying different ones. I didn't think I had ADD, maybe idk, but severe depression makes you feel like you do have it. Now, as some may know. Adderall wears off. There is a crash. Since I was depressed, the crash was unpleasant. More intense SI, anger, irritability. I've been on and off it for the past 2 years. I've gone lower and lower with some ups and feeling hopeful.

I notice now that when I wake up, it's almost like my brain is just off. I'm so slow. Hard to do basic things. It's hard to process, communicate, remember, and do the things that I need to continue doing to get healthy. Like treatment, exercise, preparing for upcoming urological surgery, being in the community, also preparing to go back to work, etc. basic life. I know I am rambling but it is such a love/hate relationship with this drug. I've tried and tried without it even for long periods do everything that would or can heal my mind, promote neurogenesis, and help me feel ""normal"" like it even works. I have Adderall xr 10mg and boom, I can function.

Is anyone else experiencing this or has it in the past? I'm trying to find natural remedies that mimic what the stimulants are doing to my brain. I'm also tapering off of Cymbalta slowly, I take gabapentin 3x a day, I have Xanax XR, and Xanax IR as needed, and tapering down on Seroquel for sleep. My goal is to slowly get off all meds but I feel like I need something else to add a buffer to negate the side effects/balance out my confused brain with all of the neurotransmitters. I'm not addicted to Adderall, will use it when I HAVE to be on, or I know will help in situations so I can function and not be a catatonic zombie.

How do you ignore all the pain and suffering?,1,1.0,"There is pain and suffering all over, all the time, and I have always been able to see it. But my experiences with others have indicated to me that a huge amount of people either don’t see/feel all of the pain and suffering around them, or they manage to ignore it for the sake of functioning. How do you do it? 

I will graduate law school and enter the workforce in less than a year. In order to work enough, I will have to push the pain and suffering aside so much that I reject the values and personal traits I hold dearest to me. But if I don’t work to contribute to a society that I genuinely do not believe deserves to exist, then my partner will have to bear the burden of earning a livelihood just to try to experience the unique wonders of life.

I can’t stop seeing and feeling the pain and suffering of others, I have never been able to do that. And I can’t fix the problems myself as an individual. I keep setting up goals of things to do or try before I entertain suicidal thoughts any further, but the list keeps getting shorter and I am afraid that soon the only thing left will be to not burden my loved ones. And I don’t know how I will tolerate that burden on top of the world’s pain and suffering that I am unable to ignore. 

I need to figure out how to ignore it enough to live, before my list can run out.

Dark phase is over but mentally exhausted - part 3,1,1.0,"My biological mother still alive bt my biological father passed away.I for so long, grew up with anger and resentment on my biological father due to his lifestyle and comments given by adopted family and extended family and even during my wedding, we had an arguement and none from my biological family attended my wedding.But few weeks before passing away, my biological father asked about me and my wife with my biological mother, but since im wasn't talking much with my biological mother, i couldn't get this information. I attended his funeral and did the last rights. Ever since,i been visiting and talking to my biological mother but not frequently. I have a younger sister and younger brother from my biological parents, but we are not in good terms.The relationship soured when during their younger days, i found out that instead studying, my sister was going out with a guyi scolded her for this and promised to get her married and told her not to take any wrong decisions and instead to concentrate on her studies. she got pregnant and eloped with the guy, and came back and the guy ditched her and married another lady. She delivered the baby and my biological parents raised her kid. Now she is remarried. My younger brother dropped off school and the relationship with me soured when i scolded him for his drinking behaviours and for dropping off school. and now he is working for meager wages and heard that he is financially struggling. 
My biological mother asked me to support her financially as my brother and sister are struggling financially and later i found out that they are pressuring my mother to get money from me in pretense of expenses for my mother. I give her some cash whenever i visit as i felt too tired with all that going on.

In all this turbulence, one person who stayed true and strong with me, took me up when im down and broken was my wife.
They say that god doesn't give you what you like but what you need the most in your life. He gave her to me and i treasure her. I at times feel bad for being very emotional and treating her badly in the past during the dark phases of our life. She worked part time to support me when im was jobless for a year, ate one time so i could buy clothes for new job. At times, thinking back what she have done for me, my eyes get wet. I dont know what i did in my life to deserve her because all those around me and my wife, they were all fake peoples. Her parents stopped talking to her when she started financing her studies independently and didn't even attended our wedding.Its been 7 years they left her like that. 
But its always amazing how she always talks about how amazing i am, how i supported her during her hard and dark phase.
Im sharing these here as i wanted to get these off from my heart. I will be joining a new job, and mentally exhausted, felt worried if i could succeed in the new job, and we both planned to try for a baby, and worried how im going to raise the kid with my emotional damages.

Dark phase,1,1.0,"Im M, 35 yo. Married for 7 years. 

My life started to spiral out 10 years ago when my wife (then my gf) wasn't supported by her parents for her studies. I stepped in and helped her financially by working part time. She also worked part time and due to the high education fee in my country, our educational loan wasnst sufficient enough hence we borrowed from banks. we both graduated and tried to pay off the debts. In between, both of us was jobless for a year due to company down sizing and couldn't service the loans properly, and was almost had my car repossed. Changed few jobs for higher pays, sustained toxic bosses and now still paying off the debts, but good thing is we have managed to pay off large chunks of debts owed to banks and family members. Now leaving the toxic company and boss for a better paying job with what seem to be a better working environment (hopefully).We got married 7 years ago and postponed having baby as we weren't sure about raising a kid with high debts.
During this period, financial constraints and family members toxic emotions took a toll on us. both of us suffered mental pain and had frequent fights.

Help with a Son,1,1.0,"Trying to make a long story short…

Son, 24, mental break about 4 weeks ago. Involuntary commitment for past 10 days. Coming home tomorrow. Refuses professional help. So I’m all he got. Help. How do I set him set himself right? Get him thinking clearly? Give him something to live for?

I have many ideas about the root issues.

But I think I need to get him to see one OR figure out how to live with all the issues.

He’s angry. He’s parinoid. He doesn’t know what his purpose is. He desperately wants to be something. 

But I think he wants to figure it out but he don’t know how, or wont try.

My question: are there activities that I can give him to figure it out on his own?

Gonna start with asking him to plan his next day in 2hr blocks. Up at 8, bed by 10, sleep by 12.

Giving him small things to do, like cook 2 meals a day. Walk the dogs for an hour, plant a garden.

I think making him journal is key. But he fears some reading it. Gonna make him write a page and burn it the next night. *shrug* Don’t know if that’ll work.

We could make this about me but I’d rather not…but we can…just be polite.

More details that you could skip:



6 out of 10 on the ADHD scale.

Gamer since 6yrs old. Was his escape place.

High internet consumption from 10 to 19. More hours on the net than sleep. All the things you see about online kids. He did it.

Highly intelligent.

Father had no clue.

Involuntary admission for Psyc issues. (Ummm, the health care system sucks…but they did the best they could, but yeah, I would only advise that route out of desperation)

I messed up. ,2,1.0,"So, quick rundown first. The last month has been extremely rough on me.(21 M)

I lost my job, got dumped, and blew the transmission in my faithful old truck, all in the same day. I couldn't get any help with my truck, couldn't afford a shop, so I called my deadbeat father that I have spoken to 4 times in the last 15 years. He showed up, helped me drop my transmission, found out it would cost too much to rebuild, and he just up and left. Haven't heard from him since.

Now to the me part. Last Thursday, I did a bit of binge drinking, thinking it would help me out with my depression. Needless to say, it did not. I ended up sobbing in my truck with a [redacted] to my head. My best friend in the whole world managed to make me see sense, and brought me back. I've really come to depend on her. We talk all day every day. She is the best person I know. 

Then, on Saturday evening, I got a major nosebleed that lasted 3 hours straight and ended with me in the ER because I lost 2 pints of blood. Obviously that made me extremely woozy. The blood loss, coupled with the anxiety and depression, and a bit more alcohol because I didn't learn my lesson, lead me to a full mental breakdown Monday evening. And of course, I panicked and directed all my pent up emotions at my best friend. She hadn't been responding at all that day, and my abandonment issues due to aforementioned father lead me in a downward spiral of overthinking where I thought I was losing her too. So I lashed out. And it was bad. 

I haven't heard from her since. And that really hurts. Because the two of us have similar mental issues, and we've become kinda codependent. So losing her has just torn a part of me out. I hope I can recover. I hope I didn't drive a wedge between us permanently.

And of course, I have made my first appointment with a therapist.

Why is work so stressful?,1,1.0,"I am fine up until I sit at my cubicle. It feels like there is a heaviness surrounding it. I’m not getting sales but people do talk to me. Idk if I need to call a priest to bless my seat but every time I take lunch or leave for the day, I cry out my frustrations. There is a mix of other things that make me cry outside of work. 

I’ll feel better after crying but the minute I sit down, I get brain fog and fatigue. I don’t know if the seat has a bad vibe because of the last girl who sat there (she had anger issues). I just feel dead. I’m gonna move seats tomorrow to see if that changes things. 

I’m also starting trauma therapy EMDR so I feel so sad thinking of a lot of my issues. 

I get flustered at jobs that I can’t grasp right away. It could be food service or sales, if I’m not doing great at my job it really takes a damper on me. 

But what do I do to cope with my stressful job until I get a new position or turn my sales around?

There’s actually nothing specific I go to therapy for. I’m a recovering alcoholic with 2 years sober, moved to a new city, just balancing my life out. I have never asked someone why they are in therapy.

Test day panic attack,2,1.0,"Hi all, I’m (42M) ADHD and have started an extensive professional certification in wine this year (WSET4). I never finished college because of undiagnosed ADHD and lack of motivation. I’m now 14 years into a successful career in the wine industry and have decided to push myself by going for this certification. I’ve never know how to study and have only recently started figuring out what works for me. 

Today was my 2nd of 5 exams for this certification and I absolutely fucking melted down this morning before the exam. For the last 10ish days, I’ve found that studying has been even more difficult for me. I read a passage in the book and review flash cards but no matter how many times I review I could not get a lot of things to stick. My brain just seemed to be blocking me from inputting new information. I’d reread the passage again, then close my eyes and ask myself the question. Every single time, I could remember 3/4 things and I could visualize the text but the part I couldn’t remember was just blank in my mind. After rereading the same passage 3 times this morning and realizing it wasn’t sticking with 2.5 hours to go before the exam, I just went into a full on panic attack. Thankfully my wife was home and she just remained calm and listened to me cry and talk and after a 30 minute walk I calmed down enough to go take my exam. There is nothing really on the line here other than time and money to retake the exam and I told myself that repeatedly but it’s like my brain just wants me to succeed so badly that I can’t handle the thought of not passing. 

Test went ok and I feel much better on the other side although my anxiety is still very heightened.

weight gain on antidepressants that finally work,2,1.0,"i’ve tried many antidepressants for the past 8 years. none really helped, it was just one side effect after another. i got stuck with venlafaxin for years due to not having access to healthcare.

now that i finally got to switch to paroxetin last fall, i’m finally seeing a change! it’s not huge, but it’s been the first medicine to actually make me less depressed. the past ones at most helped reduce si and self harm. i now am able to feel happy and neutral some days. it hasn’t touched my ocd or anxiety whatsoever, but at least it’s something. 

the problem: i’ve started gaining a lot of weight. i was always slightly overweight but that’s because i hate exercise and have eating disorder issues like binging. however in the last half year my weight is just adding up, despite no other life change. i’m only 24 so i doubt it’s an effect of aging. i only now realized it’s likely paroxetin causing this. i’ve gained over 20kg in a short time, and it doesn’t seem to be stopping.

Jet lag from hell and anxiety doesn't help. Please help.,1,1.0,"I flew 22 hours from Chicago to Chiang mai Thailand and got maybe 3-4 hours of sleep before the flight. I haven't been on a long haul before and my anxiety was through the roof before the flight and during the flight so I couldn't sleep one bit. Finally getting to Chiang mai at 10ish pm and checking into the hotel I took a melatonin/chamomile supplement I got from 7/11 and slept for maybe an hour and woke up heart racing and mind racing. Couldn't sleep at all after that but got out of bed at 9ish to eat breakfast and walk around town. 

I think I messed up trying to take a nap around 4ish and got maybe an hour of extra sleep. Walked around some more and tried going to bed around 11pm but was up all night once again. At this point I was exhausted but mind racing and I started somewhat hallucinating and felt like I was in speed or something. 

Went to the clinic at 6ish am and they said I had severe anxiety and it led to insomnia and gave me 5 mg diazepam to take every night before bed and laxatives because the anxiety led to no bowel movements for almost 3 days.

I took the diazepam at around 930 because ei couldn't stand being awake any longer and slept until about 2ish and then hit the town again until 10 when I got back showered and took another pill only to sleep until 3 am and my heart is racing again and cannot fall asleep.

My parents already have an 11 year age gap and my mom was 19 when she married,am i a product of rape??

 I feel disgusting thinking of this and so guilty i havent been able to even look at my self for a month now and i avoid wearing my glasses or contacts i cant describe how it feels.i feel so disgusted with myself because i think it means i wasnt even born normaly and lovingly i was born from him being violent.I used to just tell myself that maybe he meant she wasnt allowed to abort but my mom is quite religous and doesnt belive jn abortions in the first place. My mom used to tell us she was in college for political science and i love hearing her stories of her before us but now it makes me feel disgusting because the only reason she gsve it all up was because i was born and i literally took everything from her. And i feel extra guilty because i still miss my dad and i love him even though i find him disgusting and i dont like it when he touches me, im old enough to not visit but i still do voluntarily.

What did he mean by that? Am i wrong to still love him?

"I don't know what's wrong with me, everyday is torture",1,1.0,"So I've been suffering mentally for a good while now but recently things have been getting much worse and I believe I need medical help. I have these horrible intrusive thoughts constantly. Literally every second of every day I'm trying to get rid of these intrusive thoughts by thinking positively but it only works like half of the time. These bastards that I hate won't get out of my head. I am sometimes in physical pain from punching and slapping myself because of these thoughts. I can't do anything. When I'm trying to do something I have to be thinking of positive people/words and if something negative comes into my head, I have to stop or start over. The word DEAD keeps coming into my head and other related words that involve injury or illness. I regret everything I do. Genuinely. Everything. I'm also incredibly indecisive, because I am so desperate not to end up regretting what I do. Which is normally what ends up happening. I keep thinking inanimate objects have feelings aswell. All these problems and these regrets I have in my life have been making me feel absolutely dreadful. I'm purposely isolating myself everyday and all I want to do is sit around playing video games all day on my own because I'm literally unable to do anything else. I've been feeling like ending my life lately.  I went to a doctor recently and the doctor said I have OCD. I feel like the things I said about the intrusive thoughts is what brought the idea of ocd up, but I'm not sure if the ocd is also responsible for the regrets, indecisiveness and worry. I think the plan was to take a prozac (fluxeotine) tablet so I'm not sure how much that helps or not. Maybe some people here have an idea of it. I'd appreciate any help or advice. Thanks.

How to help during breakdowns ,2,1.0,"I’m currently living with someone, a friend I’ve known for years, who is severely depressed and constantly crying and is just inconsolable almost everyday. I stand there and listen as they rail against life and the modern world and say they don’t want to live in this society, that their life is horrible, that there is nothing good about their life and they live in a dump and can’t stand it anymore.

I’ve tried everything, I tried saying what I’d think your “supposed to”, the platitudes. I’ve tried being honest. I’ve tried being there for them in every way I can think of. 
I’ve read countless articles on how to help someone suffering from depression, what to say what not to say, etc. None of it did any good. 

I’ve treated these episodes as emergencies (it really feels like life or death sometimes). I’ve treated these episodes as something normal, that happen to a lot to a lot of people,  focusing on remaining calm and trying to calm this person down.

I feel like everything I do and say just goes into a black hole. I feel like I’m watching these breakdowns happen from another dimension sometimes.

I really don’t know what to do. It’s to the point I’m afraid of this person. Every sound they make in the next room I literally jump. In the middle of the night, if they are walking down the hallway, I’ll wake up from a dead sleep.

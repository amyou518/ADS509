My daughter is scaring me tonight. No idea how to help.,930,0.98,2023-12-09 02:50:29,"My daughter (10) very suddenly this evening said she feels like she's in a dream/ like she's not real/ like she's a ghost. Said she feels like she's going to die. She doesn't look great, almost like she's sick, but she says she isn't sick except for feeling like she's going to die. Her pulse is normal.

I had her take a shower, brushed her hair and she put on her jammies. Tucked her bed with beach sounds and told her to relax and picture being at the beach. Walked in a couple of minutes later and she's crying.

I'm really worried but completely clueless. My husband thinks it's her ADHD/Adderall, but this has never happened before. She has been very moody and temperamental lately.

My mother having sex with me in the same room damaged my relationship with sex,608,0.97,2023-10-09 21:59:43,"When I was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend. Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.

I think I have PTSD from my wife giving birth.,454,0.95,2024-01-08 17:37:47,"Let me start with I know that what a woman goes through in labor is incredibly hard and challenging on them both mentally and physically. 

So my wife got induced Friday morning and things progressed fine all day. They gave her an epidural at 4PM Friday and things were good. Around midnight the baby’s heart rate dropped which caused my wife’s to drop.. 

We had every nurse on the floor in our room in seconds. They flipped her on hands and knees, woke the on-site surgeon and started prepping the OR and a crash team. They got her and the baby stabilized in about 15 min. So that was at midnight. 

She labored through until it caused too much stress on her body so they sedated her and put her on oxygen for a few hours around 4 AM Saturday. She progressed to a little over 9cm. 

Around 9:30AM Saturday she gradually stopped having contractions and essentially going backwards.

 They ended having to doing an emergency c section at 11ish. 

When the baby came out he wasn’t breathing and didn’t for the first 5 min. They had to resuscitate him all the while they had a hard time stopping my wife’s bleeding. So. Much. Blood…. It was all over.. The drs discovered some infection while they had her opened up and had to look for more infection which took them longer. I watched them pull my wife’s insides out asking for help with the bleeding and the NICU nurses flip my child’s lifeless body around to get him breathing. 

So I bounced around the operating room  between my wife and child checking on them for like 20 minutes being completely helpless. 

Both baby and mama have gotten the all clear and are at home recovering. No immediate issues with either of them.  I know it’s silly to be upset because we came home and are doing okay when so many people don’t get that opportunity. I just can’t get the OR out of my head. It’s playing over and over.

I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],444,0.96,2023-08-18 20:25:32,"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected. 

*The point for this post is that I DO NOT want to go mentally insane from everything that happened. I do not want to wake up one day in the mental hospital. My mental state is very shaky right now. Please help me , I don't know how but please help me. I don't want to lose my health*

it was all consensual in the moment, like i never told him no, but thinking back on it i feel like he took advantage of the mental state i was in, and his position of power to get what he wanted. it feels like when a police officer gets with someone they arrested.

"How do I explain my burnout to ""youre just lazy"" people?",399,0.95,2023-08-24 15:55:13,"Not only burnout, I also have depression. I'm 23.

I don't have a job. I could theoretically work a job, but I would not perform well at the job at all and possibly get fired for being unproductive, it would also do more harm than good to me. But the main reason I don't have a job is because a job would drain my time and energy, which I desperately need to work on my physical and mental health and also my to-do list at home, I just cannot handle any more responsibilities currently. Its too much, im already fighting a battle 24/7 and I do not wanna attempt to work even harder than what is physically possible.

So now I often get judged ""you are 23 why dont you have a job??"" or ""you should be studying""

""you should"" ""why dont you"" but when I reply that I don't have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do, they reply that I'm just lazzy and privileged.

I guess that someone who has always been mentally healthy cannot understand what it feels like to be unmotivated, to be physically tired or mentally, to have a brain that does not function well, to wake up tired even after 9 hours of sleep.

Feeling weird about some stuff my mom did to me and I just want answers.,344,0.99,2023-11-03 17:31:13," So, recently I was thinking about some things my mom has done while I was younger, I’m 17F now.

 I felt weird about it but didn’t say anything. I would also lay down in the bed with her and she would start touching my inner thighs but nothing further. Also, she would make me and my brothers rub her feet but she would make weird moaning noises and said that she had a foot fetish. She also made a weird joke about how she would show me what it’s like to get molested and tried taking my clothes off jokingly?? I remember being very uncomfortable.

When I was around 14, I told her that I had a boyfriend and she slammed me on the ground and made me tell her information about him and would not let me go. 

 Also, (last month) I was dealing with issues with constipation and she bought me this laxative device that you have to stick in your butt to do. I have trauma from that era specifically because I was raped in July and she knows that, she even knows that specific area is just a source of trauma.

His therapist told him to take a trip alone for a week and that is what he is going to do. I don’t know Is anyone going thru this or knows what this is? If so can people get better?

**UPDATE**
So we are divorcing. He told me he wants to sleep with other women on his vacation so I’m done with him.  I’m going to keep this post up since it gives people a chance to share there stories.

What are y’all’s telltale signs that you’re in a depressive episode?,328,0.99,2024-03-08 22:21:12,"Sometimes the signs can be subtle, but I feel like a lot of people have one big thing that clues them into the fact they are definitely in a depressive episode. 

For me, I think it’s probably not caring enough to even have 2 full meals in a day, and keeping the light off for almost the entire day without opening my blinds. 

I feel like sharing these can also help other depressed people maybe realize what their signs are and help them deal with it as best they can once they recognize the signs.

My parents were having sex next to me and it fucked me up,316,0.94,2023-09-08 07:50:07,"Hi guys. Just wanted to vent a bit about some of my childhood traumatic experieces.
When I was a child my parents had been having sex next to me in the same bed. My first memories are from around when I was 5 years old. They were doing it thinking I was asleep but I was too scared to tell them I am not and that I see and understand everything. I started then to make some noises during their sex so they could feel uncomfortable and they stopped doing it since I was about 7 because they moved me into my own room.
The thing is that it made me sexual way too young. I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...
I feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.

Update: Thank you all for such a support. I feel much better after reading your comments about the fact I was just a child and is not my fault I wasn't taught about sex and what's right and what's not. I also want to mention that I am a female and already an adult, it was more than 20 years ago but I kept this within myself for a long time because of shame and guilt I felt. Thank you for this opportunity to open up and be heard.

I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,317,0.98,2023-05-27 01:36:58,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

Found out my daughter is cutting herself,304,0.99,2023-04-25 02:45:47,"I (32F) just found out my (13F) daughter is cutting herself. She said it’s been going on for a little more than a week. Her brother was the one who told me.

She showed me them and they are superficial and don’t need immediate medical attention.

I tried to remain calm and just not overreact or panic. I let her know that I’m sorry she was feeling so strongly that she resorted to hurting herself and I let her know that I don’t think badly of her and I want to help her.

She agreed that she would like to get help so we are going to get a referral from her doctor for a therapist on Wednesday.

She said she does it to relieve stress and when she’s feeling upset but that it isn’t a suicide attempt. I let her know that we need to find another way for her to release stress since this is dangerous.
I took her with me to work and school today so we could spend some extra time together. 

I’m not sure what else I can do. I’m trying to keep it together but I do feel terrible that she is feeling so low. I wish I could take all her pain away.

Edit: *Update*
Thanks for all the support! Even though I tried my hardest to do what was best it still felt like I wasn’t doing enough so it was very reassuring reading through everyone’s comments and experiences. 

We got a referral from her pediatrician so now we are waiting for therapy. In the mean time we have been doing more activities together and she has been a lot more open to trying stuff. 

Yesterday was rough because I spent some one-on-one time with my son (9) and she felt a little betrayed after we were spending so much time together. At first she didn’t want to talk to me but eventually she came around and I told her it’s normal to feel that way and she’s still important even if I spend time with her brother. 

My son has ADHD (and possibly autism, we are in the process of getting an evaluation) so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside. It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn’t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don’t allow children under 15. 

She even stopped wearing her jacket which I felt like was huge so I think we are making good progress.

What the fuck did my older brother just do?,303,0.95,2024-03-30 19:59:59,"Hello. I'll post this because I am really... utterly disgusted and in disbelief of what just happened. I might delete this later or whatever, I don't use reddit that much.

For context, I'm F18. I left our home at the age of 17 to enter a state university miles long away from our home. It takes me months to return home and I came back for a week long vacation (for long holidays) last Monday. Since I will be returning back to the city I'm currently studying in tomorrow, I wanted to at least bond and catch up with my older brothers since I've been away for months. We weren't that close, but I understood them more now since I've accepted to just let things be (again for context, my older brother stopped in college and currently out of school youth).

I was with them (my siblings' room), we were having fun, my 2nd older brother [M21] was in the lower bunk bed and me and my oldest brother [M22] was together in the top bunk. We were laughing and all, playing games, then my brother hugged me while I was playing games in his phone while we were also chatting. It looked sweet to me because we were not really touchy, he's introverted, and I innocently thought that we're getting closer. While having fun chatting and all, he kept on caressing my stomach and asked where's my navel at, and he touched, caressed it so much that I felt gross and laughingly told him not to touch it while still playing the game. 

He then on proceeded to fucking ask ""where should I touch you then"" and unhesitatingly put his fucking disgusting hands on my chest LIKE IT WAS FUCKING NOTHING and whispered ""here? can I touch you here? please let me"" LIKE A FUCKING UNEDUCATED CREEP. I was so grossed out and can't think properly at the moment so I chose laugh it off and got out of their room saying I'm sleepy already and needed to rest since I still have a long travel for tomorrow.

It was so, so fucking creepy since I didn't expect my brother to be like that. In context, my 2nd older brother is just the same. He also did something like that when I was a minor. And I was raped when I was in preschool. I know nothing at that age, but I remember it until now. I allowed that person to do it because I know nothing... I really don't know nothing. I was so vulnerable. I was just a child. When my parents asked why my medical results says that there was blood in my vagina and all, I was so nervous, scared, and got angry at them. I didn't understand it, but in my mind I was so scared if they knew (it's like having sex and telling your parents you had sex at that age). Looking back, it was so gross and I just wanna cry. I don't want to elaborate it further about what happened afterwards. I tried to forget... even until now.

Please... please help. I've been through a lot. Not just this but things way worse than an 18-year-old should experience. Please help me😭 what should I do it felt so fucking, fucking gross like it won't ever fade away even if I scrub all over my body and bath again and again. I feel so dirty. I am so fucking mad right now. I was reminded with everything. Am I still supposed to understand, knowing that these guys know no shit? I AM SO MAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I WANT TO CUT MY WR1ST AGAIN FOR DISTRACTION I CANT WITH THIS FUCKED UP LIFE IT'S HOLY WEEK FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS😭

TW: What they don't tell you about hanging yourself,296,0.99,2023-11-05 18:11:10,"A much needed premise: I miraculously survived hanging myself back in February of this year.

It was not the first time I attempted unaliving myself but it was the first time I was actually going to be successful if things hadn't turned out the way the did.

I had done my research about this. I could not fathom doing it any other ways that I thought were ""too painful and gory"", either for me or for the person who would find me.

So, after that, I was hospitalized for a month and a half and they changed my meds after 3 years and I have to say I am now in a much better mental state and ready to talk about this.

If you ever thought about doing this you may have a picture in your head of how it's going to go. I had it too and it couldn't be further from the truth of what happened.

So here's the reality check:

Firsts things first, it is not ""painless"" at all, it is not ""slowly drifting to sleep"". Your body will get SO MAD that you are doing this and it will react in the worst and most painful ways possible.

To start, you won't have control over your limbs. I remember seeing my arms in front of me with the hands all tensed up like a zombie. It felt like my tendons were slowly getting shorter and shorter and I couldn't move them. I always thought when the survival instinct would kick in the arms would go up to the rope in an attempt to lift yourself up. And it's true that your brain will think that, but trust me, you will have NO CONTROL over your movements. You want to lift the arms up overhead and they just slap around aimlessly.

Then you will feel like your head is going to explode and your eyes are going to pop out. I felt my whole face go warmer and warmer and starting to tingle like crazy.

And that's not even the worst part: it was the lungs for me. You see, your body will get to a state of primal survival instinct where it will do anything it can to just catch a breath. But since the airways are blocked, your whole torso will tense in and out with so much force that your lungs and stomach hurt like hell. Think of a worm curling up when you touch it. Your body will do the same over and over, in and out, each movement more and more painful than the previous one. And it's not like you can control it. You can't. My whole abs and back muscles hurt as if I had fallen from 3 stories for like 2 weeks afterwards just from the effort my body was making by trying to get some oxygen.

I won't even go into how it ends because it's just fucking scary. I'll just say that there's a point where you have the lucid thought of ""I am dying, and there's nothing I can do about it"". And it's the most terrifying yet real feeling ever. It's not ""calm and peaceful"" like you make it out to be in your mind before doing it. It's sheer panic. And when you have this thought it's like it lasts a millisecond but you're now stuck in this state that doesn't leave you.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I feel like some people need to hear this. I certainly would have had second thoughts had I known it in advance.

I won't go into how I survived because I honestly still feel guilty and embarrassed about it. Just know I had to be resuscitated twice and can't remember a thing after that panic feeling. That would have been the last feeling I ever felt. Not peace, not relief.

I am now convinced there's absolutely no ""painless"" way to go and I'm scared as hell for when it will be my time to go in the future. I still have these feelings sometimes, to end it all but I have to admit I am now an official coward.

So yeah, would not recommend. It was NOT worth it. Just delay that feeling for as long as possible, trust me.",mentalhealth,None,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/17ohtpv/tw_what_they_dont_tell_you_about_hanging_yourself/,27,298.989898989899,2.989898989899018,0.0006380792503913948

In that time I watched him do an insane amount of work on himself. We both have mental illnesses but we both see doctors and take our meds. He had some kind of mental break a few days ago. We went to the doctor. Then the hospital (I was flabbergasted they didn’t admit him). Last night it all went to hell. He got hyper fixated on my son. I was very concerned so I called his grandma to take him back to the hospital because I was going on three nights mo sleep watching over him. He thought my my 21 year old son was in his room with his (my partner’s) ex girlfriend. He kept running up to his room insisting he needed help. I managed to get him outside and made my son lock himself in the house. 

Then it came to a head. He started ranting and raving and screaming. I tried everything. I tried pretending like he made sense. I tried begging. I tried singing. Finally I saw his Mamaw pulling in. Then my partner, the man whom until a few days ago I had never even had a real argument with pounced on me. We went down and starting grappling. My glasses flew off.

Please Stop Recommending Pets as a Mental Health Fix,282,0.96,2023-10-04 18:52:42,"I’ve seen this several times under a lot of posts on this Reddit, and I’m not saying pets don’t help. I don’t want to discount the experiences of people who says pets have helped with their mental illnesses, and I don’t want to discredit scientific studies that suggest having a pet elevates your mood.  However, a pet is a living creature that requires a lot of care, and if you are so depressed it is hard to keep up with your responsibilities, a pet might add to your stress rather than helping relieving it. This really reminds me of those couples who fight and fight and they think having a baby will fix their relationship. 

Please remember that pets aren’t props used to help humans, they are living creatures with their own feelings and needs. I don’t want to discourage you from getting a pet, but please only get one if you can take care of it, not just to help with your mental health.

My friend says he’ll never forgive me because I called the authorities for a welfare check after he told me he was contemplating suicide,283,0.95,2023-04-23 13:46:18,"

This morning, one of my best friends called me and was in tears. He spoke about frustration and suicidal ideation. As someone who suffers bipolar disorder, I completely  understood his pain and where he was coming from. I tried to calm him down but then he hung up on me. The last thing he said was “I’m really sorry. You won’t hear from me again very soon. Thank you for everything”
And then for thirty minutes, I tried to reach out to him but I couldn’t. I travelled out of the state for the weekend and I’m 3 hours away. He stays alone and I don’t know any of his neighbors so I was forced to ask the authorities to go to his house for a welfare check. 
They did and determined he was fine. He then called me and said he would never speak to me again or forgive me for doing that. But I couldn’t live with myself leaving him alone after talking about killing himself. I feel horrible like I betrayed his trust but another part of me feels like I did the right thing and maybe potentially saved his life. 
What do I do? He’s not relying my texts or calls. Should I go over to see him when I’m back? Should I keep trying to call and text him?

Not coping from hearing my parents “doing stuff” at night,279,0.96,2023-10-19 23:38:58,"This is gonna sound so weird and creepy I’m sorry I don’t know what to do I really hate how I feel about it and I don’t know who else to tell. Around two years ago or so around covid lockdown time my dad was heavily drinking a lot, he did before and that’s a whole problem in it’s self but I was home to witness it a lot. There was a period of about a month when when he was drunk he would come up in the middle of the night and force himself on my mum , he is already a control freak so me and my brother can’t close our doors and he would keep theirs open too even though out rooms are next door. Basically every other night I would hear this and it would give me breakdowns every time crying panicking and not knowing what to do with myself. For some time I tried to intervene cause I felt horrible for not doing anything which just made it 10x worse and ended up with him threatening to kill me if I ever did it again and our already bad relationship being worse. I tried to talk to my mum she did admit sometimes she didn’t want to (I have physically heard him push her down and her saying no) but she gave me the sex is good talk and told me to leave it and stop intervening. Once it drove me crazy to the point of self harm just hearing it made me feel so sick and I just needed any type of distraction from the sound , it doesn’t help that past 11pm I cannot be awake or watching tv so it’s hard to drown out the noise. That was around 2 years ago now I still live at home and I’m 18 now my dad has stopped drinking but our relationship is unfixable even when I hear anything remotely similar I start that crying and panicking again sometimes it feels like I’m making up the noise in my head and it’s been happening on and off for two years.

My 21F ex has slept with my 20M friend and I am not ok.,267,0.96,2023-07-27 14:32:12,"Long story short, me and my ex lived together over a year and as things were ending, my friend came to live with us as he was starting a life in the area. Shortly after, me and my ex broke up and he decided to stay and help her. She struggles a bunch mentally and really needs someone to stay with her so I didn't find this to be a bad idea.
They eventually started to get super close and I started asking them if they ever might get together. I was wanting to be prepared in case they ever did. My ex claimed that she's not gonna say no and doesn't want him out of her life if he brings her happiness. Yesterday, we were talking more about it and it pretty much came up that they have slept together.


What really hurts is that me and her had a unhealthy relationship and that we hadn't had sex in over year due to what we thought was her mental problems. Due to this and some other factors, I started acting distant in the relationship and she believes that was holding her back from wanting to be physical with me for the last year.


When I found out they have slept together it sent me into a huge panic attach basically running and crying into the woods. Right now I keep picturing them sleeping in the same bed that me and her used to sleep in and it creates the absolute worst feelings I've ever experienced.

Be honest: How often do you think about su*c*de?,256,0.96,2024-03-24 19:26:29,"I know this is a sensitive topic and I am even afraid to talk about it with my therapist

I honestly have no idea if it is normal to think about su\*cide as often as I do. Like not really attempting it, not even being close to doing it. Just thinking about it.

Since forever planning my su\*cide in depth somehow calmed me. Whenever I feel stressed or anxious I think of different ways how to do it and somehow this is the only thing that calms me. Most of the time I think daily about it, on the way to work, when doing housework etc

Is this concerning? I am really not close to doing it, I would even consider myself very stable atm. But planning it, thinking it through, different methods, different settings, I don't know its the only thing that relaxes me in times of stress

Yes it is good to not run away from your fears, and it is good to face them. But sometimes, facing your fears is just not worth it.

But I wanted to say…

Your therapist really does care about you. 

Every time we see you accomplish something or overcome something, we are filled with pride. 

Every time you share your pain with us, we always take a little bit of that home with us. 

We think about you outside of sessions. 

Sometimes we worry ourselves to the point of losing sleep over you. 

You don’t “annoy” us. 

Every time you share a trauma that’s hard for you to talk about, we feel honored.

Sex is disgusting sometimes- I think I might know why?,232,0.92,2024-04-03 14:50:17,"I lived with my dad for a little period of time and did always go to his cottage whenever I was off school. One thing was- he would always fuck his girlfriend/wife at the time very loudly. At some point I started getting really annoyed by it because I would storm out of the house screaming “STOP having sex when I’m here”. It kept happening. I was glad it happened in a different room but you don’t understand how SMALL this cottage was. I could hear everything and that girl would do it on purpose so I could hear it.  They would do it in their room and do it in the bathroom. It echoed so much. 

It was always the have loud vigorous sex, come out of the room with such confidence and going to the kitchen table to have a cigarette and a coffee. That’s the pattern. Daily. Constantly.

I knew she did it on purpose because my relationship was always terrible with the girl. She was jealous of a young girl because my dad loved me. I was jealous of her because I knew she didn’t deserve my dad and that she was pushing him away from me.

I think it got to a rotten point where I got myself off on it because I was so used to it happening every night. I think this part is what is getting me... I was only 11/12-13 at the time doing all of this. It only continued from there until I moved out. There was nothing I could do but wait on the couch and sleep there until it was over. I didn’t realize how fucked up it was to do what I was doing. But truly -because I was so exposed that -I thought it was normal to do so. I think it’s affected me even now just because of what they did- and what I’ve done while that was all happening. I feel cursed. Disgusting. Confused. Vile. Sad. Desensitized. Not normal.

I continue to think about it Til this day, and it grosses me out and sometimes it will pop up in really awkward moments. I feel a rise of anger when I hear any form of moaning or sighing- I get scared or weirded or grossed out while trying to have sex. I will have flashbacks when having sex. I get fear from it sometimes. I hate to be touched sometimes- and it has a lot to do with this.

-I’ve also been through some weird instances where my dad would slap my ass “as a joke”. Who does that all the way up til they’re 13?
- I used to be laying on the couch and I swear to god at some point he was watching porn around me. He was doing it in the kitchen at the table. I know this because I heard the moaning and at the time there was only me and him around the cottage 


-stumbled onto my dads only laptop and found a bunch of legging porn videos.. also stumbled onto his only camera and found nudes of his gf. I’m finding all of this at the age of 11-13 years old.

-edit: my dad and the girlfriend left me alone a lot with the girlfriends son and daughter at the time. The daughter same age as me and the son 16. At the time I was 13. we were in my dad’s girlfriend’s cottage. The son had a few drinks and he started to give me a small amount of attention and sleazily asked me to be his girlfriend that night. Later on he pressures me into giving him a BJ and I do it because I want a boyfriend - and the morning after he breaks up with me. Stone cold. I actually thought we were gonna be together but he actually just used me- then becomes my step brother  a few years after. I think I got really lucky for being the heavier/ fat girl at the time because it would take a lot more for him to take MORE advantage of me than he already did. It was my FIRST memorable sexual experience that was NOT good. He kicked me out of the room right after he couldn’t nut.

I also have a faint memory of being around the age of 5 and playing with a younger boy and we were in a closet stripping. Thankfully we got caught. I asked my mom and my sister if that ever happened because clearly the other mom probably would make a scene out of it knowing what just happened - but they both said they don’t recollect this at all.

It just gets really fucked up. Also people think this is a LARP.. which is really really sad. Because this legit has happened. What am I lying about for. I smoke weed daily just to not cry- I have self harm scars from when I was ten just from crying for ANY form of attention. I have physical and mental regrets throughout everything I’ve been through.

I finally got a therapist that’s good at her job and now I am livid.,202,0.99,2023-07-07 20:05:33,"Alright, I got a story for y’all. 

I had an eye opening therapy session yesterday, and I just wanna share about how I never realized things that happen to us as a child can have such lasting subconscious impacts on us for the rest of our lives. 

Ima bout to get real with y’all, and share an experience that happened to me. 

This is something I have a suppressed memory about it, and because of the way adults have portrayed it to me growing up, I always told it as a haha funny story. These fvckers spoke about it as if it were a joke and now I’m angry.

Something about me, is if I ever feel as though I’m in trouble I shut down. I go non verbal, and it’s hard to come out of. Therapist asked about it, and when I first felt that as a child. I first said something about being put in the corner as a child and if i talked I had to stay longer. But then it hit me. 

As a child, I had pretty bad adhd (still do) and would never stop talking. Got on a lot of people’s nerves. So, one night a relative was babysitting me. I was younger than 5. (Likely around 3/4) I wouldn’t stop talking and bothering her. 

So what does this relative do? Duck tapes my hands and feet to a bed and put tape over my mouth, and left me in a room until my mom came back to get me. 

My mom was livid. Unfortunately she’s passed since so I can’t ask her about it. 

After that, adults, my father included would ride around with duck tape on the dash of their cars and threaten me with it if I misbehaved. 

Every time that story was brought up by the people in my life, it was told as a funny story, so that became my association with it. To this day, it’s brought up as a funny memory. 

I just never made the connection before about it. 

But now, having my own kids and thinking about someone doing that to my toddler, nah I’d be in jail right now. 

That’s not even the worst of what’s happened to me as a child, but now I just want to call my father and tell him with as much disrespect as I can give, Fvck you.

I found my mother dead yesterday,202,0.99,2023-07-24 07:23:54,"I (21F) found my mother (56F) passed away yesterday morning outside in her chair. She was suffering from terminal lung cancer and was in horrible daily pain. She had gotten her diagnosis just a few months ago, and although it was terminal my family wasn’t expecting her to go so soon. We really thought we’d have a lot more time with her. We actually had a cookout planned that day so the family could come over and spend time with her. I can’t get the image of her slumped over in her chair out of my head. Seeing her pale face and my heart just stopping. Trying to wake her up even though I knew she was gone. I feel so numb and I don’t understand why. I feel like I should be crying more but I just can’t anymore. Nothing feels real. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. It doesn’t feel fair. I feel like I’ve been robbed. I have so much anger I don’t know where to direct. My mother didn’t deserve to die so early nor should anyone have to lose their parent so young. These past few months leading up to this I’ve been in a depressed haze, cutting off friends and isolating myself. I was starting to feel the loneliest I’d ever felt in my life but now I think this is it. I have nobody to talk to about this. I’m just so sad. Support or advice would be appreciated.

UPDATE: I don’t use Reddit much so I’m not sure if everyone who replied will get notifications for this: 

I just wanted to post a update and thank everyone who has taken their time to comment and reach out .  you guys have no idea how much all this support has meant to me. These past few hours have been extremely rough. I’m not going to lie, I’m still a bit numb. I just can’t believe my mother, the women I’ve known my entire life is gone. I will never see her again. It shatters my heart all over again every time I’m reminded. My mother was the most caring and beautiful women I’ve even known. The morning she passed, she woke me up very early at 2am asking if I was okay. This was very unlike her. I’d like to think in some way she knew what was coming and wanted to spend some time with me before she left. My best friend and I recently reconnected right before my moms passing, they have been keeping me company which has been really helpful. Surprisingly I’ve been laughing a lot these last 2 days more than crying. I think my mom would have wanted that for me. Although I’m still incredibly lonely and depressed about her passing, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. As my mother is no longer suffering in pain, she’s completely at peace now and where she always wanted: in the afterlife with my grandparents ❤️ 
Again thank you to all the amazing wonderful people who took their time to leave me heartwarming advice and share their experiences. I was losing hope in humanity for the longest time but posting my experience here  has brought me nothing but peace and encouragement. You all are the most wonderful people imaginable and I can’t thank you enough. I really didn’t expect so many people to see this.

My psychologist told me something I wish my parents had told me,192,0.99,2023-05-31 12:44:17,"I'm 36(m), and I went to my first ever therapy session ever.

I opened up to my therapist at first, just snipits of my days and issues, and it turned into an hour of me spilling my heart out and overloading her with information. 

I knew I had dyslexia and showed signs of ADHD, and it has been left untreated since childhood, and now it is affecting me even with the simplest of tasks. 

She said that I have a thinksy mind that overthinks and over exaggerates simple things. She went on explaining it all and trying to help me rewire my thinking. 

Then she said something I didn't expect, she said it was not my fault that I could learn those topics in school, it wasn't my fault that I could not understand those math equations.

Wife is going through breakdown and told me she wants to divorce,192,0.98,2023-09-17 17:59:09,"My wife of almost 15 years (we have been together for 21) decided she wanted to divorce me suddenly before a work trip. She knew I was going alone and would be isolated. 

I spent the first few days in a hotel room in a strange country in complete shock. All the emotions ran through my head. I blamed myself, every little comment said. 

A few years ago she suffered from an incredibly paranoid phase (thanks a lot pandemic) where she thought the neighbours were spying on her and everyone was out to get her. I work away a lot so I'd come home to find her in this state. The ""cameras"" always ended up being garden lights or motion activated lamps, but when I pointed this out (after 6 months not so tactfully) she seemed to withdraw from me. 

After that we had a yoyoing relationship, where she would tell me one moment she loves me, the next a divorce. We always sorted it out because I love her and want to support her and the kids unconditionally. 

I noticed her withdrawing. She would be in the same room with me, but not in spirit. She would explode at me in anger for the smallest things, and the big things she wouldn't seem to care about. 

She decided to go on medication, which helped. Although she became more of a robot and lost all interest in any form of intimacy. It broke my heart. 

She came off of them about a year ago and things started to improve. We became physical (although at the worst of times she would have sex with me and throw it in my face on the next angry outburst, calling it rape etc. I never forced her into sex at all, but did complain we weren't intimate many times). 

So, this latest situation was only three days ago. I'm still in a hotel halfway across the world, but my father rang me this morning. 

Apparently she stayed at a female friend of ours house last night because she thought the neighbours were spying on her. She told me that she is hated in the area and that she will be sent back to her home country (she has been living in the UK for over 20 years and is from Europe) and the kids taken away. She strongly believes it to be true. 

My father picked her and the kids up and she adamantly wanted to report everything to the police regarding it. The police obviously didn't take it seriously. Our neighbours are all 80'ish years old and not malicious. A pain, but not malicious. 

So as I sat here, pulling the threads on everything bad I'd done (because she will often use anything I've done wrong as ammo) when I get a call saying a mental health nurse is visiting her. She's at my Dad's with the kids. 

I love her with all my heart. She's a fantastic mother and person. But she will just torture me over and over and I stay because of this love. I worry about the kids and how she'll cope. It breaks my heart. 

So I just carry on working, supporting her and trying to build our family. I've turned into a persuer it seems, trying to hold us all together. Always initiating conversations. Trying to understand her feelings. She wouldn't make the effort to talk first. 

Did she really mean she wanted a divorce? Or is this just symptoms of her MH? I can't leave her when she needs me, and although this is effecting me I can take it. I want her to be safe and feel better but she's breaking me down with the constant swings in feelings towards me.  She is an amazing person at her best, but at her worst it's like Jekyll and Hyde. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so what was the outcome?

*Edit*

I was arrested straight off the plane. They aarested me on suspicion of Rape and coercion.  I was taken straight to the police station and was just released pending investigations.

I've picked my car up, but I'm not allowed to contact her, go to the house without police escort, go to her place of work (which I wouldn't) go to the school. Where my kids attend or ask anyone to talk to her for me.

I've never raped her. She thinks having sex because she felt guilty whilst not objecting is rape because she didn't really want it. She's saying this happened multiple times. I'm feeling broken

Looking at the past history, I think she has BPD. The re-writing of the past, the annoyances at very minor things. Disassociation and acting. Obviously this isn't a proper diagnosis, but reading it all was a lightbulb moment.  I think I've been discarded.

Sexual encounter has left me utterly broken,171,0.93,2023-10-24 13:19:40,"TW: SA/Infidelity

Saying I needed to go.

Asking to stop and offering oral sex instead. I think I said “If I go down instead, can we stop?”

I know i put myself in that position, I let myself get taken advantage of and I know that I was the stronger person and could have stopped it.

I wonder if I even AM worried at all. Lately I’ve been feeling apathetic towards my mental issues/habits. Hell, I don’t even feel annoyed/bothered by the things that usually annoy/bother me. The worry feels fake, I think. Then again, my “self-aware” thoughts tend to feel fake.

But anyways, I met this person on Discord and we both produce music. I showed them my music, they showed me theirs. They were fun to talk to, and it felt completely platonic. They asked me if I was an adult, and I said I was 19. They said they were fifteen. I don’t know if they’re male or female, but something hints at them being female.

Now, I don’t remember feeling any attraction to this right away, no, I don’t think I did. But I think my mind wants to convince me and say “what if you did feel attracted? Maybe you don’t remember.” 

I never fantasized/thought about them sexually or anything, ever. I don’t like to say it, but I did kind of feel a bit attracted, not even sexually. Of course, my mind doubts that and makes me wonder if I do/did feel attracted sexually. But I did daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually)?

The attraction felt more like a romantic one, not sexual. Still, that should bring concern, but I don’t feel concerned. I don’t even feel concerned that I don’t feel concerned. It seems like my mind keeps getting more and more messed up.

————————————————————————

It doesn’t stop here. I sometimes catch myself “looking” at much younger girls, and daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually, more like attracted to my face and just my face), but this hasn’t happened in a long time. I sometimes avoid looking at them this way, and keep my eyes away and instead focus on their face (which doesn’t make me feel attraction, but of course I doubt this).

”Daydreams/fantasies” on my OWN never feature any underage people. 

And of course, I feel apathetic. But, I do think this whole issue is gonna make it a bit more difficult for me to enjoy things.  I wondered if I’d be able to enjoy dancing anymore, because “yeah that guy dances well, but he’s a pedo, so…”

—————————————————————————

If it’s any help, I’ve never used underage characters (like lolis for example) in things like AI chats, only actual adult characters. I’ve never used porn like jailbait porn or “barely legal” or anything like that.

And I am attracted to people my age. I just wrote “too,” but deleted it, and I think that means something.

I also always have the wrong reactions/opinions, like when people say pedophilia isn’t a sexuality, I feel opposed.

———————————————————————————


Edit: Nearly everyone here has told me it sounds like POCD, but I feel like it’s more than that. I can’t deny that I did daydream of little girls being romantically attracted, I can’t deny the attraction to that fifteen year old.

I told the fifteen year old that I couldn’t talk anymore. I then unfriended them. I felt something when I saw their profile, it was only romantic but mild, I think. Mild or not, it was romantic. It quickly went away once I no longer saw their profile, but still, it was there.

26F: cruel internal voice that relentlessly criticizes anything i think or do. anyone else struggle with this,169,1.0,2023-04-27 14:28:53,"Like if I think to go visit my parents the voice says, ‘you’re 26 and you want mommy and daddy, pathetic.’ If I don’t go see them it’s like, ‘Congratulations, do you feel like a big kid now?’

When I was working, it found a way to tell me whatever job I had was pathetic or that I was pathetic to be proud of myself for a job I actually liked. 

As I ease my way back into working after an especially bad depressive episode, that voice laughs at any small steps I take. Whether it’s waking up early or doing one freelance job, taking on a student. Little steps that feel manageable, that voice is laughing at me like ‘you want a fucking standing ovation every time you do the dishes?”

It’s out of line with my own beliefs about work and value but it completely takes over, like it has the microphone and I can’t think anything else and I am becoming so weepy and panicky.

Why do I get immensely sad when I see an unwanted inanimate object?

This really only pertains to ""anthropomorphic"" objects. Plushies and the like are a good example of what I'm talking about, but if it has a face it's definitely a possibility that I'll feel bad for it. 

Not sure if it helps, but I have been diagnosed with GAD, C-PTSD, and interchangeably with dysthymia and depression. My therapist said that it may be in my best interest to speak with my doctor about an autism diagnosis as well.

I had a child loss. And I am okay.,167,0.97,2023-12-12 20:51:58,"Hi, about ten months ago (Feb) I had a miscarriage. I saw my dead baby. Yes, it wasn’t just a pile of cells. I’m pro choice, so whatever you would like to call it for yourself, then go right ahead, anyways. 

I’ve been struggling a lot. I loved them so much even though I didn’t know them well. I knew how they made me feel, and what they were doing to my body. I knew I was excited and loved them with my whole heart and body already. 

It took many months after my loss to finally name them. I never got the chance to know them well, so naming was hard. I decided to go with Jordyn or Jordie for short. 

The name Jordie comes from my cousin, who I love so much, and is one of my favourite people. And I love the name Jordyn, especially for a feminine person. 

I’m doing okay. I know that it’s not my fault. My baby wasn’t developing properly, and would have been born either very sick, and miserable, or passed away, like they were. 

They are at peace, and I’m coming to that point now. I miss them everyday. But I also have an amazing partner to help me through everything. 

I’m going to be okay. 
One day, I might meet them again, and who knows in what way?

No matter what, I know they wouldn’t blame me, because Jordyn was sick. 

I am still a parent. 
I am still a mother.

Edit: I identify as enby. They/them. Not a woman, but still a mama🩷🩵🩷

Edit 2: one in four pregnancies end in loss. It’s not as common to lose your baby in the second or third trimesters, but it is just as valid. I lost Jordyn in the second trimester. I was supposed to be 15 ish weeks pregnant, but when they passed away, they were only the size of a 7-8 week baby. I just felt like I wanted to share this information. 

I’m also going into grief counselling to help support myself with my journey of not being a mom anymore. There’s a quote that I really love, it goes like this:

“I carried you every second of your life, and I will miss you every second for the rest of mine.”🩵🩷🩵🩷

I also plan on having a funeral for Jordyn in the future, if I still have trouble with grieving. And that’s okay. They were loved, and still are. And even though they were sick, I still see them as perfect.

We found my grandma dead this morning and I feel like it's all my fault,164,0.99,2024-03-16 04:43:14,"My mom, grandma and I live together. Last night I was cooking food around 11:30pm. I swore I heard a woman for a split second. It was high pitched and startled me and I took my pan off the stove and listened intently and heard nothing. I texted my mom and asked if she was making noise . Didn't get a response and went to my studio area . Didn't fall asleep. At 4 30am my mom frantically ran to me and told me to hurry quickly. She had found my grandma in her master bathroom on the ground and needed help turning her over . I turned her on her back and she was dead. 
Blood came out her nose and mouth. Mom was on the phone with 911 . Gave her CPR . And she was just gone. She had been gone, she was cold with no pulse. Unexpected and out of nowhere.
She was fine last night. 

I feel guilty. I had the thought to check on her when I heard that noise because it had me frightened it was so strange of a sound. But I didn't want to wake her up and it was storming. There's 3 dogs in the house . I assumed it was in my head and it could of been. There was no sign she fell and hit her head or anything like that . It seemed she was probably gone when she hit the floor. But in my head and heart I keep saying what if I had went in there ... if I had maybe my grandma would be here still. I hate myself right now . This is the worst day of my life. I lost my papaw and that was bad. But this is something else... I was talking to her last night about how I'd lost weight and just chatting .

My mother hung herself in the woods yesterday.,163,0.98,2023-08-06 02:35:32,"This doesn't feel real and I am going through throwing up and being in denial. My mother suffered from bipolar but was pretty good at masking it around people for most of my life. I just turned 33 and as her daughter I never expected she would be out of my life forever at this age. This year has been terrible because something triggered a 10 day manic episode in January where she basically burned every bridge. Once it was over she couldn't get over the shame and fell into a deep depression. She was hospitalized multiple times but could only seem to be kind of act functional for a week or so back at home and then get so depressed again that she wouldn't eat or sleep. 

She moved in with me and I really thought I could help her but it was a cycle of her acting somewhat hopeful to a deep depression. Yesterday we got into an argument because I found out she has been lying about taking her meds. We exchanged some words and she got into her car and sped away. I really didn't think much of it and thought maybe she just needed space. After too many hours went by, my sibling and I started blowing up her phone. 

I finally filed a missing persons report while hoping she just went to a hotel or something. This morning the doorbell rang with two officers holding their hats. I already knew what they were going to say but they said they were very sorry but they found her body and she hung herself. My brain isn't processing this at all.

I think I fucked up by being honest to my professor...,162,0.95,2023-08-03 18:16:49,"Basically I emailed him asking a simple question about my grade. He asked me why I took ""so long"" to email him about this, because I only saw the grades right now, but they got released two months ago.

In 2 small paragraphs and 4 sentences in total I very briefly explained to him that I got in a delirium today from my cat getting lost and spiraling into a depressive episode from being in a very stressful environment (basically my friends treating me like their therapist). I explained I have issues for which I am on my way to get properly medicated for which causes me, among other things, extreme anxiety to see my grades, and that I hadn't seen my grades in general in almost a year. Therefore, getting in a delirium and becoming deeply unstable and barely holding onto reality, I decided that that moment was the safest one for me to see my grades, because I'd get the least shock from being most detached from reality.

Of course he hasn't responded, I don't expect him to, but I'm scared I fucked up by telling the truth when the truth is... this. I find it difficult in general to lie, but especially in times when I lose control. I was even preparing to lie to him just in case he'd ask me something like this, but I knew I had nothing to back up my lie. And being upfront was kind of the only way for me to actually justify being so late in emailing, because that's just the reality.

I just want to get my degree with my own dignity... I hope I don't make these people hate me forever for being like this and thus stop me from receiving what I study so hard for...

Edit: Before I go to sleep I want to clarify 2 things. Number 1 is that I don't judge my professor at all for not responding to me, I would do the same in such fragile situation. Number 2 is that for me, none of the information I shared were things I ""hide"" from anybody casually (not in a professional setting of course if not prompted). There's a myriads of other things I hide, which are way more severe and unsettling to the average Joe. Sharing *those* things for me would be considered **for my own boundaries** as oversharing, simply because the information I shared is almost my entire life. I have nothing to say about my life if it's not that, which just covers the surface. Of course my definition of oversharing may be objectively wrong, but that's my personal definition of it. But besides the open ended conversation that is naturally unfolding, my main concern is about type of emotions this information could evoke to the other person, such as falsely making them believe I lied, making me look inappropriate to work in the industry, making me look difficult to work with, etc.",mentalhealth,the-fourth-planet,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15hbkih/i_think_i_fucked_up_by_being_honest_to_my/,41,170.5263157894737,8.5263157894737,0.0003639230091670409

This initially started over quarantine because I was stuck in the same house as my family. They like to dig into your insecurities and even made me feel like I’m ugly, so I thought up a girl who doesn’t have those insecurities and was just all around beautiful and imagining what kind of life she would lead. The only one I’ll be going over in this post is “Sasha” which was a name I had liked due to being a big Bratz fan when I was younger and I had hated my name because it’s not very common and not only had an apostrophe, but also has a capital letter in the middle and was often made fun of. Since then, I have learned to love my name and switched her name to be mine. To better describe her and her life, she’s a beautiful dark skinned Afro-Latina woman who has long dark brown hair, she has an hourglass figure, and the most beautiful brown eyes in terms of looks and I often times will stay awake simply imagining her face and wanting to cry or scream. In terms of what she’s like, she has a very sweet personality, but she’s much more confident than me and takes crap from no one, she’s seen as the most perfect woman originally at school and later as an actress. She at some point got married to my dream man and they had kids who were practically the definition of perfection. That was originally just my little escape from reality, but it very quickly started consuming my day to day life because I’ll start thinking about this during important things or shut myself off from the world to get a quiet place to focus on how to make that world more so perfect.

I already know that I need mental health help because of how awful my parents are (Every kid before me has needed mental help too) I, however, need to know if this is something that is concerning before I talk more openly to friends and other family members about this.

Recovering from depression is worse than depression itself,164,0.98,2023-04-30 16:15:53,"I have been majorly depressed for years. During that time I lost relationships, took gap years from college, isolated, missed out on opportunities, gave up on everything I was talented it, and have led a life that I am not proud of. I never wanted to be around others because I knew that I was a burden to whoever I talked to. 


Now that I have in many ways made great strides toward recovery (or at least better coping mechanisms), I almost wish I hadn’t. Depression was comforting in a way. It filled some type of void. Now I look back at almost ten years of emptiness. I feel like dying would have been better because my life is like looking back on someone who was dead. I feel like my life is completely worthless. I understand that the sentiment that comparison is the thief of joy, but looking at the lives of others my age I don’t see the point. I feel like I will never have a full life, like I’ll always be behind. I’ve tried everything. This is one of the first times I’ve really allowed myself to process these feelings and it sucks but I do feel like I need to be honest with myself. Stuffing all this down and telling myself I’m happy just because I’m not depressed isn’t true. I’m not suicidal anymore but I truly do wish I would drop dead or something.

I'm suffering in iraq as a 13 year old iraqi turkmen,161,0.92,2024-03-08 14:29:52,"I'm suffering in iraq as a 13 year old turkmen male pray for me please my turkic brothers

I'm a iraqi turkmen suffering alot and don't trust iraqi propaganda or kurdish propaganda 

Iraq is a hellhole

I suffer daily as a 13 year old

Poverty is quite common

Saddam added his image to all books and he persecuted turkmens

Urban areas are full of beggars

The education here is soooo shitty we get 60-80 hard exams yearly and 30 questions per exam 5 divisions of questions 

We have to read the whole book 200 pages and barely get anything out of it to become 'smarter' out of 1000 questions we memorize we only get 3% of those how useless

My father is exploited by the iraqi government and we can't even go back to our ancestral countries 

Any iraqis who are struggling seeing this i don't deny it because iraq is in bad condition socially 

Iraq has power cuts everyday and 6 times a day

The educational ministry brainwashed all turkic people here explains why they're patriotic 

Christians here aren't that persecuted but 2 governorates najaf and karbala persecute them and teach them their propaganda 

Iraqi conquerors killed 100000 central asian turks and raped 50000 and forced them to join the army and become arabs, this is also the reason why many iraqi turkmens support the siege of baghdad 

If you're wondering why us iraqi turkmens don't seem to be related to iranian turkmens is because we're iranian azeris

My turkic brothers are any of you here for me

I often feel negativity towards iraqis


The education here is VERY manipulative it explains why kids are patriotic

If you do not raise a iraqi flag during a mawtini performance then the school will beat you

And kurds here make policies harming us using fake information and they've kurdified many turkmens in erbil and they stole jarmo from kerkuk and called it 'the oldest kurdish village' while kurds didn't exist at that time

I am an introvert have been dealing with social anxiety for the past three years. I've been through some traumatic experiences through my life.

I am 34 years old man. I have been there for people my whole life. Helping anyone in need. Emotionally supportive. Going above and beyond to help people who are at the lowest. I just want to see people happy and am willing to go to any lengths to make that happen. Never looking for any personal gain out of it....Just waiting for the universe to save me as I have been saving others.

I am forgotten. I know someone is going to bring up self worth and how I am placing it in others and seeking validation from others...but is it too much to ask. I feel I have wasted my whole life. I should have been selfish and just lived my best life and I would have been at a better place feeling more fulfilled.

"""Ugliness survey"" at the hospital exacerbated my body dysmorphia",154,0.98,2023-10-22 11:00:38,"I'm a 30 year old woman. I've struggled with body dysmorphia since childhood, mostly fixating on my nose (which has a bump and is crooked, so there is what you might call a ""real"" issue) as well as a general sort of ugliness that I cannot specifically place.   


This past summer I was hospitalized for anorexia and once I was transferred from inpatient to outpatient, they enrolled me in a few group therapies. One of the nurses in the program had me email her photos of my face from different angles and distributed these photos to ten anonymous staff members at the hospital, and asked them to answer questions like, ""How ugly is this person out of 10?"" or ""How much does this person's nose ruin their face?"" and so on. We wrote the questions together.  


Before she did this exposure I expressed multiple times that I feared I would be at risk of self-harming upon seeing the results, and that I really did not want to do it. I asked if I could opt out and she said yes but continued to bring it up and ask me why I wouldn't do it until I eventually agreed.   


The results came in and were varied. A couple people rated me a ""10"" for beauty, others a ""4."" More than half said that my nose does in fact ruin my face (ratings of 6-10 out of 10).   


These results were very distressing to me, less because of the numbers themselves and more so because I felt coerced into doing the exposure and because there was no follow up or after care. The nurse read me the results, gave me the ""raw data"" and excused me from her office. This was in July, it's mid-October now, and I am still struggling with this information.  


This is of course not the ""cause"" of my dysmorphia, but I'm feeling unable to get past what feels like confirmation of my ugliness. I have trouble leaving my apartment or working while my partner is home because I fear he will look at me and see how ugly I am. It is disrupting my every day. I am in therapy with a general counsellor and also a trauma therapist, so two sessions a week, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the BDD. I also research it and read studies and articles about the disorder to try to better understand it. I consider myself in most ways a very reasonable, giving, dedicated person, friend, and partner, but I am so totally fixated on my ugliness sometimes that I fear I will drive others away.  


I guess I am asking two things: 1. Is there any hope for dysmorphic patients? I haven't felt like I've made any progress over the 12 or so years of therapy, and 2. Is this kind of exposure experiment normal?

I work in a mental health field where part of my job is referring clients to therapy and helping coordinate their care.

Like I made them promises that this would be a helpful thing and then sent them somewhere that did more harm than good. 

I know there are great therapists (I've gone to one), but I've had personal experience with bad therapists too. It's a really harmful thing, because therapy is a very vulnerable space and is not the place where you want someone who has no idea what they're doing. And yet, there are so many providers out there that are really, truly bad at their jobs.

My dad was arrested for possessing pictures of kids,143,0.95,2024-02-08 04:26:04,"This is my first post on here but I need help

My dad was arrested a few years back and was found in possession of child pornography.

(Context)

My dad was a highly respected professional in the teaching field until he was arrested and charged with possession of CP. After discussions with himself, my family and the solicitor who fought his case, I have developed some understanding of the situation. Suffering from trauma in his childhood, he had been searching through dodgy forums etc. to see how these people interacted with one another, whilst simultaneously getting extremely drunk. It was obviously a stupid thing to do and I feel like I have to believe that what he is saying is true as I do want to trust him.

I think back to my childhood, going round to friends houses, seeing their parents not drinking and thinking that was strange. This was only because of the copious amounts of alcohol he would ingest of an evening, from whiskey, to vodka, to endless cans of beer. But growing up and seeing this, day in day out, made me believe that this type of consumption was normal. 

When I initially found out what happened, I had received a phone call off my dad explaining vaguely what the situation was and as soon as I put the phone down, I couldn’t stop crying and I came to the conclusion that I wanted to end my life. I had my note written and I was ready, but in the back of my mind all I could think about was how I would never see my family again - and I ended up calling Samaritans (who were amazing might I add).

Anyway, this was 3 years ago, he was given a suspended sentence and community service, and life as a family hasn’t been the same ever since. He still lives at home with my mum but whenever I go back home, there is just a feeling of constant sadness and all of the happiness that I used to feel around my family is a relic of the past. 

I suppose the question I want to ask is, how do I move on from this? Obviously I’ll always love him unconditionally, but everyday I just feel more and more resentment towards him for the situation he put us all in - losing contact with countless friends and family members, having to prevent him from meeting any of his grandkids, all the looks and comments you get, and I could go on all day.

I don’t want to cast him out but it feels like I’m constantly grieving my dad, fuck, sometimes I think it might’ve made things easier if I was actually grieving him.

I broke up with my ex more then a year ago, during our relationship I hit her various times and I can’t remember how many times nor the details. After our breakup while talking she panicked, I asked her to leave my house and after she didn’t, I hit her and kicked her on the ground, this is the only episode I can fully remember and it terrifies me. 
Nothing similar happened during my previous relationships and I’m not a misogynist or anything of the kind, my friends respect me and when I tried to talk about this they made up excuses and told me she was lying because of her mental health issues. She went to the police and they didn’t believe her, I never said a word to deny it, and I told her I would not fight it if she had reported me, I would have told the truth.
I left the city since then and live hundreds of miles away, I’m trying to rebuild for myself a stable and decent life but this memories haunt me. I can’t spend one single day where I don’t have vivid memories about me being physically abusive and I really have no clue how to move on in my life being this piece of shit.

Boyfriend wants to break up with me if I don’t give him enough sex and now I don’t know what to do,130,0.87,2024-02-29 16:46:06," THIS POST HAS MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

Going through a very rough time right now. I’m suffering from major anxiety and panic.

My boyfriend of 3 years has lost his patience I guess and is basically breaking up with me if I can’t provide him with enough sex. (We’re both in our 20’s looking to live together soon)

I was a victim of sexual assault/abuse as a teen and he knew this from the beginning of our relationship. We’ve always had issues with sex but some months are better and some are just kinda dry. 
He told me a week ago that he can’t sit around and wait til I get better and start controlling my sexuality anymore and I need to give him more intimacy and sex. 

I’m incredibly hurt. I’ve given him alternatives that don’t include me and I would even be open if he would satisfy his needs elsewhere. 
I really want to stay with him because I love him but my only way to save this relationship is to force myself into giving him more sex. We do it every one-two months or so.

Little do I know it blows up. Hundreds of people reassuring me of the situation, over 40 reaching out in private messages, giving me genuine advice and the reality of the situation. It eased my mind and dried my tears. I was in a really bad place and I can thankfully say that Reddit has very possibly saved my life because it could have ended very badly.

There was also a lot of insults in those comments, a lot of people being harsh, but the good outweighed the bad and I didn’t care.

And they don't even pay the consequences of the hurt they created, everyone just excuses them and it's almost wrong if the victims of them feel hate towards them..

We don't even treat children, victims of those parents, with the same respect as animals.
If you were to mistreat your dog you could go to jail and you're seen as a shit person. Nobody would say you "" did you best"". You fucking chose to take care of a dog and there should be consequences if you fail at it..

She got pregnant in feb/march 2023. It was un planned and we decided to keep the baby. I also moved in with her in May. I loved her, I wanted to marry her,start a family together, and spend the rest of my life with her .

I found out a little after I moved in that she was sleeping with this guy while we were dating. We weren’t official but we both made it clear to not be sleeping or talking to other people. I caught her once in September 2022. She said she did it once but did it several times all the way to December. Also found text with her friend saying she loves this guy in February 2023. 

I was devastated when I found out and wanted to move out even though I just moved in with her. She said she was sorry and her excuse was that we weren’t official.

My ex’s sexlife makes me sick,129,0.78,2023-08-14 18:20:06,"I was in a relationship with my ex for 1 1/2 years, at the beginning of the relationship she told me about her sexual experiences which were 2. The one was a cop with an extreme superiority complex. He wasn’t asking her for permission slapped her hard, had sex too hard. She didn’t know what she was doing and just let it happen. 
Our sex life had problems because of her past experience, but after a while she enjoyed it a lot. You could say I opened her the wonders of the sex world. But during our relationship, the thought of that cop experience always stuck with me an made me sick. I get very frustrated and angry when I think about it and start too feel like I need to throw up.
Now that our relationship is over for about 3 months, i get even more sick by the thought of it.
I’m scared that she will go back for him just to have sex. I just hope it doesn’t happen.
Is this feeling I’m getting normal? Should I visit a therapist about it?

Thanks in advance!

I’m in a really dark place after the breakup and thought I can post here something, because I have no one to talk too.
My only real friend was my ex :(


Edit:
Thanks for all the support, but I owe some of you an more detailed explanation of the phrase “wonders of the sex life”. Yes I see it seems sketchy to say that. What I meant, was that she never experienced a partner who cared for her well being while having sex. Like taking it slow and listing to her body. She never had orgasms in the instances before or a sense of pleasure. 
And for all the people saying that she had different kinks and all that stuff. Later on we had our spicy adventures.

I still grieve, yes, but I sensed that everything gets Easier on me

This world has no magic and it's unacceptable.,125,0.93,2024-03-19 14:24:54,"When I was young I found the cheap looking, plastic tiara and rod which advertised as it is for 'enchanted fairy, at discount store, and naive thought was going on. One day I read a novel about a family that can bring the force to shield evil magicians, hidden in remote place of mountainside. I was very into said book with scripture so I actually tried the babbles in the room for over hour while holding my breath, drew my whole force and willpower to do the 'chant and fantastically resulted nothing. Later I got the said fancy rod at mall and read the instruction, was so happy to summon a small friend with it But I realized there's no battery at home. And quickly realized that I have no money at pocket. Even worse it doesn't seem to make me a cute magic familiar.

""How this world is livable without magic..?

""So this was lie, ok but how about that one?

My brain was looking for other option after this big disappointment, and this kind of disappoints, drowned me into deep sadness. It was just lie. The world is lying to me.

As writing this post as adult, still I think it's better to disappear from this world and reborn in fairyland instead. This way of start is just terrible and destined to cause mental illness, all isn't enchanted and I can't do no magic. This cold fact is absolutely drowning me in tear, no life can be reverted from death and I'm hopeless after that, while I'm slowly dying inside of short lived cage, ultimately lose all those cryptic memoires.

At this point, the only reason society wouldn't discard me is my age and perhaps gender. I imagine that if an older male shared my lifestyle and beliefs, he'd immediately be regarded as a loser/bottom of the barrel. You know what I'm talking about. The guy who lives in his mom's basement, unemployed and loveless.

I'm self-centered and selfish, hateful towards myself, yet not enough to change anything. I have no drive or self-discipline to do anything, I go along with whatever can make me forget my reality. My escapism techniques include, but not limited to: binge eating, maladaptive daydreaming, compulsive masturbation, using character AI, obsessing over media (hyperfixations, as I'm autistic too). I spend my days bedrotting.

I'm extremely paranoid, to the point of delusions, at least according to others. I fear that my family is spying on me/my devices. Which is a major source of constant anxiety, considering the kind of stuff I do. The only friend I had is just like me, with the exception that he was capable enough to get himself out of the hole I'm in. Secretly, I began hating him for it due to my jealousy. Our friendship was just him dragging me around while I complain. I'm glad he stopped contacting me - it's less humiliating that way.

And by reading this, you might get the impression I'm someone who had a difficult life. Not really. I used to be one of those 'gifted kids' that learned to read faster than everyone else, got praised, etc, etc. I was used to having everything handed to me on a silver platter, giving up immediately if things didn't go my way. I'm not self-sufficient, I learned how to do my laundry last week.

Every once in a while, I'll make an empty promise to improve. My addictions are a glaring issue but whenever I try to stop, I get reminded of how miserable I really am. I face reality and I can't handle it. I feel furious, anxious,  to the point of having panic attacks. Which leads me back into my vices again. It goes like this - 1. Spend a week bedrotting and indulging in my addictions.

2. What the fuck am I doing with myself? I could be doing something productive.

3. Make the smallest attempt at being present in my life, at fixing something, at existing.

4. ""Everyone's better than you, you're stupid, undisciplined, ungrateful, incapable, friendless, ugly, fat, etc. Why even try?""

5. \*cue breakdown\*

6. Rinse and repeat

I have a classmate who often tries to reach out to me, which I don't understand. She's hardworking, friendly, ambitious, an overall bright person. The complete opposite of me. I politely turn her down, because she doesn't know what she's messing with. I don't want to drag her down.

Because isn't being in your twenties about partying, having fun, banging chicks, etc ?? I obviously figured out that's a myth, and it's only shown in movies.

But although, I'm an average looking guy (not like a super model) but I still somehow can't get with anyone my age. I missed out on love and dating throughout my teen years all because I suffered from autism.

"My sister found out the hard way, that our mom is unreachable.",122,0.98,2023-06-16 04:51:51,"So my mom is a textbook narcissist- always the victim always everyone else’s fault she’s never to blame- she’s an angel. She also has this weird trait where the longer time goes by the more and more she manipulates reality in her mind- 1 documented example was when my sister told her she didn’t want to follow my moms path and get a masters in psychology because “It’s stupid and a waste? what have you done with your degree?” - which was/is true mom has a masters in psychology from a major university. So instead of just scolding my sister she parked in the store
parking lot across from her school- locked the doors and proceeded to beat the living shit out of her raking her forearms punching her face ripping chunks of her hair out…..all while her friend is in the back seat screaming…. she did so much damage in less than 2-3 mins the friend said- and then my mom just drove the 20-30secs to the school and dropped off my sister- told her go to class before you’re late- so of course an 11yr old walking into a school blood dripping from her arms patches of hair missing a swollen face drew some attention-Cps was called and we had bi weekly home visits
for 6 months-when my dad got home he was like”WTF vickie what did you do, my
god look what you did to our daughter” and my mom defiantly said “that little brat deserved it she was being disrespectful, and then proceeded to tell us how rude and disrespectful my sister was and how she deserved it” no empathy or apology-
then 6months later it morphed into self protection and minimizing what actually happened- 2 years later it morphed into something completely unrecognizable of the truth “Your sister was trying to yank the steering wheel into oncoming traffic i had to defend myself while fighting her off “

That’s just one story of the woman i’m talking about-So i’ve known for over a decade that anything coming out of her mouth is either a lie or a manipulation 99.9% not the truth or what actually happened.So for the life of me i don’t know why my sister believes the bullshit that comes out of her mouth sometimes. My sister is in vacation in our mother country and calls me telling me mom told
her a story about how dad would hit me and hit her-10000% false that man never laid a finger on any of us-the only thing he could be faulted with was not believing us and not divorcing her faster.He is the definition of a great loving father- everything she’s not. I fucked up and let the beans spill about how not only
did dad never hit us but mom sexually abused me -i’d wake up in the middle
of the night with her rubbing my feet the rubbing my thighs and i blanked out the rest- she would walk in on me showering -
pull the curtain open and then tell me
how the size of my peen compared to my dads…..about how the time mom made me file a false police report against our father saying he hit her or else i wouldn’t get to escape from her and spend a 4 day weekend at my friends(my dad was in oil&gas industry- being a 14yr old kid getting hit for flinching around her - i took every opportunity i could to escape from her- so i went along with her filed a false
police report and my mom almost got my dad fired from his prestigious job- the real reason was $- my dad had limited her access to their $ and she was pissed about it - wanted to get back at him. So i fucked up spilled the beans to my sister and now she’s so angry she wants to make my mom go to the police and file reports whenever she gets back from vacation- my sister now has a
degree of control over my mom
because she gives her 500$/month and pays her 12k/year property taxes. So i get a call from my mom crying and saying she’ll apologize for whatever she just can’t go to the police and go to jail- while part of me wants that, a friend who used to be a therapist told me “It’s like
you’re both living in the past with her” and i believe him- so putting aside the lies the bearings the S/a, i told my sister i feel it would be better if we just sought out professional help to work through this 20yr old trauma and just cut off contact with our mom, next time we see her should be at her funeral.
You can’t reason with a person like her who never sees herself as the aggressor as the demon as evil incarnate.
When i bring up this fact to my mom “How come 4/5 of us plus my sisters friends plus my friends-how come all these people remember reality one way and you’re the only one that remembers things the way you do? how come that’s the case? and she replied with” $ and your father’s brainwashing “ i laughed hung up and blocked her and told my sister i won’t be accompanying her to the police station- i want to seek therapy and move on with my life. My sister has ptsd and her brain just doesn’t remember a lot of these events me my dad and my other brother are cursed with remembering everything. There’s soooo much more i could put on about her- like specific scenarios where reality=A, and Her reality =ansisiehduehdwjsbsxhehwkdbdush

How can I help my suicidal wife who tried to OD yesterday and STILL won't go to the hospital? I'm at wits end and I'm exhausted,115,0.95,2023-06-17 10:45:19,"Update 2-
They are discharging her. Wtf is she that good at hiding shit or is psych at the hospital stupid. Shes texting me so she's been cleared by psych. She keeps saying I love you, and I just want to scream. Think a thick foam pillow would middle scream? 

the system fails again.  So tired of this I can't take care her mental needs. I just want to shut down I'm so stressed I'm hallucinating vividly. reality is weird. 

I still haven't slept probably won't till way later. 

Why do I even try to get her help when the medical system just doesn't care. 

The stray who I fed and let sleep on the porch came by severely injured. I will spare y'all the details. We have no money nor car for a vet.mil said to call animal control. He is an elderly at least 12 years old feral stray with no teeth. I highly doubt they will spend a dime to save him.

 It like when it rains it pours. That cat let me and only me pet him even though hes been here longer then me. We had a bond. He came home looking for help. I'm glad I was there to help him, he got right into the carrier I put outside to trap him so he didn't wander off. 

  I'm overwhelmed

Update 1- texted the 988 line someone commented. They walked em through calling 911 stayed on the line with me.  My wife is beyond pissed off at me
 She yelled at the emts for not wearing masks in our house.  But she ended up going because the emts told her it wasn't optional the amount she took was considered a suicide attempt. She didn't even look at me as she left.

I know I did the right thing. I should have done it sooner.

OP

She tried to OD today she's only not in the hospital cause she threatened to leave me if I caused her to be in the psych ward again. But she took TWO huge according to her handfuls of her old lithium that for some reason didn't get thrown out. She says she did throw up about 20 minutes after taking them. So no idea how much actually got into her system.

I sat with her all day in her room and now we both have our bedroom doors open so we can hear each other and easily check on each other ,(our rooms are right next to each other we literally talk by simply talking loud) 

She won't go to the hospital I keep begging her. She has been dangerously suicidal for a year EVERY day she tells me in tears she wants to die. 
She says she will make an appt with a psychiatrist on Monday but she rarely ever keeps her psych appointments she always makes excuses even if it's a telehealth visit. Even if she does and they prescribe meds she won't take them. She will for a week and then stop saying they make her feel weird. I try explaining that that is normal and will go away but she would rather stop the meds entirely.

How can I help her get the help she needs? She says she isn't suicidal right now,but that's besides the pint she took a ton of lithium she needs to be monitored.
I'd prefer she go in the morning to the ER and from there the psych ward for medication management. She says she will take the meds if we go through scheduling on Monday but even so it could take months for her to get in to see someone psychiatrists are heavily booked in our area.

I'm scared I'm going to wake up and find her dead.

My friend died and I can't stop playing Valorant,118,0.97,2024-04-01 19:29:32,"I (23F) lost a close friend of mine (22F) last Wednesday. It was out of nowhere. We were supposed to hang out that night with our group of friends, but we didn't get to do that. And surely, it makes no sense to me and it never will.  
  
Since I first got the news, sleeping and eating are hard for me. Coincidentally, she passed away on Holy Week (religious holiday here in Latin America, from Thursday to Sunday) so after the memorial, I couldn't stop playing for 10 hours straight. I had to force myself to sleep to stop playing. I'm lucky enough to have found two people on queue which I started playing with and they made me feel better about this situation.  
  
Since today (Monday after Holy Week) isn't a holiday anymore, I had to start working and studying again. It's extremely hard to go back to the 9-5 routine. I had so many activities before this whole thing and I feel like I can't do them. I can just play Valorant to stop thinking about it but of course, it's unhealthy for me. Whenever I'm not playing, I'm thinking of my friend and my heart sinks. So I choose to play to have a little bit of fun and forget about it for a second.  
  
I'm thinking about therapy, since I'm not used to talking about my feelings nor am I good expressing myself. I know right now Valorant is a coping mechanism of mine and I need to give myself time because it's all very recent. I just don't want to get addicted to it in order to neglect my feelings.

One Bad Trip Changed My Life,114,0.93,2024-02-10 16:32:39,"On October 1st 2013, I smoked some weed. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was laced with an unknown substance. I had a horrific experience. I may have been on the roof at one point. I was all alone, and I live in the middle of the woods, so no one knows what all actually happened. 

Well, a few weeks later, I ended up in the hospital for it. I acted deranged enough that they put me in the quiet room. I was only in the hospital for about a week or two, but I was forever fucked up by that experience. When they let me out, I had to stay with my grandparents because I couldn’t handle being at home for various reasons regarding details of the bad trip. 

During that time, I lost control of myself, and I very violently murdered a few of my family members, and I got put back in the hospital and back in the quiet room by myself.

Now, that last part never happened, but you can imagine how fucked up I was that I believed that I did that. And it still haunts me as if it actually happened because it felt so real. I can still feel my cousin’s little neck in my hands and the cracking it made when I killed him, even though it never happened. I can still see the horror on everyone’s faces as they tried to pin me down. I can still feel my back against the carpet as they held me and cried.

It took about a year, but I got a hold of myself, and I slowly started to be able to differentiate between my vivid imagination and reality again, and I haven’t had trouble with it since.

I despise men and lose sleep after multiple violent incidents caused by them,116,0.78,2024-01-02 14:38:55,"I am 22F. The hatred and anger I feel about men now isn't healthy and I can't stop feeling this way. I watched my boyfriend be attacked from behind while he was in the bathroom and he was nearly blinded/killed. I had to throw myself between them as he had passed out. I was taking punches trying to keep his head protected because he had passed out while the men behind the bar and owner (who didnt hire a bouncer) just watched and shouted and didn't step in. It only stopped after he ran away and I was screaming for help. No one called the police or ambulance I had to call his dad to pick us up  After that incident I havent been able to sleep I got put on 5 pills by my psychiatrist to deal with the trauma and flashbacks. I have never went to a party/club and that was our 4th time out. Yesterday at new years the second time we have went out since the incident a man threatened me for moving a jacket, which I moved so I could sit down (it wasn't his, it wasn't mine, the guy who's jacket it was is up dancing he doesn't even know the guy) I wasn't about to sit on someone's jacket so shifted it up a bit so I could sit with my group. It was moved 5 inches and he had 2 seats of space ). I could feel my anxiety creep up after the threat and my boyfriend told him to calm down, there is no issue here and this man slid up behind me (he was 2 metres away) and started threatening my boyfriend telling him to meet him outside. My boyfriend rolled his eyes ignored him and just put his arm around me and kept talking to the group. At this point I was having flashbacks, I started having a bad panic attack, I couldn't breath, tears were streaming, I was gasping for breath. Boyfriend and his cousin noticed and got me outside so I could breathe where the bouncer came up to say he could understand where he was coming from since he was there first (I still have no clue how me not wanting to sit on a strangers jacket and moving it beside me so I wasn't on top of it is worthy of his behaviour) At this point I was just saying between gasps 'i dont actually care about that I'm just having ptsd I don't need this right now'    bouncer walked away and I was being calmed down between panic attacks. I woke up this morning with intense anger. I can't let it go. IV had enough of grown men not being able to control themselves and being violent over something a simple as a jacket that wasn't even his or someone he knows. I'm going to my psychiatrist soon because I can't keep living like this. I have had an abusive father who abused us and my brother has physically attacked me leaving me with bruises and a bloody nose over wanting to watch football in the living room. It's going to be a while before I get an appointment and I'm just not wanting to go outside for fear of something happening. It's consuming my every thought and I start shaking in anger over my disgust with men.

I've never wanted to smack the obnoxious, defiant, vindictive, disrespect out of anyone the way I want to with her. 

ESPECIALLY when she uses her sweet, innocent 4yo sister as her main scapegoat...

(The behaviors started five years before she had a sibling so it may inflame it, but it is certainly not the cause.)

I am in a perpetual state of anger, defensiveness, sadness, resentment, shame, self-loathing, and dread. 

I can't keep existing this way...

__________________________________________
**EDITED TO ADD CONTEXT**

My daughter is 13yo.  She has been struggling with ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder), ADHD, and HFA since she we put the pieces together when she was about 3.5yo.

The main issue is her ODD.  If you're not familiar with ODD first-hand, it's really hard to understand the full scope.  She has 3-7 SCREAMING tantrums throughout the course of any normal day.  These typically last a minimum of 20 minutes to upwards of 90 minutes.  Not a single syllable of that is exaggerated.  They will start over simple things like me asking her if she washed her hands before making lunch, her refusing to figure out how to solve simple problems (ex: there's clothes in the dryer and she needs to switch her clothes over), or getting caught in a lie (ex: I can see from the security camera that she did X and she will scream and get violent trying to lie about it).  Before we started homeschooling, we were getting phone calls to pick her up at least 2, if not 3, times per week because she was being violent with the teachers and disruptive of the learning environment.  

These are all very literal, real examples. These literally happen every day... since she was 3yo.

We have done ALL the things... psychiatrist, in-home therapist, special needs program at school, different pediatricians, school social workers, read the books, tried the tactics.  We have heard from no less than a dozen professionals ""wow, you're doing all of the things we typically suggest"" -- but nothing works!  (And I'm Sicilian, so discipline is not lost on me.)

You can imagine the toll this takes on our family life when so much time and effort is put into ending her tantrums so we can do things and go places, including canceling vacations, not attending family events, etc.  For the past 1.5yrs, she's started to get really jealous of her little sister (who is currently 4yo) and she is now her scapegoat.  The added stress of having to protect my innocent, sweet little girl from someone she worships is too much.

The resentment comes from how much emotional energy, time, and money we've put into trying to help her over the past decade+ since we isolated the diagnoses with NO return or no change and, if anything, escalating behaviors as the teen 'tude sets in.  It's like living in an emotional warzone and I would be struggling even if I weren't also BPD and struggling on my own.

Hope that clarifies for the people who were asking about discipline, where the resentment comes from, etc.",mentalhealth,Complete-Scar-2077,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15bg64h/my_kid_is_my_main_bpd_trigger_and_i_cant_handle/,120,116.66666666666666,11.666666666666657,0.0002489802480412368

My mom claims she has thousands of bugs crawling on her,104,0.99,2024-02-07 20:00:11,"I don’t know what to do anymore. My mom 54 years old has been convinced for the last 3 months that she has scabies, or mite infestations. I want to let it known that just over a year ago she was in the hospital for three weeks due to a nervous breakdown. She was having “shakes” and “shocks”, the doctors could never figure out was wrong. 

Life was okay for a couple of months after she got better she was off work for 8 months. She went back to work 4 months ago when all of this started. She started telling our house that the animals had fleas, which then turned into mites. She bought medication for all our animals and claimed the were more free.( even with no evidence whatsoever they even had them to begin with)

About a month later she started telling us that she thinks there’s mites on the furniture. She cleaned the whole house, along with all the furniture and starting making homemade sprays to kill the “mites”. 

About a week later she told my dad that she has scabies. She said she found a rash on herself and that she knows it scabies. Instead of going to our family doctor she called a over the phone clinic where she spoke to someone over the phone who said they recommended scabies cream. She then proceeded to buy said cream and use it. She bought it again and used it again. She now uses scabies cream every week. She has these hives in her body, she’s been putting lotion all over her body along with tea tree oil and homemade mixers as well. She also took all the furniture out of her bedroom, along with clothes and anything really. She then took all the couches out of the living room. Claiming they were infested. 

She refuses to go see a dermatologist, or have an ink test done or a scratch test for mites. She has 4 showers a day boiling hot, along with doing her bedding two times a day. Every time she naps she washes them. She has spent about 3 thousand dollars on mattress covers and new clothes. For the first couple of weeks my dad was supportive and helping her. We all put in this cream to help ease her mind. There’s 4 people living in our house. 

Fast forward 2 months and my mother is very un hinged. I’m feeling extremely uncomfortable living with her. She’s constantly picking at her skin and picking at her bed claiming any little piece of dirt she mites is a mite. She’s even been in my room along with my nans looking at our beds for “ evidence “.

I’m currently looking for a place of my own since I simply can’t handle her anymore. I don’t know what to do and neither does my dad. He’s been supporting her, and trying to understand. But now I feel like someone needs to do something. I’ve heard of Delusional parasitosis, and so far everything I’ve been reading sounds just like what’s been happening to her. 

Today I caught her picking at her skin along with putting a whole bottle of tea tree oil in her hair. She has hives on her neck, as she keeps scratching and picking. She pops the bites on her head claiming she can feel thousands of babies all over her whenever she does this. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. As I fear I’m getting more and more worried about her mental health, she’s starting to scare me. I want to be there and support her but I also don’t want to be an enabler. 

It’s hard to talk to my dad about this, as he claims that we should just let her medicate and use the lotion and hopefully they will go away if she will relax. He’s not really helping the situation. It’s also important to note that my mom does use marijuana, and it’s on anxiety and depression, medication, as well as sleep medication. 

I need help on what to do. 

Any suggestions would be helpful.

I was sexually abused when I was 10 by my mother's younger brother and my parents didn't do anything about it. ,104,0.99,2024-03-25 13:55:20,"I was 10 and I visited his house with my mother that winter. We were in their bedroom and having dinner on the floor (his wife, my mom and me). He was on the bed, under a blanket, watching TV. All of a sudden, he calls me to get under the blanket. I didn't want to go but my mom pushed me to go. Then my mom and aunt left the room to do the dishes downstairs. He switched the channel to a religious one where holy songs were being played. Then he proceeded to molest me. He hugged me tightly, tried to kiss my lips, then ran his hands all over my body. I could feel his penis against me. Then he slided in his hands under my clothes and rubbed my private parts. I don't know why I couldn't leave the moment he started touching me inappropriately. I just laid there like a corpse. The trance broke when I heard my cousin come back downstairs. I told him that I needed to go and left. I couldn't speak about this to anybody for the fear of broken relationships. I had to share the house with that monster for the next couple of days. I started developing severe anxiety right after that incident and still hasn't gone away. Although I never spoke to him after that incident, I had to be in the same vicinity because of our familial ties. And it was deeply uncomfortable but I kept shut. 
After 12 years of this, I revealed it to my mother in a fit of rage and she blamed me for not revealing it to her earlier. Her stance was clear that she couldn't do anything about it because it was too late, and it's difficult to pick between your child and your sibling. I was shocked beyond anything by this. When I shared this with my dad after a while, he assured me plainly on the surface and moved on. He continues to share a good relationship with that man, so does my mother. But anytime I bring this up, they try their best to make it seem like it's not a big deal and I should move on because it has been too long. Who is going to make them understand that I haven't been able to process this incident and it ruined what was left of my childhood. I fully understand that my parents' validation to something doesn't define my life. But it's difficult when you live in a brown household. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety since then. There's no way to reverse my suffering. 
I am beyond disgusted and pained to write everything in such excruciating details but I have never shared the deetz with anyone in the past 13 years. I don't expect anything out of this.

I got fired for my mental health today,101,0.94,2023-06-08 22:18:10,"So I got fired today, they’re reasoning was that I had “To many emotional outbursts and was distracting to the trainer and the other class members”. 

Some context, I was in a 9 week training period for a job. I was doing all the work and was one of the top members in my training group when it came to attendance, performance and scores. This class did not come without it’s bumps, we started out with 18 and by week three had 11 due to one particular student who could not grasp the concept of the job we where training for. And when she was told she was wrong she would get verbal and at on point physical. And then we went down too 8 as some drama happened between certain class members and one quit while one got fired. 

Now onto me, these class rooms where small and the noise would echo. I get overstimulated as I have extreme anxiety and depression which I’m medicated for but recently the medications haven’t been working. I just got insurance so I was planning on seeing a therapist but until then I was pushing on like a normal human. I had a few times where the overstimulation made me cry so I removed myself for a couple of minutes with the teachers permission and then I would return. I had a panic attack one day as one of the class mates got mad and yelled in my face triggering a episode. But again I removed myself from the room, spoke with the teacher who said I was fine and returned to class. Everyones performance stayed the same and the duties we where doing did not get affected.

30 minutes and happy birthday to me! 🎂,105,0.99,2023-05-04 03:30:14,"I didn’t think I’d be around for this long, I made a promise to my friend when I was healing and becoming clean and that helped wonders- 4 years ago and now I’m slowly learning to establish boundaries. I’m learning more about myself than I’ve ever before. My parents tell me I’ve wasted time, useless, can’t be helped and why I passed off so much. But looking back from the progress of where I came from to now, I’ve grown tremendously and beautifully- I’ve changed as a person for the better and I’m not in a self destructive state with a better mental health, attempted eating habits, and knowing my limits and self care despite maybe needing asd diagnosis test and an adhd one. 

I now know not to put myself through self sacrifice to help others due to parental trauma and I’ve learned not to beg for love that’ll never return to me from my parents but that’s still a work in process. I’ll eventually seek therapy again for my health but for the time being, I am proud to say- I’m turning into an adult soon. I had matured too early due to absent parenting but that will heal someday. That concludes everything, my promise to not self destruct to my friend ends tonight but I’ll always keep that promise to my heart for the rest of my life.

Is it possible that you get dumber after being in a long period of acute depression/bad mental state?,101,1.0,2023-09-05 12:58:04,"(I apologize for the wording of the question and the choice of words that I made in the post)

I went through a period where I was at an all times low in my life in every way imaginable. For 2 years straight I suffered so badly from depression that I had to quit my job, and university, I shunned all my friends and fought constantly with my family, and my physical health declined so badly that I am battling level 1 hypertension and have gone half bald at 24. It led me to attempt to end my life 4 times and I had (what I assume to be) multiple episodes of psychosis. I am now in a relatively better place (I am back in university and am becoming social slowly). The problem is, I can't do any of the things I used to do.

I used to be great with art, I drew, painted, wrote in my spare time, and even worked as a fashion designer. Now I can't draw a straight line to save my life. I also used to love to go on hikes, ride my bike, and go swimming. I can't do any of it, despite being trained and playing in my school's swimming team from when I was 8 until I was 16.

One of my friends has a history of battling depression and anxiety (and have attempted multiple time in the past). She also lost some function until she started going to a psychiatrist and therapist. I didn't have professional help and tried therapy for months but it didn't do much.

With that being said, what's your experience with regression after depression? Do you think people get ""dumber"" or lose mental/motor functions after being in a long period of depression?

And I think that’s why people romanticize trauma so much. 

But what the movies don’t tell you is that sometimes, you get raped and afterwards you cry and cry cry cry cry in the bathroom and scrub yourself clean. And you go to sleep and then you go to class in the morning like nothing happened.

Yeah my wife wants to leave me,98,0.98,2023-04-21 08:11:57,"I found a letter she wrote that she intended to give to me tomorrow. I was by myself, alone and my house. My wife had left for something I wasn’t invited to and I happened across the letter. 

Basically the whole thing boils down to she thinks I’m unhappy in our marriage, she says she’s unhappy with our marriage and wants to begin the process for divorce.

This shattered me to a million pieces.lately I’ve been dealing with more stress and anxiety than I ever have and finding that letter broke me.

I told her I found the letter and I had left one of my own explaining the mental health issues I’ve been dealing with, apologizing for her being drawn into it and for all the times I tried to cope in an unhealthy way.

my wife is going to tell me she wants a divorce. I do not want a divorce.

Tomorrow is going to be an extremely difficult day for me  (or today at this point by now)

I’ve seen the writing on the wall, I haven’t been the husband she deserves for a multitude of reasons but, she’s been the wife I’ve needed to keep me under control.

I don’t want to lose my wife. I wrote a letter for her explaining in excruciating detail that I’ve been dealing with mental health issues that have otherwise left me failing as a proper husband and consistently letting her down and breaking promises (not in spite of her) 

I know what’s coming and I dread it more than anything I ever have before. Tomorrow is judgement day it would seem and I’m worried about how I’m going to manage without her should she ultimately decide to leave.

I have no intention of forcing her to stay in a marriage she is unhappy in, I just feel like we’ve never really tried to make things work and I want to at the very least try.

We’re going to talk tomorrow about how we are going to proceed and I really just need some support.

I don’t know what her absolute decision will be but based on what I read, she has been done with this marriage for long time

I still love her, she is the only reason I have a degree and a job related to the degree I obtained.

This past March was our 5th year wedding anniversary, I did not anticipate that it could be our last. 

I’ve been stuck in a dark place for the past few weeks and I don’t want to lose my wife.

She seems to think we’ve been living a loveless marriage, which I will accept blame for not fulfilling my end of the intimacy aspect of the relationship. I don’t meant to imply this is entirely my fault however I do accept that in my imperfect actions as a husband also contributed to this situation.

My wife seems to think I don’t love her. I do, more than I could ever explain.

I travel frequently for work and I feel like this has not only contributed to the strife in my marriage but also driven me to the brink of insanity.

I took the job because it was the best offer after I a graduated and I thought it would be in both of our interests for me to take it as it was a significant pay increase compared to what I was making. (I did not make this decision without her)

I think this job has contributed to the downfall of the relationship between my wife and myself.

These next few days are going to be very hard for me, I feel like I’ve matured 10 years over the span of a week, the stress and anxiety have been unbearable. 

I don’t want to lose my wife, she is the light in my life but, I’m not going to try to force her to stay in a marriage that she does not think she can be happy in.

It’s rough, guys and I am not looking forward to our conversation but, I need to find closure one way or the other or I’m going to lose my mind.



***********************UPDATE************************

I have just reopened Reddit since posting this. There are a lot of comments and I will get around to answering those of you I am able to as I am able to.

Just as a little general answer as to how things are at the moment: 

I’ve found peace in this situation and have been preparing myself for whatever the final outcome of my marriage is.

I’ve been staying with my parents for a week, I’ve been getting counseling, I was started in an antidepressant and right now I’m going through the wonderful effects that starting an antidepressant brings.

My wife and I are separating for a year, she is taking our dog and will be living in Iowa with her grandmother for the next year until she has to return for school.

I feel like I’m starting to come out of a lifetime of being on autopilot and feel hope for my future for the first time in years.

That’s all I can think of for now, heads a little fuzzy because of antidepressant but overall mental health is looking up at the moment.

I was sexually abused as a boy,94,0.97,2023-11-09 02:09:01,"Well, that's the first time I talk about it at all. I'm 20 now and I suffered abuse since I cannot remember until I was 11. It took a long time to realize what happened to me was wrong and a longer time to realize I was not the wrong side. Until this, how I say, my mind was a straight up hell.

&#x200B;

I was a shy and isolated child. I actually talked a lot with my close ones, but introvert at all, nothing wrong. I remember when I was around 5, my grandmother told me to lie down with her in the bed. I refused at first, but she insisted so much that I accepted. She then started to talk about things involving sexual organs and how it was important to me to know the female body(remembering, I was 5). She asked me if I had ever seen a woman naked, so I told something like ""I've taken showers with my cousin(my age, call her 'Ana')"". Then she literally pulled down her pants and asked me to touch it, to ""know how it is"". I remember feeling very embarrassed and uncomfortable, and she said something like ""you have not to feel any wrong with this, it's like your cousin, but bigger"". Fucked up.

&#x200B;

Later, when I was 7-8, I was pretty often in her house, since my parents worked the whole day. So I often ate, took showers and slept there. Just to say, Some nights I couldn't sleep because that bedroom made me terrified(I actually didn't know why at this time). My younger brother and cousin(male) also were often there. At this age, she put us together in bath and, honestly, nothing inappropriated ever happened during these times. For some reason, the disturbing things happened only when we were alone, and she developed some creepy obsession with me, I will explain later.

&#x200B;

She had one of those electric massage tools, you know. She liked to massage my body with that, and I liked it in the beggining. She massaged my shouders, arms and feet, and that felt really good. But with time, she started to spend more and more time putting that thing over my chest and legs, until she put it over my genitals. I think that was my first orgasm, because the feeling was so intense and unexpected(also my body was probably aroused by the preliminary contact, but I couldn't know what is was). I had never experienced an erection at this time, but even so my genitals were ""wet"" when I went to bathroom. She made it more times, but not so intense, she kinda passed the tool around my legs and stomach and sometimes put it over the genitals, for a little time. She always told me I was her favourite grandchild, the most handsome, and other kinds of praises that made me feel disgusting.

&#x200B;

Sadly, the signs of abuse started to appear at that time. I became more introvert in school and, sometimes, I really froze when talking to people, and couldn't make many friends. I became aroused too. I felt I had the need of masturbate, not periodically because it felt good, but almost every day led by pure anxiety and that felling that it's the only way you were taught to do. fortunately, I never extended this to other people, but always kept it to myself(actually it fucked my mental health, but I honestly prefer this than become an abuser and victimizing and hurt other people). I remember taking baths with my cousin(yeah, that one I told in the bed) at my 9-10 and I never made any sexual play or talk with her. I only had a bit of curiosity about her vagina(also she about my penis), but those thoughts faded away when we started playing of throwing water at each other and make silly beards with foam. Those are actually good memories, which is kinda ironical in my opinion.

&#x200B;

So I hit puberty. I was 11 and, for privacy reasons, I told her I didn't want to take my baths with cousins or brothers. Anyways, she was until in the bedroom(there were a bedroom and bathroom, no door between them) and it was not a problem at all, I've taken many baths with she watching before. One day, After I finished the bath, I got up to shower the foam off and asked her for the towel. I always made this, but that time, well, I had an erection. Not first time, but first in front of someone. Well, she basically touched me very inapropriately, not going to give details here.

&#x200B;

I took baths there only a few times more, until I stopped totally to go there and stayed alone in home. In these days before I took this decision, her obsession about me and my body became sick. when I was in the bathroom, she started to massage my body and making awful comments about my penis. Yeah, some sick things like ""how can something be so thick, do you do exercises for it to grow?"", ""the girls will be crazy when you put this in front of them"" and ""your girlfriend will be a very happy girl with this"". Sorry for the girls reading this. Uh, my parts are actually very normal, and it's not a problem to me. I really care way more about feelings and caring than the body, and I'm pretty sure I could only stay with a girl if she felt the same. But now I know that she was doing had never to do with caring or increasing my self steem, but some distrubing way to catch me psychologically.

&#x200B;

Still in this bath part, she touched me very times, in the whole body. One day she took my phone that I had left in my pants and started reading my personal messages. There was really nothing I should be worried about, but it made me very uncomfortable too. Another day, after I took my clothes off, she said me to wait because she wanted to take a bath first. So she undressed in front of me and I obviously had an erection. She didn't touch me but I could see by her face that she was very satisfied producing that. That day was the more disturbing. After she finished, she told me to get in(She got out and dressed first, fortunately) and take my turn. I did, and when I get out, she told me to lie down in the bed, because she had noticed I had ""a rash on my inner thighs"" and she needed to see it. I honestly cannot describe what I was feeling. A mix of anxiety, fear, and somehow, arousal. When she pulled my towel off, I had a full erection. She put an oinment in my thighs and then started with that twisted comments about my body, penis and girls. So she put an oil in her hands and started, you know what. It may feel disturbing, but she moved her hands so passionately over my testicles and penis that it really looked like she was pleasing herself. I knew I should stop that, I should run away and tell someone, but at that time I felt so, uh, horny maybe, that I just couldn't stop it. I feel it extremely disgusting, but I think whoever experienced an orgasm knows exactly what I'm talking about. Well, then I came in her hands and that was the last time I went there.

&#x200B;

The last part was the worst of all, no doubts. I was in later middle school and I had always got the best grades in every subject, but my grades ""suddenly"" decreased to hell. To worsen the situation, my math teacher was very harsh and blamed me everytime for getting bad grades. I stopped doing things I liked before and lost 30kg (66 pound) in a very short time. I got also kind of addicted to porn, since it was the only thing that could distract me even for a few minutes. The rest of the time was pure torment in my head. I also had nocturnal panic and some weird things like imagining that there were demons or monsters in my bedroom. My family is evangelical, and it didn't help me much. Everytime I went to the church, I could feel anything but shame and guilt, feeling as I was not worth of being there. And, since I had not friends or someone I could trust to open myself, I always ended up believing those thoughs were true.

&#x200B;

When I was to get into middle school, I moved to other school. It's not necessary to say that my mind was not healthy and I couldn't make lasting relationship bonds. I was getting good grades again, but no one of my friends of that time remains close to me today, except by that cousin, Ana, who studied with me in high school. We had a good friendship, and our talks are almost always about music, school and politics. Since we are relatives and were very close in childhood, she felt ok to talk about sex with me sometimes, but always in a respectful way. Her concerns were most about having sex before marriage, and I said her if she wanted to be with her boyfriend for life and both felt ok with that, it shouldn't there be any problem(she's with the same guy until today and they are happy, I feel really glad for her). Today she's in 2nd year to become a psychologist. Sometimes I think about talking these things with her, but I really don't feel secure to open up.

&#x200B;

In my last year in middle school, I got really depressed. I lost my will to live and have a future, I didn't got into college and abandoned all my social circle. The only thing I did in this time was work, go to church and sleep. Despite my shame feelings never left, I always prayed to God to help me, at least, don't give up on everything. I think I'm doing well actually. 

&#x200B;

In my 19, I took my drive license. I thought I wouldn't be able to do it, due to my high anxiety level and a almost constant headache I have, but I did and I drive pretty well. I am also going to do exams to get into a college the next week. I'm not full confident that I will pass but I promised to not desperate and try again next year if I fail. I also found a girl that became one of the most important parts of my life. We are not in love yet, but I can feel she likes me the same way I like her. She laughs at all my jokes and pay attention when I'm talking, and it really makes a great difference. I don't struggle with thoughts like ""if I had found someone like her before I could have avoided a lot of suffering"" because I know that find someone like her is very rare and, anyways, she turns my days way lighter and brighter, and hard things have become easier to do. My greatest fear was how my body would react when we got close. I'm not talking about sex, and I don't want to think about it until the marriage(we're both evangelicals so it's ok), but normal physical contact. Fortunately, I discovered that I like her touch, and stay close feels very confortable, like the opposite I used to feel. I'm not gonna lie, I still have nightmares, flashbacks and panic, I still struggle with porn sometimes(very very few times, but when it happens I feel like those days), but I'm doing my best. When I feel depressed, it's like the time around me had stopped and I don't have forces to do anything, but I'm taking less time to recover than in other times. I've made good friends in the church and work, and the familiy of my girl is like a second family for me. Well, today my life is divided by fews days when I feel absolutely hopeless and some days when I have force, even feeling bad, shameful and empty I can do my best to have a future when I'll be free of this.

&#x200B;

PS: if someone is worried about my brother and cousins, they are all well. I really don't believe they went through this things, I've always kept an eye over all of them to not let the same thing that happened to me happen to them, and they are all ok, both physical and mentally.

**the most important thing that makes you different and unique is that you care.**

"Today, a random man saved my life.",90,0.98,2023-11-22 14:54:34,"The last few years have been escalating and escalating.

I berated myself for not being where I wanted to be. I blamed myself for every single failure, and couldn't see a way out. I pretended, I masked, until I allowed it to continue spiralling to this point. I spent months in utter silence, rejecting any support thrown my way.  

Today, an academic advisor from my university did not show up to a very important meeting which I barely managed to fit in before my deadline. I was at a breaking point, feeling that I somehow just needed to summon every last bit of energy in myself to deal with the irritating and never-ending minute problems of every single day. All these minute things had become far more important than anything else.

So, this happy, queer, and relatably autistic and disorganised man I already vaguely knew took me in instead. I'd seen him before, he had forgotten something he needed to submit from me, some silly admin thing. We had laughed about the fact that two severely ADD people would forget about this tiny thing months and months on end, having the same conversation every 6 months when the dread would pop back in our minds. 

Today, he took me in. Nonchalantly, the busiest man I know just went ""Since you're already here, come in! No problem."" 

He not only heard me, but he told me exactly what I needed to hear, and he probably has absolutely no idea. I know he saw me. He never blamed me, he never made me feel ashamed of myself. In the few minutes after he had noticed that I was sitting outside an empty office with my advisor missing, he already went to find all information he could on me so that he could give me the best advice. He told me I mattered, he told me I belonged, and he gave me the one thing I felt I had lost; he reminded me that I do have control over my life. I can decide where I go. It doesn't matter that my path doesn't look the way I thought it 'should' (whatever that means), and that it doesn't look the way my peers' do. 

Leaving that office, after a mere thirty minute conversation with him, I walked 2 hours before coming home, before sitting and writing a thank you to him, and before realising that he had just saved my life. 

You have nothing to lose by knocking on doors when you need it. Do not underestimate what help can do for you, no matter the scale of it. That's it; this nice friendly academic advisor. Not my meds, not my psychiatrist, not my doctors, not even my loved ones. You never know - life is just as capable of sending you a lifeline as it is capable of sending you difficulties.

I can't stop thinking about my brother,89,0.97,2023-11-08 01:31:25,"Hi everyone.  
What I’m about to write will probably be super confusing, disgusting, and weird. But, I have no one I can tell and so, I’m here on Reddit telling strangers. 

  
My(21) brother(19) is always doing explicit sexual things in front of me. Not entirely explicit, but explicit enough. He likes to go around the house naked. He comes in my room and stands by my bed and waves his dick at me. He asks me if I want to suck it. He comes in my room in the morning with morningwood and in his underwear. At random times, he’ll come in my room gully dressed, but grabbing is crotch and asking me to stroke it through his jeans. He always comments on my body and always tries and sometimes does grab my butt. He says, word for word “You have such a fucking juicy ass” “Get on the bed” “I’m gonna fuck you”. He moans our names and will randomly be sitting their and moans “oh oh I’m gonna cum”.

  
There’s so much more but in the moment I can’t remember.

  
Now I know, the simple solution to this would be to lock my door. But he will break down my door.   
Or I could tell my parents, but they already know and they don’t care. They say “he’s crazy, there’s nothing we can do about it”. They don’t understand that my brothers actions are effecting me mentally. Another solution would be for me to move out. But, I love my mom and if I left, my dad and his family would emotionally and mentally abuse my mom. Which is not something I would like. However this is probably what I will do in the near future.

  
I’m not here really looking for a solution though. Especially since I do plan on moving out in a year after saving some more money. I’m here just to put how I feel into words, especially in regards to how it is effecting me. I didn’t realize just how badly my brother doing this was a effecting me until recently. I’m an avid romance novel reader. However, I can not get through the romantic/explicit scenes in books anymore. My brother keeps popping up in my mind and I immediately have to close the book. I can’t even masturbate without his image. And it turns me off. I don’t think I can even have someone touch me or hear sexual words without my brothers face coming in my mind. 

  
It’s killing me on the inside and I don’t know what to do. It’s disgusting and I’m trying so hard to block it out, but I can’t. I just want to have fun, live life, read a damn romance book in peace, but I can’t.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that I am female, as some people are wondering. Also, it seems like people think that this post is some sort of incest porn fantasy. Which to me, sounds outrageous and honestly pretty hurtful and it seems like people are trying to invalidate what goes on in my life. But this is my reality. I find my brother absolutely disgusting, however, I huge part of me feels helpless.

I've been trying multiple pain meds and depression meds that have not helped, though I've learned to manage the pain without meds. 

The issue is, that I've been noticing a slow but steady deterioration of my mental sharpness, I don't feel as mental sharp, feels like a slog to come up with ideas or even basic things.. like coming up with conversation topics or keeping up with conversations. I have EXTREME short term memory loss, sometimes I bring myself a glass of water and can't even remember going to get it.. or remembering what I just said in a span of 5 mins. I also have a tough time recollecting broad information. At the start, when it was milder, I thought it was a normal aging process, but as I got worse I couldnt help but think there was something more going on and Im extremely worried this will only get worse with time. Brain fog and feeling stupid most of the time.. and while I don't want to make myself seem full of myself, but I felt I was an extremely smart and sharp kid. I can barely recognize myself

We were discussing something related to germs. I can sometimes be “overly clean” and a bit of a “clean freak” which sometimes crosses the line into unhealthy and causes me anxiety. 

My fiancé is a white male. And although I don’t recall exactly what was said before my therapist  made the racial comment, I think i was   talking to her about how when we go to our Friends’ houses I often get picky about what I eat, drink out of etc.

Anyway, I forget what was said directly before she made this statement, but at one point my therapist said:  “Well, you know White people can be a little …..” . And  either she finished the sentence with “not that clean” OR, she made a face suggesting unclean. I honestly can’t remember, but her tone and body language made it very clear what she was suggesting. She was assuming it was a white person’s house and was essentially saying “Well maybe you being picky about those things is justified since white people can be a little nasty.” 

People are very comfortable talking to me, and in this case I think she got waaaaay too comfortable and slipped and shared this thought/bias like I’m just one of her friends.

I honestly  don’t think she is racist or meant any harm, BUT the comment was troublesome(for my reasons below) and I don’t think I want to work with her anymore. But I really need therapy. Should I stay or get on the hunt for someone else?

Why am I not allowed to exist??,84,0.86,2023-12-10 10:01:12,"I'm sitting in a shopping mall and every time someone walks by me, I can literally feel their thoughts:

*""wow, what a weirdo, I wish he wasn't here""*

Like I'm not doing anything bad! Stop judging me people! 

I almost want to shake the people around me and ask, ""what?? What do you want?? Why do you hate me? Why am I not good enough?!""

I'm extremely exposed and sensitive. Everyone can see how disgusting I am. And their judgement very much affects me. I'm submitted to them, like will some of these strangers actually validate me and allow me to exist?

Even worse is when someone does something that my shame doesn't let me do. Like talk loud, breathe loud, take up space.. Like stop that! I would call the police on these people.

Seriously it's very unfair that I'm so mindful of how much I ""exist"", while they just push through. It should be illegal.

Traumatized by being tasered and handcuffed by police during wellness check,85,0.97,2023-05-25 13:35:36,"Has anyone else ever been apprehended by police or had force used on them during a mental health situation and if if you have how do you cope with it? If you haven’t, what do you think about this and would you cope?

So a few months ago I called 911 because I felt like self harming. First I actually called something called here 24/7 which a mental health hotline and they told me if I want to self harm then I should probably call the police. 

My partner was with me and called with me and we both told the 911 dispatch I was feeling like self harming and I had a small kitchen knife to my thigh but I didn’t cut yet.

I told the 911 dispatch I was afraid the police would hurt me because I know they are aggressive sometimes and I work for the newspaper so I hear about what happens. She reassured me that are coming to “help” and I’ve had the police called by neighbours for arguments between my bf and I before and usually they’ve somewhat helpful, one time they even brought a mental health counsellor so I thought it would be like that. I just wanted some intervention to help me get out of that crazy head space.

So when the police came barging in they were screaming drop the knife (I was holding it to my leg lol) and I said no ONCE before I could even look up they tasered me. They had a riot shield, a gun and a taser pointed me at me when they came barging in screaming at me. Mind you, this is Canada.

The police officer who tasered me kept apologizing and saying to my bf “my friend just died like this and I panicked” or some shit. Like wow. The female cop there and the EMS told me there is usually a lot of deescalation tactics before that like they try to talk you down and stuff but they didn’t and they usually ever use force if they feel in danger. They told me to file a report against them because it was  very abnormal and they felt sorry for me. Imagine. 

They told me to and my mom told me to file a report and even get a lawyer because guess what when I got to the hospital they told me the police wrote on the report I said I “wanted to die by suicide by police” like yoooo I said the complete opposite to the dispatcher!!! I was AFRAID of them hurting me. I would never ever say something so foolish and I am NOT suicidal. So, they told me I should clear my name because it’s not safe or good at all to have that on my file and next time something happens they’ll be even more aggressive.

But I didn’t wanna relive the trauma so I didn’t (stupid) and fast forward to this week a neighbour called cause my bf and I got into a huge fight and I had a mark on my head cause I self harmed by hitting my head against the wall. They asked me and him if I was suicidal and we both said no not at all. They didn’t even ask me to go with them in the ambulance like usual for the mandatory mental health check, the paramedics came and asked me if I wanted to get my HEAD looked at and I said no. The police said ONCE “you’re going to the hospital for a check” and I was holding my cat in my arms and said “I don’t want to though” once and they literally attacked me so fast twisted my arms so aggressively and handcuffed me. I was crying yelling like WTF I WILL GO VOLUNTARILY U DONT NEED TO HANDCUFF ME UR HURTING ME. It was horrible they hurt me so much and dragged me like an animal when I kept saying unhandcuff me I will go voluntarily….if I had known they were gonna do that I obviously would’ve just went. Why would I want to be handcuffed and treated like that? I’m not that crazy.

I was at the hospital for 10 hours alone with no phone waiting to be discharged bc there was only 1 ER doctor and my bf “couldn’t handle being there and needed space” or some shit.

I *think* I have trauma due to movies my father puts on,89,0.83,2024-03-06 04:11:50,"TRIGGER WARNING: MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FEARS 

I don’t want to use the word trauma incorrectly but I said it because I feel like I have symptoms of it.

The story is that since I was around 12, my dad would put on movies that involved women being sexually assaulted and abused. They bothered me but they didn’t horrify me as much as when I was 16. That year my dad put on two movies called “Hollow Man” and “Sleepers” which are also movies that also featured sexual assault but for some reason these movies made me cry the most and still scares me to this day (I’m 19 going onto 20 now). The scenes of these movies essentially come back to my memory randomly if I get too deep in my thoughts and it rattles me. It’s been so bad that the horror even affects me when I am in public. I feel uncomfortable when people look at me and I worry they may try to hurt me or even my loved ones. The thoughts of the scenes and the idea of people hurting me and loved ones like that plague me more now that I am studying so much and sleeping less. It also makes me anxious whenever my father puts on a movie to the point I google the plot to mentally prepare. I tend to watch kids movies because I know that will be safe.

However, I am becoming older and will soon have to have my own life outside of my parents so I am more afraid of stepping into this scary world myself.

2) not showing interest in MY interests. When I was growing up, my parents (esp. my mom) didn't really show any reaction to what I liked.

I think I’m being emotionally abused and I don’t know what to do,82,0.98,2023-08-09 11:49:33,"I’m 35F and have been married for a decade now. I’m Indian and this is an arranged marriage.

Within 3 months of my marriage, my husband got to know of a past relationship of mine, something I hadn’t shared with him. I was no longer in touch with my x and it seemed pretty pointless bringing him up. But this was something he was (and still is) unable to overlook. He made me call my parents, my brother and threatened to divorce me, leaving everyone in a bad spot within our community.

Of course, the divorce didn’t happen, but thus began the unending emotional abuse. From gaslighting, twisting my words, to blaming me for his depression (since knowing your wife has an x is valid grounds for depression) he covered the entire nine yards. 

Things got better late 2021, I’m not entirely sure why. I think it was because thanks to Covid, we were forced to wfh, be with each other for hours on end. He possibly saw me for the person I am - and not what he made presumed I’ll be.

Flash forward to today. Last night, he wanted to get intimate. But having worked 12 hours at a high stress job, plus the extra effort to take care of his parents (who are currently visiting us), my cup was empty.

"Bipolar - mixed episode - If I have a strong urgency to send nudes to random people, what should I do?",81,0.88,2024-01-10 04:41:06,"Yes, basically what the title says. I am fully aware that it could be dangerous to me and while I'm still at it, I want to have some kind of preventive measures because I'm really about to lose my mind right now. I'm kind of pissed at basically everyone in my life at the moment, even at my own crush whom I perceive as a kind of savior (to whom I normally send my nudes). What should I do to release this tension BUT in a safe way?    
(I did ""share"" my nudes to two strangers previously -- regretted it afterward, felt unsafe)

Edit: STOP DM-ing FOR NUDES!!!!!! I’m gonna block y’all

———————————————————————————
ADDITIONAL EDIT: just wanna give a few updates from after talking to my therapist and after reading some of your suggestions too. (I haven’t read all of them esp the very recent ones—was planning to reply to them, but I’m losing all my energy now as it’s 3 AM here already in my place). A little TMI, I’m also diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder.

Here’s what my therapist said: [ … You can send it to your friends, or post in anonymous Twitter account with 0 follower. You can take as many as you can (to get you distracted) then back it up on your Cloud/Drive account. Send it to yourself is also another alternative. Make sure those photos do not feature your face. Better yet, keep your phone under lock & key and only retrieve it when you are calmed down. Hope it helps. You got this! ]

What I did by far:
1. Creating a spare insta account with 0 followers, started by uploading my normal, non-nudes selfies, ended up not sending nudes at all because I was too busy looking at my selfies and uploading them right before I got to open my hidden nudes folder haha (sorry if it sounds too cringeworthy—kinda feel cute these days). 

2. Impulsively uploaded normal, proper selfies to a subreddit and somehow felt better about it (except for some of the disgusting DMs part). Hope it doesn’t sound narcissistic but, it felt good looking at the number of DM requests though I didn’t reply to them [BUT I truly don’t appreciate some of the DMs coming from this particular post from r/mentalhealth because, apparently, those people intentionally take advantage of me and no, I don’t reply to them :)]

3. Talked to someone, felt good. Made up with my crush, had a good talk with him and he said sorry for not being there for me for the past few days. Had a video call with him as well.

After (1) and (2) I felt calmer, and after (3) I felt amazing.

WHY I TRY HARD NOT TO POST MY NUDES:

[I saw some of you suggesting me to post on Reddit with a throwaway account without my face on, or creating an OF account, or sending it to friends.]

Why I clearly avoid doing that: as weird as it may sound, I’m actually just trying to honor my idealistic principle of thinking that nudes = exclusive, I particularly take them for someone special and send them only to that particular person.

When I said I wanted to send nudes this morning I didn’t take anything new—I was about to send my old nudes from a few months ago. Which was taken for my crush.

In my previous experience, I had to send my nudes at least to 2 or 3 people not out of my will, I just kinda got “groomed” onto it or because I couldn’t clearly say no—only to regret it afterwards. Wasn’t even thinking of my own safety at the time, I was solely disappointed at how I “betrayed” my own principle (NOT betraying my crush, since I’m not yet exclusively in a committed relationship with him anyway). Yeah I’m idealistic AF.

And this I guess is my very first time, for whatever reason (seeking validation? Wanting some tension? Not sure, I guess the first one) I want to share my nudes when (presumably) I’m about to enter my hypomanic episode (in my previous hypomanic episode I was about to fuck random ass dudes, thank god I canceled the plan). And that’s why I was very confused, by my brain was still alerted that I shouldn’t be doing that at all.

"is it OK for a father to slap his
daughter's ass as a joke?",81,0.84,2024-02-25 18:48:46,"I'm a 20 years old only child, and my father has always been like this. I remember he'd try to kiss me on the lips when I was 7-10. When I got older, I began refusing because I understood that it's not a normal thing that fathers do with their daughters. He's also touched me inappropriately a lot of times. Every single day, he wants a hug and a kiss and gets mad at me whenever I refuse. He also keeps asking me to sit on his lap. 

It makes me extremely uncomfortable. Is it normal, or am I just overreacting as he claims? He says that it's him being ""affectionate."" 

He'd also sexually assaulted me by, it's so disgusting that I don't even wanna type it out, but, licking my nipples when i was 8 and asking me to touch his yk what. My grandfather - his father - has also done this to me, but I stopped seeing him after I turned 10. He even almost forced me to touch him in the middle of the street until I screamed and he let go of me. Neither of them knows what the other one did, but I guess it does come by genes.

My parents divorced when I was around 10-12, but it wasn't for this reason.

Why does this happen to me? Why couldn't I have a normal family? Now I'm 20, I've never had a boyfriend because talking to guys makes me uncomfortable and every single time a guy is acting nice towards me my daddy issues start acting up and I feel like he's trying to get something from me. I'm so desperate for a relationship at this point, but I'm also too scared to commit to one. 

And the worst thing is that even tho he's done unspeakable things to me, I still want to give him a chance and forgive him. He wasn't a bad father besides being a pedophile. And I hate myself for it, but I just want my dad to be my dad. It's not a surprise if i confess that i feel attracted towards older men than guys my age, and it disgusts me. I keep searching for a father figure in every single man that I meet. Whether it's my teacher or a bus driver. But deep down, I know that the only man a girl could trust with her life is her father.

Broken man biking across Canada-Update,82,1.0,2023-06-11 16:50:09,"Quick who am I. 
I am a 320lb man suffering from severe depression and other mental/physical issues and a month ago I decided to jump on my bike and pedal my ass across the Country. Well, almost across. Moncton NB to Vancouver. 

I'm unsure how to link previous posts maybe someone could be so kind to do that for me in the comments? Or just go to my profile if you're interested in reading more. 


***TRIGGER WARNING***
These updates are raw and real and I talk openly about my struggles with depression but also how Cycling effects those struggles. 


What is a 40lb update you may ask? It's the amount of weight I have lost in 4 weeks. 

When I left Moncton I was 320. I weighed myself yesterday and was 279. 

My jaw dropped. I knew I lost weight, I could see it and feel it. But forty fucking pounds?? 

I was with a host, my first host on this trip and he and his wife were so kind and so accommodating, I truly will remember them both for the rest of my days. It humbles me and as he seen first hand, I'm a very emotional dude. Depression has broken me, but their kindness broke me too and what they did for me will only fuel the fire that under me right now. 

But 40lbs!!! 

When I set out to do this the goal, as you may all remember, was to end up in BC a different and a better man.  A strong man both in body and mind and I can see and feel the changes now just a month in. 

There was a moment when I thought this was having zero positive effect on my mental health, but I was wrong. Everything that could go wrong had gone wrong and yet I still wake up each morning and head west. The other day I found out my EI claim was denied, I went into the bush and sat there thinking this was it. I formulated a plan in my head. Simple, quick, painless. Like I've thought about a million times, except this time for the first time the darkness passed in minutes and not hours or days. 

Imagine being in a dark room, it's pitch black, scary and noisy. Usually after hours or days i just find myself standing outside that room. I don't know I got there but I'm there. Outside the darkness and the noise and I carry on with my day. 

This time was different. As I was sitting there in that dark room the noise was being drown out by thoughts of and the feelings of energy and enthusiasm and excitement. I cannot explain why or how this happened, it's never happened to me before, but I found myself in my head with my thoughts being able to feel the positivity and, well, the light. 

I was outside of that dark room but after minutes and not only did I find myself outside of the room I was running from it, the energy I felt was like poitive emotions at war with the dark and destroying them so fast. 

I called my sister and told her I'm continuing, this can still happen. The world is changing around me, I am changing. I can do this. 


It feels like I should not be surprised by this but since that day the world has given me my two new friends in Ottawa who filled my bags with food (my gracious hosts) its given me a new supporter who just so happens to work with MEC (huge outdoor supply store in Canada) and had offered to help with gear, bike repairs, solar charger, ect. across Canada and has continued to give me an amazingly supportive community via reddit and Insta who message and share and even donate. 

This trip is me getting my self in order, becoming a better man so I can then advocate for other Wards of the Court who are like me, broken and lost. 

This journey has shown me that despite the darkness the world brings, there's always light around that corner and all I have to do is keep pedaling. 

There are days I don't want to, but I have to. Too much is at stake. 

I'm hitting Ontario today. This is when the real long slog starts. 4-6 weeks before I get to the other side. I'm taking the #11 all the way to the #1 going to put my head down and just pedal. 

Pedaling through adversity.

Struggling with Depression? Don't Forget About Your Dental Health!,77,0.99,2023-07-18 12:00:01,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share a reminder about the importance of taking care of your dental health, especially if you're dealing with depression. I know firsthand how easy it is to neglect our oral hygiene when we're feeling down, but trust me, it can have serious consequences.



For years, my depression kept me from properly caring for my teeth. I often relied on sugary snacks or even recreational drugs to cope, which only worsened the situation. Yesterday, I finally went to the dentist after 6 long years, and I was shocked to find out that I have significant gum disease. I could potentially lose my teeth, and the dental fees will take me at least a year to pay off.



If you're reading this and realizing that it's been a while since your last dental visit, and if you have the means to afford a checkup, I urge you to go. Dentists are there to help, and they won't judge you. Trust me, they've seen it all. Taking care of your oral hygiene now can save you from expensive dental procedures and years of pain in the future.



I understand that not everyone can afford dental care, and I apologize for not acknowledging this privilege in my initial post. So, instead, I would like to encourage everyone, regardless of their financial situation, to do what they can for their oral hygiene. Even if it's as simple as committing to brushing your teeth every day or making small improvements, it can make a world of difference.",mentalhealth,Acceptable-Point4378,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/152whsn/struggling_with_depression_dont_forget_about_your/,7,77.77777777777777,0.7777777777777715,0.0001659868320274912

Why I’ll never cry in front of a women again…,74,0.85,2023-08-08 00:23:49,"When I was around the age of 13-15 I was going to a middle school event on a Friday night, where there would be a whole bunch of fun activities to do. 
On the way there my mom was driving me and as we got there she decided to tell me that my uncle had actually committed suicide a few weeks ago. Hearing that he passed almost a whole month ago and not being told this really made my heart sink to the bottom of my stomach and the only thing I could respond with was “oh”

Anyways after I was dropped off I was obviously completely confused and upset about the whole situation but I tried to keep myself calm and collected, and went to go find my friends to go hang out with.
Everything was going fine at first, I was distracted by my friends and all of the fun games and activities to do there so it was overall pretty fun.

There was a lazar tag inside of the gym in our school so there was a giant line of people who were waiting to play and me and my big group of friends decided to wait the long line, as time goes on we get to the front of the line but I didn’t realize that I was going to be the only one left out because there were already a few people in front of us that got in before we did and I had to be left out, so I waited for them to get back and I went and sat on the stairs.

As I was left alone with my thoughts I started remembering about my uncle who I had suddenly been informed had committed suicide and I was on the verge of tears so I was trying to hide my face in my knees. 
As I was sitting there with my head down a group of 3 girls had noticed me and came to talk to me (after 10 minutes of me sitting there without anyone talking to me)

Anyways they decided to come up to me and ask if I was okay and for some reason hearing those words just made me absolutely break down into tears and I just sobbed into my knees. I tried to speak up but I was choking up on my own tears which made the one to talk to me look confused.
The worse part about this is when I was trying to breathe but I was hyperventilating and they straight up just gave me the cold shoulder and walked away. 
How could you ask someone if their okay and see they are obviously not doing okay and then just leave them there without trying to talk to them?

My sisters mental illness is destroying my home life,71,0.97,2023-08-02 02:01:01,"I never post my first time visiting a sub, but I would truly appreciate some genuine kindness and feedback from people. My sister’s mental illness is tearing my family apart and I don’t know what to do. 

Also, just as a disclaimer, as her only brother/sibling, I obviously do care for my sister very much, but she makes it difficult to maintain any kind of positive relationship. I am in no way on here to drag her, and will not be using her name. 

My sister, who is 34 now (4 years older than me), has suffered mental health issues since she was a teenager, but it came to a head her senior year of college. She had a manic episode on Thanksgiving Day of 2010, left campus, passed out on the side of the highway, and wound up in the hands of the highway patrol. I’m still super thankful she had the wherewithal to call them/anyone herself, I hate to think of what could have happened. The details are still pretty sketchy, but are not the important factor. She was never the same, and was almost totally incoherent for a solid month after in the psych ward. She has basically been in and out of psych wards around the state at least 2-4 times a year in the ensuing 13 years since. The original diagnosis was some sort of medical gray area schizo-effective bipolar disorder, but I believe it has evolved into borderline personality disorder. 

She ended up leaving her career over it, and is now disabled. Every year that passes since she started getting her disability checks, her health has gotten steadily worse. On top of the issues I’ve stated, she’s also severely overweight and diabetic, can’t handle her own finances, has had a bunch of issues with her thyroid, and her meds either completely sedate her or throw her into a non stop mania, and she is incapable of functioning for days/weeks at times because of it. 

My parents were totally unprepared for all of this. My sister was an honors student, had all kinds of accomplishments to be proud of in high school, and sort of seemed to have her life planned out when she started college. I know no one does, but no parent is ever ready for something like this to happen, it was and is still pretty traumatic.

My folks still look after her (she has never been able to live on her own) and she puts us all through the wringer daily. I moved back home 2 years ago when I was on some truly hard times. At first it was fine, and I learned to be patient with her. Now her attitude has become so vindictive to the point she assumes we all hate her, and that our own mother has a vendetta out to screw her over. She’s completely delusional about this, and I’ve had some arguments with her over it when my temper boils over. I’m not going to let anyone cuss out either of our parents (in front of me AND them). Our mother is her power of attorney and controls most of her savings at this point. It’s just the way my sis talks about her, you’d think our mother beat the hell out of us as kids or something, it’s some truly nasty shit she says. 

She is struggling now more than I think she ever has, her mania and mood swings are so bad that she’s delusional and angry all the time, every day. It’s getting very hard to keep being patient, and to stay at home through all of this. My parents and I have all agreed that this behavior is making us all miserable and sort of codependent with her suffering. Sister is making all of our home lives very chaotic. I get to hear her screaming or sobbing at the top of her lungs nearly every day, usually directed at me or whoever is home. And I’m not sure she even realizes it or cares how she’s affecting us. In turn it is making me callous to her entire condition. It’s hard enough to even be at home witnessing her being this disrespectful. This means if I’m not working 50-60+ hours a week, I am at home arguing with what’s left of my only sibling and watching her life fall deeper into the shitter. 

Sister is supposed to receive a deal on affordable housing very soon, but we all of course seriously doubt that she will be able to take care of herself. None of us know what to do. We assume she will move out and be back home again within a few months and in even worse shape. And it especially wears down my retired father, who she has been truly awful to in the past few months. 

I guess the point I’m getting at is that I can’t figure out what to do now. I feel like if I move out, I completely waste my opportunity to save loads of cash so that I can buy a home. I have begun saving, and it is quite possible by next spring if I keep working and saving. But if I stay, I also have to keep dealing with this... I think it’s fair to say she will never be “cured,” and that the best she can hope for is that it gets more manageable. That also seems unlikely. 

I went back to online therapy recently, and am considering going back to my old in-person therapist to work out some of these issues and other personal problems I’ve had over the past few years. My sis and my parents have also totally rejected going to family/group therapy whenever I bring it up.

"I’ve cut sugar, porn, video games, alcohol out and still struggle with social paralysis",70,0.93,2023-08-01 02:06:44,"I’m a 29 (M) and I’ve never had a girlfriend or wife which causes deep pain.  I’m having a harder night than usual and feel the need to vent.

In the past couple of years, I’ve completely changed certain parts of my life.  I’ve cut out porn, video games, bad food, alcohol, and recently - even sugar.

Something that doesn’t help my situation is I don’t like myself.  I don’t like that I have essential tremors (shakiness) in my hands.  I don’t like that I have some acne on my neck and back.  I don’t like that my personality is not the type that’s the “life of the party” for lack of a better word.  I don’t like that I have some redness in my eyes unless I use special eye drops.

I thought by cutting all of that out, routinely working out, and dressing better - that girls would approach me or show cues that they’re interested in me.

It is fucking hard to swallow the idea that nothing will change unless you basically start immersing yourself in your fears.

I guess this post is not about finding a solution, or finding a “silver bullet”, but I want to vent and maybe hear from people with similar problems.

"I am not proud of my job, ashamed even, I feel like 'less' of a person, and possibly for no reason. How could I get out of this?",70,1.0,2023-07-12 12:50:27,"Hi all.

All of my life I had ambition, I wanted to be an artist in video games, I got there but it wasn't quite right. But it was still awesome. It was awesome for 2 years until I was made redundant in the recession. Since then I needed a job, any job, and I landed a job as an artworker. (for artworker think of graphic design, but the difference between a chef and a cook as being the difference between an artworker and a designer)

I like it well enough but all I do is practical problem solve, I don't do anything creative, I do the practical side of the business. So we have a logo that has been updated, it is now my job to get it updated on 10,000 documents. It is challenging sometimes but most of the time I feel like a factory worker. 

The thing is, many would love my job, many would like the simplicity of just doing practical work not creative stuff. 

But I feel ashamed of it. Like I wanted to be an artist, but now I just push buttons, noting unique or creative. Not many designers could do what I do because it would bore them, and they wouldn't think analytically enough to do this kind of work. But they still think they are superior (and have shown it).

A new job sounds like it is the way to go but I have no idea what togo into, and I earn 30k which is kind of where the cut off is, I could be a designer and earn no more. So my wage isn't even bad (no great in a cost of living crisis, but not bad either).

I just don't feel right?

I got divorced last year and it messed my head up, I am so envious of friends who are in the military but I am 35...I can't do that. And I gave up my chance because my ex didn't want me to do it. 

&#x200B;

I just don't like what I do, I feel embarrassed by it. Im not a designer or an artist I am more like a technician at best. I feel like I have up opportunities to do other things because others didnt want em to do that and I put others first naturally. 

It has gotten to a point where I sort of don't even want to open my eyes in the morning. I am ok once i am moving more or less but in the mornings i am bad. On m drive to work today I fleetingly imagined just turning the wheel and going off the side of the road. Just because it would put an end to this monotony. 

I don't want this to be my legacy...making forms for clients...but I don't want to jump just because the grass may be greener. 

I just feel lost. And ever since the divorce I have been feeling worse and worse.

I ended up abusing alcohol and drugs and getting sexually assaulted and bullied a lot. I finally had to quit uni since my gpa was too low after two years and finally transferred to a community college. I passed, i got my associates, and now im sober.

I got fired because of my mental health,68,0.95,2023-08-21 21:40:03,"So I only worked at this job for a few months but never called out I have ADHD and depression but I still came in even if my depression was bad at the moment. This week someone very close to me had a stroke they already had a stroke a few weeks before that and I and the family believe they may not make it. I was really upset but I did work that day so I went in and tried to push through. I was able to do my job I just wasn’t as talkative with customers (I worked in retail) so the next day I was supposed to work I had a mental breakdown it was bad it was a mix of that situation, financial situations, my relationship, my best friend leaving for basic training, etc and I was just so overwhelmed I had a breakdown I was balling on the floor I was hyperventilating I couldn’t breathe my bf told me he will call them and inform them of the situation and that I cannot speak due to this. He gave them a call and told them I was having a breakdown I cannot speak on the phone and that I am in no condition to work today this was 7 hours before my shift (when I have these breakdowns they last at least the entire day but it's very rare when these things happen I usually can hold my composure) so he got off the phone and said ok so what I’m gonna say may upset you and I’m very sorry and I knew immediately. He said that they said “Is this like a long-term thing because we need workers who aren’t you know. that. so we are gonna end her employment because we need employees who can give their best attitudes and show up to work if she wants to apply in 6 months she can but she has to be happy and healthy” I was just flabbergasted I didn’t even know what to say this was the first and only time I called in. The store wasn’t short staffed and there were 2 other closers there so I already had coverage and since it was Night Shift it was gonna be very slow. I just am not sure what to even think about this.


Edit: when I said this week I meant last week I forgot today was Monday this whole thing happened yesterday on Sunday I apologize for that

Another edit: thank you all very much for your advice I read all of it and took it all into serious consideration. For those saying my bf should have just said I was sick you are all right. I do believe he was in a panic due to the state I was in I actually showed him all of the comments and he agreed if anything like this ever happens again at another job I will just say I am sick and then I’ll explain my reason IF they ask I don’t like to lie about why I am calling out I’ve always been an honest person but seeing some of these comments made me realize that sometimes you gotta just say “I got the flu” or something I actually will talk to my bf because we do live together if we should take legal advice or honestly just leave it as it is luckily because we do have rent so I have to work my bf messaged his boss if they could hire me at his job and they scheduled me for an interview tomorrow so hopefully it goes well. I was told by him we cannot work the same shifts due to the risk of us breaking up and causing drama in his work environment which is perfectly fine with me.

Is it normal to conclude life at 30?,69,0.98,2023-07-26 23:56:16,"I'm 27, I'm from London UK, I work a job that goes against my personality, I have maybe 2 friends at most, I have never had a girlfriend for the entirety of my life & I don't think I ever will. Growing up I was never diagnosed for my mental health but I'm convinced I'm on the spectrum for autism due to the fact I've dealt with Body Dysmorphic Disorder since as early as age 4 & used maladaptive daydreaming as a coping mechanism to this day. Safe to say my reality is not meeting up the standards, I feel like I've plateaued in life when it comes to improving my mental health. 

I'm turning 28 in November & I have never left the country once, never really enjoyed my 20s due to the fact i can't adjust to social cues. Everything feels forced with me, I used to think I was ugly growing up & I relentlessly focused all my energy on improving my physical appearance. Safe to say now I think im handsome due to the change of reception I get from women but I still don't believe it due to how I was treated by them when I was younger (PTSD perhaps?)... The breaking point for me now is knowing my Mum may never see me have a child at this rate, she is ill & currently disabled in her mid 50s. It breaks my heart all the time knowing she wants to see her grandchild & I also want this but I've always hated myself so much to the point I could never comprehend letting a woman into my life. I feel like I can offer physical attraction, mental wisdom & a reassuring outlook on actual relationships despite never being in one. But outside that, I work an average job, I've got no friends, I'm a virgin, I can't drive & I'm limited on what enjoyment I can actively bring to a woman due to the fact I've never experienced much in my life. This itself has recently stopped me going for a woman I really admire even though she is also going through her own grievances. 

I've always told myself if I just had a taste of what life a normal person gets to enjoy, I'd be way better but I'm yet to come close to those necessities.  I'm inclined to end my life at 30 if I'm yet to develop & change. I can be the wisest in the shed, without experience I have no proof for my brain to validate a fixated behaviour pattern of normal functional living. I am saddened at the idea to hurt my mother further by ending my life at 30 if I'm to be in the same boat but something in me can't accept how people have it easy in life & I don't even have the basic privileges to even live life.

I feel trapped & I feel burdened by my brain, I'm tired of rationalising all the time. Tired of relying on dopamine from content or being reliant on endorphin release from the gym to feel positive. I'm putting a positive front but deep down I'm dying inside. People can say it's ""depression"", but like I said if I haven't experienced anything my brain has no proof to feel validated, for example it's like labeling someone for laughing because they got tickled. Granted the circumstances I'm in, feeling the way I do is a reasonable byproduct and the fact I persevered with low self esteem for my entire life, it shows I'm far from just dwelling over the idea of depression.  

All I can say is, I'll be taking it to the next level  but I'll be open about my experience. If this doesn't work then nothing will work for me.

Why is suicide wrong?,70,0.86,2024-01-09 18:30:07,"Just a disclaimer, I'm not suicidal. I sometimes have suicidal thoughts, but I would never act on them.  
  
So I have severe social anxiety and I find it extremely difficult to relate or fit in with anyone. I oftentimes feel like I'm only doing things just because I want to have friends and fit in with a certain group of people, and it makes me confused about my identity; who I really am, what I value, what I like or don't like, etc. It's like a self-imposed peer pressure. Everything I do, I'm always asking myself, ""Why do I want to do this? Who am I doing this for?""  
  
For example, I got my first (ear) piercing last year and told my therapist at the time about it. At first, she was concerned that I did it because I felt like I needed to in order to fit in. I told her that I actually wanted to and that it was something I was thinking about doing for a whille. She said it was fine as long as I wanted to do it.  
  
So how is suicide different? Why is it wrong? If you genuinely wanted to kill yourself, why shouldn't you do it? What if you just don't want to be alive? What if you just hate it? People always say, ""Do what YOU want to do,"" but why shouldn't I kill myself? Shouldn't I be doing what I want to do? It's my life and my choice, so how does anyone have the right to tell me no, it's wrong? If I wanted to kill myself, why shouldn't I be allowed to do it?  
  
If people have the freedom to do anything they want with their life and they decide that this is something they genuinely want to do, why is it always frowned upon? ""No you shouldn't do it. Your family will hurt. It's selfish."" Well, it's MY life and MY choice. If I didn't want to be here anymore, then I think it would be selfish of others to try to convince me and force me to keep me here. If someone is genuinely suffering and they just genuinely wanted to leave, how is it not selfish for others to tell them otherwise? What gives them the right to take that choice away from them? If someone wanted to walk into a clinic that offers assisted suicide, why shouldn't they be allowed to do it? Why aren't people given the freedom to choose whether they want to live or die?

I think I’m getting abused ,68,0.88,2024-03-04 22:56:43,"Hey so I’m going to make this quick. Am I 20M overacting or is this just plain disrespect?

Atp you can clearly see that I’m bothered by it with my facial expressions. We were downstairs in the kitchen (my uncle sleeps on the couch near the kitchen) and I told her to keep it down because I didn’t want my uncle to hear her calling me a b**ch which is embarrassing and yet disrespectful. She says “I don’t give a f**k that he’s sleeping” and continues to say it. I haven’t done anything wrong for her to keep calling me these names and I’m very confused. She broke up with me because I “disrespected” her by touching a CLOSED ramen packet without washing my hands. What’s going on? I’m really hurt by this situation as it just appeared out of nowhere. I am nothing but kind to this woman. I just bought her on dates, went to family functions and have been treating her with nothing but respect.

So during the ride he was talking about his hurt knee...then went into how his life is unraveling.   So I sympathetically listened to him....halfway to the destination he starts complaining of chest pains. I asked if he was OK and needed assistance. 

So I pull over on the shoulder of the highway...call 911..then proceed to make him comfortable..keep him calm and alert while we waited...all while checking his pulse and etc.  He was starting to have more pain...then nothing...no pulse.  So here i am...in the back seat performing cpr until the paramedics arrived...and were able to us a defibrillator and revive him.  Then off they went blazing in an ambulance.   He is only 42....2 years older than me.   

I don't know how to feel.  How to process everything.   The police and paramedics told me I might have helped save his life...and how great it was...and listening to uber's safety manager telling me on the phone how I did a great thing and so on...

PLEASE HELP! I am mentally disabled snd my mental health care and medications have been taken away with no warning for no reason. What do I do?,67,0.92,2023-06-06 10:47:31,"Hi! I really need your help in figuring out what to do in this situation. First off, I am disabled because of a myriad of mental health disorders. OCD, CHRONIC PTSD, GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER, BIPOLAR DISORDER, PANIC DISORDER, and ADHD. 
I am a patient at a telehealth corporation called Eleanor Health. I had been seeing the most amazing, kind, compassionate,and caring psychiatriast I have ever met in my life for since December. She was also giving me DBT therapy.I was rapidly improving and on a path to a great place mentally, until it was all taken away. 
About three weeks ago my appointments with her started to be postponed. I was instead scheduled with a nurse practitoner who had no knowledge of mental health care whatsoever. There was no explation of why I could not see my doctor. My medications were being shuffled around, or threatened to be taken away. This past month has been one of the most stressful months of my life not knowing what was going on. 
They finally put me on the schedule with my doctor June 1st. I had no idea that this would be the last time I was allowed to see her. She was very heavy hearted as well, and it seems as if someone above her was causing this. She also had me on adderall for ADHD and this was taken away without warning. This was also not her decision.
She told me I needed to get my medical records because she had taken careful notes regarding our sessions together, and my marked imorovement with the therapy, adderall, and other medications.
I am now in limbo. Going thru heavy adderall withdrawl. I cannot get out of bed, I am having severe deoression, crying fits, severe anxiety, my nightmares are back, feelings of hopelessness and despair, dread. Feelings that I’m worthless, uncontrollable mood swings, I have lost 15 pounds in the past two weeks, at times I can barely form sentences, also my haur has been falling out and this has never happened.
They did not offer to replace my psychiatriast. Only said I coukd only see a nurse practioner.
This is blatant neglect, derelection of duty, and absolutely goes against everything Eleanor Health claims to be.
I am a total mess. It is difficult for me to do anything right now. 
I am usually pretty thick skinned bc I’ve been thru A LOT, but this is destroying me. I have brought all of this to the attention of the providers at Eleanor health thru a chat in this portal thing and have been ignored completely.
And this has nothing to do with insurance coverage or anything that would make sense.I guarantee you.
What do I do in this situation? Who can I contact for help? Please. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I don't know where to begin, or even why i'm making this post. I just can't sleep and need somewhere to get my thoughts out.

I will start by saying he wasn't just my ""step dad"", he was my father. The man I remember growing up with, looking up to and seeking hard advice from.

My last goodbye was over the phone, I slept for most of that day in denial or.. something. I saw him afew times before that in the hospital, told him I love him, how much he means to me, things I never got to express. But it was only during that phone call when I felt my heart spill for him..

Then he passed that night. And i'm stuck with the wish that I just really said everything he means to me, to him, face to face.

That being said, he was a man who understood, without the need for something to be said. I know inside he knew how much I care, how much he loved me as one of his own. The pain is wishing I spent more time with him, talking, sharing, laughing. My own mental health always got in the way of that. 

I cannot express how much I love him for understanding that, knowing there was so much I wanted to say to him but couldn't find the words for. He just knew I loved him so much.

He died surrounded by my unbelievably loving mother, his parents, and his sister. Im glad to say he was a man with absolutely no regrets and filled the lives of all his family and friends with love, care, and understanding. I love you, Chris.

I feel like im the butt of a life long joke and everyone is in on it,65,0.99,2023-08-31 02:16:56,"My whole life I’ve desperately tried to make connections with people. I scrape the bottom of the barrel and pull up what little hope and courage I have left to show people so that I may gain a friend or anything that last more than a week.

Here I am. A 24 year old guy with no friends or any sort of communication. I go to work, come home and sit and stare at the fuckin wall. All the while my mind is endlessly reminding me of how im pissing my youth away. What else can I do? Im trying so hard to make friends. I have 5-6 dating/friends apps, I try messaging people but it either lasts a few minutes or blocked/left on read. I try to go out and talk to people irl only to be left there in awkward silence. 

I think im losing my mind. First I blamed myself. Maybe im too ugly. So I changed my hair, my physique and how I carried myself (even though I liked how I looked before) nothing. Maybe im not a good conversationalist. So I changed how I communicate with people. I stuck with asking about them and their interests and try to find points of similarities. Nothing. 

But now im starting to think half heartedly that I have the word “avoid” written on my forehead and im the only person in the world who cant see it, or this is all one big fucking joke. Like my face is plastered all over the place with a description saying “if you see this man, avoid him. Treat him like he doesn’t fucking exist. If you match him on tinder unmatch immediately. If he walks up to you with a slither of hope in his eyes, rub dirt in them”.

Im actually going insane. This isnt about sex, fuck all of that shit. I just want to belong. I want friends I can share great memories with. But now im so far gone that I bask in my depression. I loathe in hopeless feelings of loneliness. Maybe im just unlucky. Not everyone can have a cinderella story I guess.

URGENT HELP NEEDED. Kept my friend from suicide for the last 6 years - I don't know how to stop him anymore.,65,0.97,2024-01-28 22:26:59,"I'm super stressed right now and I've been feeling sick for a long while today. Help me.

My friend and I are both turning 17 on February 6. Because of our joint birthday, I see him as the similarly-aged brother I never got. He lives in Australia whilst I live in Norway - yet it has never kept us apart.

We both struggle mentally, but he's on an entirely different level. Having been sexually assaulted at a young age, a manipulative, severely mentally ill mother, abusive relationships within the family, being involved with drugs and then being the one who has to fix it all for his messy family; he's understandably tired and has threatened suicide for every single year that I've known him for.

I've always promised to get him out of there when we turned 18. Whenever he was having a manic episode or just being unwell in general, I told him that giving up now isn't worth it considering all of the years he's been dealing with this - yet we're just one year away from breaking off the chains. He has always believed me.

But today I got the unfortunate news that his mother wandered off and overdosed on valium. The valium HE was prescribed for HIS mental health issues. I'm so pissed about it. According to the doctors, she's not well and she might die. This is worse than anything he has ever endured and it was the last thing we needed right now. I've send him messages wishing him well, saying that I hope he's okay and that he can vent as much as he wants to me. No response.

I don't know if any of them are alive right now but I fucking pray to God that at the very least he's alive. I love him so much, more than words can describe. I'm shaking so much yet I can't cry cause this is not an unique situation.

I don't wanna say it but.. *If* he comes back to tell me what's up, what can I say to make him feel better? I'm exhausted.

It's been 9 days since I received a call from my nephew (my best friends eldist) telling me that his Dad was dead. Luckily, my girlfriend was helping me pack as I'm moving from Colorado to Georgia to go live with her. So she was physically there for support for that.

I spent years dealing with panic attacks and debilitating anxiety but haven’t had one in 7 years. Here’s what I learned through self-healing without medication. I hope it’s helpful to others.,65,0.92,2023-05-31 06:19:40,"•	Anxiety and panic attacks were something I was experiencing, not something that I “had”. Letting go of the idea that this was a disorder or something I had to deal with for life was really important.

•	Meditation in the beginning felt impossible because my Nervous System was so disregulated that my mind and body didn’t feel safe when I gave it space to heal. Persisting was the single best thing I ever did for myself.

•	I didn’t have any self-love or self-care. I realised I didn’t know how to say no to people or things. I was constantly busy and exhausted. I would make myself available to others when deep down it didn’t suit me. Starting to say no was really hard at first but it has been the second best thing I have ever done for myself.

•	I realised I had been operating from my head and was virtually cut off from my body. I could label my emotions mentally but was never actually FEELING those emotions. Meditating allowed me to start feeling safe in my body for the first time in probably 20 years. It also helped me to become more deeply connected to myself, life and other people. My relationships have been so fulfilling and nourishing as a result.

•	I realised how long I had been living in a state of survival and how much of that resulted from childhood trauma. Instead of running from it, I began to deal with the experiences I had growing up and the reality of what that had meant for me. I could then make different choices that truly supported me instead of doing things that kept inducing anxiety and stress.

•	Accepting the reality for things as they are instead of how I wanted them to be was important. The longer I denied my own reality, the worse I continued to feel. Trying to hold on to the stories of what I wanted was far more painful than being honest about how they actually are.

•	Drugs & alcohol had been a way to feel good and confident in the moment but always intensified the anxiety and panic attacks. When I began to calm my Nervous System and stopped living in survival mode 24/7, I felt connected and content within which naturally meant I didn’t feel an urge to do those things.

•	Caffeine helped me to deal with my lack of energy that resulted from never sleeping but it was always perpetuating the problem. The more I had, the more anxious I felt and the more often I had panic attacks. Learning how to put my self-care and needs first meant that I could finally do things for myself that I really needed to heal instead of quick fixes.

•	Anxiety still presents in my life but it is natural, healthy anxiety that comes and goes depending on what’s happening in my life. It is no longer debilitating anxiety and for that reason, I can learn from what it is telling me. I now have a healthy relationship with Anxiety rather than being terrified of it.

•	I have learned to always trust my intuition and gut feeling even though it feels incredibly scary at times to go against the story or conditioned thought.",mentalhealth,Constant-Fondant5454,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/13we8j3/i_spent_years_dealing_with_panic_attacks_and/,33,70.65217391304347,5.65217391304347,0.00015077996387590428

I apologize if this isn’t the place to post this. I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was literally 8 years old (I’m 24 now). After getting on meds and regularly going to therapy for the past 4 years my mental health has somewhat improved but even on my best mental health days I still feel like I’m going through the motions and there’s no real point to existing.

When she told me this we were laughing because I told her something funny and then she revealed this I stopped laughing and told her: I think this is horrible, honestly.
She changed the subject and focus in other things we have to treat.
Should I do something or maybe stop going? I could report her for this I mean it's illegal but I don't want to of course she doesn't deserve that at all, so what do you guys think? Should I do something or not?

I hate myself because I gained weight,69,0.92,2023-12-23 01:13:15,"My (25f) entire life, I was 120-130lbs at 5’7. I’ve always been on the skinnier side. I never had a problem with my body image until I started gaining weight. 

I am now 187lbs. The largest I have ever been. I have red stretch marks on my boobs, my thighs, the back of my legs, my fucking lady bits. It’s embarrassing. 

I hate that I’m like this, but I hate myself now. I don’t want to see family because I know they will talk about it. I don’t want to see my husband’s family because they’ll talk about it. I’m scared to go to the store because I feel like all anyone sees is my weight. I haven’t taken photos of myself in a long time. I used to stream, but quit because I couldn’t be on camera. 

I can’t stress this enough, I hate myself. I hate the way I look. I stopped having sex with my husband because of my weight gain. I’ve tried to lose weight but I physically can’t right now. I am always hungry and so tired. I think there may be something wrong with me because of how much I sleep. I sleep 13 hours a day. Doesn’t matter what time I go to bed, I will wake up at 1pm every day. 

None of my clothes fit me. I have to wear my husbands clothes. I recently bought sweatpants because that’s the only thing I’m comfortable in. 

I don’t know why I hate myself so much because of this. I have never thought badly about people who are overweight. I have never treated anyone differently for being overweight. I truly do not care if someone is overweight. But for some reason, I am disgusted with myself. 

I’m scared I will never be my old self again. It’s so hard to ignore the feeling that I’m hungry. I have a hard time exercising because my shins hurt and I get tired so, so fast. 

The worst part is that this just happened one day. Literally. Last year in October, it just happened. I started getting hungry and I began to feel insanely tired. I can’t go through my day without laying down to rest or nap. 

Lately, the need to eat hasn’t been as bad. But it doesn’t matter, I just gain weight like crazy. 

I’ve stopped brushing my teeth and showering. I hardly wash my laundry. I don’t have energy and I am tired all the time.

Why am I being mean to my boyfriend?,61,0.76,2023-11-07 14:58:36,"My (25F) has a stomach bug, and since then I started being very mean to him. I already knew I had problems with these kind of things, it’s happened in the past with another boyfriend.

It’s like when someone (mostly a boyfriend) is sick with some virus, fever, etc I can’t stand the situation. I start being anxious, panicking and it makes me uncomfortable, and I project these feeling onto that person, being mean, irritable and mistreating him. This usually doesn’t happen if it’s some other type of illness  (like it doesn’t happen with a simple headache or something more serious). I’m also emetophobic.

We’re in a long distance relationship and I stopped replying to his messages for hours, I told him I didn’t want to hear from him, and when he told me he had a stomachache I replied in a very cold way. This obviously led to a big argument where I kept being petty. He just wanted support. My only point was to humiliate him, mock him and make him sad and suffering, even after the argument. I’m hating him. I’m freaking out.

I told him I’m not really myself right now but haven’t told him why. He understands. It would make me uncomfortable and vulnerable just talking about this with him. I know this isn’t right and I’m really ashamed of myself. I really love him and I feel sorry for him, for the fact that he’s sick and that he has to deal with someone like me. I usually am normal and really kind and loving. But I also have this part of me I can’t suppress. 

I just want to say I’m not like this, usually I’m a good and empathic person. But I know there’s something wrong with me. I have other types of behaviours that make me think that. I feel so bad. Apart from this episode, no one would suspect this because I cover it quite well. It’s like I’m two people in one.

A video game community made me depressed for over two years,61,0.91,2024-03-06 23:11:34,"

I wish this never happened to me, not even on my worst enemy.

When I was 15, I used to love a game called Sky, a game categorized as one of the nicest and most accepting communities out there on the internet, and people don’t usually get bad experiences there; but I did, and it was horrible. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to share the name because I was scared of more bullying, or people saying that I’m making this up, for not liking their community. That’s how stressed I was. 

I mainly played it for its musical mechanics, their piano. I used to play it so much that it was just the only thing that made me feel alive. Over time, I encountered many issues in the game so I wanted to rant about it in the community, not in a rude way. Issues with the game mechanics, and other things, like not wanting to be recorded without my consent when I play music. (It made many people there angry for some reason) I also tried proposing ideas to the developers of that game, to tweak a few things so that it’s easier for me to play, they said they’ll get back to that, but never did. 

But because to those certain people in that community, it was a ridiculous thing to be stressed over. So they ridiculed me, and called me names, and said some of the worst shit you can think of, because that’s what the internet does; a massive cesspool, a place where you can anything you want, and not get consequences. A few remaining people still tried to help but were mostly puzzled, but didn’t get why I was so upset over the issue. I wish I knew that before I posted. I didn’t realize at the time that this interaction would truly put a dent in me. 

That was over 3 years ago. For a long time I wanted them to apologize for what they did. To apologize that they hurt me, so much that not even words can even describe my hurt. 

Then I realized; no one cares, I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself, that no one actually cares. I’ve never felt so lonely, so isolated, dejected; it seemed as if no one else had my issues, which made me feel even more lonely, I then get angry and then I cry, and the cycle repeats. It wasnt fair; everyone else gets to be content with their games, while I get traumatized. I remember feeling hopeless for a long time. I wanted to disappear. I probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway, poof, gone in the wind, literally. Haha…….

I’m 18 now. I’m recovering, but recovery has been tough. I’m getting by day by day. I’m slowly accepting that some people are just assholes. And I just gotta move on, despite how painful it was for me. I’m choosing to do other better things in life for me. Hobbies like math, music (other instruments not related to sky), or art. It won’t resolve whatever happened but it suppresses my thoughts for a few hours, like alcohol but without the effects of being drunk. I cannot ever go to the past, and change what happened, what happened truly traumatized me, and I don’t think it’ll ever go away. 

I remember posting about this in this subreddit three years ago. it made me feel bad that no one replied, but wasn’t sure why it was like that.

Daughter has Precocious Puberty,59,0.96,2023-12-01 19:14:01,"Daughter has Precocious Puberty

My 8 year old daughter was diagnosed with precocious puberty. 

She was showing signs of puberty since she was 7 (last year)…Also, physical symptoms such as slight body odor, hair in armpits etc.)

Endocrinologist at Childrens Hospital says if we choose not to take hormone blockers or implant, she’ll most likely get her period before the age of 10.

Since I am a dad and a man, I have no idea what my daughter may be going through right now, emotionally and physcially.

I want what’s best for her yet at the same time I can’t speak for her.  My daughter says she desperately doesn’t want her period but at the same time she says she’s afraid of shots.

My wife is open minded and leaning towards getting her shots, but like me, she’s nervous about the outcome and side effects for our daughter.


Any parent that’s dealt with this before? Whether you took hormone blockers growing up or your child has precocious puberty?

I left work on Wednesday to go to his apartment in another city but my other friend convinced me to call the cops.  Apart of me is glad I didn’t go but another part wish’s I was I there.  God this so hard.  Thursday I had to leave work early cause I wasn’t able to stop crying.  Yesterday I woke up feeling that cement was poured into my body during the night and it made it so hard to move.  Half way through the day I had trouble breathing and went to ER.  Everything was physical fine.  I have tried to watch sad movies to cry so hard that I would no more tears and that did work.  I tried looking at pictures of him but that didn’t help.  We also had a year long podcast so I started to listen to it again and that hasn’t helped either.  Today I woke up feeling extremely heavy.  I don’t enjoy anything right now.  I just can’t stop crying.  I work Monday to Friday so this weekend I am really trying to find a way so I can go yo work and stay there from 8-4:30.  I can’t take take PTO cause I am in my 90 day probation period and although my boss and a coworker has been extremely supportive I need to be able to go and stay at work for awhile.  The family is going to hold a private ceremony so I am not invited.  Our friend group is going to hold a memorial of such in July but god I don’t know what to do.  My friend was deeply depressed a couple of years ago in Austin and I was able to notice early and went to him and made sure he was ok.  But this time I couldn’t save him.  Not this time.

There's no one I am comfortable sharing these emotions that even I, feel alienated from myself if thats even possible. 

I am ashamed of what I have become and I dont know how to tell my 10 year old self that no, it didnt get any better, it was just the beginning of my end. I was a good student, exemplary even, despite all the abuse Ive been through but as all stories of burnout go, I am now here in my undergraduate studies not able to graduate after seven years. I feel jealous of my peers who are now soaring in their careers while I'm here rotting in my bed typing this out of pity of myself.

It's not like I have completely given up on myself - I strive hard to make myself better, every single day. I work two jobs after my classes so I can eat at least once a day and fund my studies. But you know what, it just feels like I've been dealt with bad cards at the beginning making me destined to lose in life. Would I have been better if my father did not physically and emotionally hurt me? If I dont feel betrayed and abandoned by mother? If I actually have the resources to fund my interests and hone my craft? 

The worse part is I am actually quite vocal about not being mentally well. But it always feels like it's being downplayed into a joke. Or did I set myself up as a person not to be taken seriously? Idk. Is it the romanticization of depression among my peers that makes me want to burrow all these feelings to myself? Maybe. 

I don't know what to do anymore. The idea of dying  often dwells in my mind, in fact it hasn't left my mind since the time it has sprung in it. It has buried its roots deep in the crevices of my tiny brain.  I might do it and I think I can. But I dont want to for the sake of people I care for. I dread the day that I would be brave enough to do it for myself and not for others.

"My life crashed down around me, how can I rebuild after deep trauma?",59,1.0,2023-08-20 01:10:31,"Hey everyone, I am hoping that by coming here I can find some insight into how to pull myself out of this rut I found myself in.  
  
As a back story, I was married, I have three kids, I was the executive director of a non profit in a big city, I had a large social circle, friends and things to do, and I was quite happy and content with my life. I wasn't wealthy, but I was happy and thats all the monetary gain I needed. Fast forward to 5 years ago, my spouse grew bored and started doing some off the wall things like spending days or weeks away from the home with me having to figure out how to work and take care of the kids. Eventually I found out she was dating another man and asked her to work to resolve it with me or leave. She chose to leave.  
  
I held onto the non profit for a year before finally giving it up, but my mental health has been horrid with no little improvement over the last four years. I have been in 5 relationships in that time, all failed and I blame myself. I am not mentally capable of facilitating a romantic relationship in a healthy way, so I realized I need to just step back and work on myself which is why I'm here.  
  
I have a regular job now, I work a 9-5 which is nice because there is structure. I am not longer disciplined enough to run my own schedule. Perhaps there is just no motivation. I have almost no social circle and for some reason blame my looks. I may not be the prettiest man, but people liked me back then   
I don't understand why they'd have a problem with me now. I go to work and struggle to carry a conversation. I often find myself trying to escape the conversation while at the same time craving the interaction. It's weird. I want to have friends, I want to talk to people, but a friend will call and I avoid the call, I don't pick up.   
  
I forced myself to go to karaoke last night at a local bar and invited some of my friends. Every single one declined. So I sat there by myself wondering what was wrong with me.  
  
I don't believe in myself at all and I think that is the core of the issue. I see myself as a failure. I think people are judging my ugly face and don't want to be friends with me. I feel like a loser. I feel completely alone. I don't get out much because I have my three kids (7, 13, and 14 yo) full time. I want to rekindle my friendships with my old friends but I reach out and they don't seem interested or they don't message me back at all. I want to try and make new friends, but the thought of creating something new terrifies me.   
  
I want to return to the social creature I used to be. I want to be able to carry a conversation and build a deep relationship with ANYONE, even just one person, but I can't. I'm crippled by fear. I get up and leave when someone comes into the break room and it's just us two. I live in this nightmare that I Want to be close to someone, but can't.  
  
How do I rebuild confidence? How can I once again believe in myself? Has anyone experienced this, what can I do?  
  
TLDR:  
My life fell apart when my wife left me and my kids four years ago, and my social life and self confidence have been in shambles and I'm trying to rebuild but don't know where to start and am asking for help from this community to help me get back on my feet and be able to at least carry a conversation without feeling like I'm not worth someone else's time.

"Found out from my new therapist, that my old therapist who abandoned me said she won’t ever work with me again, despite telling me in our final session “that the door was open down the road” for it",59,0.91,2023-07-22 17:11:51,"Last time I updated on this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/14kn5hu/really_struggling_again_after_another_therapy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

My new therapist had me sign an ROI because she wanted to coordinate care with her and find out the whole picture of the termination.

Firstly I found out that my therapist made the decision to terminate me, and subsequent decision to withdraw being willing to ever work with me again, because her supervisors told her she had to (to “protect her license”, which makes it sound like she/the supervisors are throwing me and my well-being under the bus to cover their ass professionally.)

But yeah that’s what my old therapist told my new one when they spoke on the phone.


That was honestly the last thing I was hanging on for. I have no hope. This was the last straw, I’ve been abandoned so many times by so many people that I’ve been close to. My old therapist used to say that “she was the exception” as proof that not literally everyone would hurt and abandon me, but now there’s literally none. There’s never been one exception, not one person in my life, who ended up not abandoning me.

I don’t know what to do. I’m in shock. I was already in shock and disbelief that this was all happening to begin with.

But I had a scrap of hope that this wound could be healed if I got a chance to work with her again and resolve it with her.

The new therapist is okay, but not nearly as understanding or just doesn’t intuitively “get me” the way the old one did.

I have no hope anymore. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I can’t take this.

"Parents forced me to wear diapers and only one set of clothes for school year, now my life is a mess, how do I fix and get past?",56,0.98,2023-06-20 10:34:58,"For context. I was adopted and my foster parents were brand new to parenting. They eventually adopted me. I was very rebellious but also suffering from super traumatic early childhood events, such as getting sexually assaulted and raped by previous foster parents that were men, sexually assaulted by step siblings and mother. Fast forward to 8th grade, I was hitting puberty, and very rebellious. My adoptive parents decided to ""teach me a lesson"" and took away all clothes, underwear, shoes, door off hinges, any sort of privacy whatsoever. I had to shower with cold showers because I was ungrateful"" aka water heater was turned off when I went to take a shower. My parents then gave me a ragged set of Vans, a Karate shirt that I had received from a previous Karate class that year, one pair of underwear, one pair of socks, and one set of shorts. I had to have this set of clothes for the entire year to PROVE that I was grateful to get back my privileges as they said. So no lying, no cheating in school, no ducking around personal questions, etc. I feel like this life event set off a massive traumatic event. I was bullied relentlessly for wearing the same clothes day in and day out, appearing in yearbook photos, activities, sports, etc with the same outfit. I was asked if I stunk like shit because I wore the same thing, if I asked to wear the same thing, if I was only allowed to have one set of clothes. It made me ashamed. I started becoming anorexic, bulimic, staying in the bathroom during lunch and recess, purging after meals at home. Became depressed (I was diagnosed with depression after this event whereas before I never had depression, I was a very happy kid.) I didn't want it getting out that the people who took me in were treating me like this but I was convinced I deserved it because I was such a bad rebellious kid.

This life event has led all the way to now. I can't be photographed wearing the same thing. I can't wear any article more than one day in a row. I have spent thousands of dollars on clothes, perfumes, colognes, shoes, socks, underwear, you name it clothing wise or accessory wise for a male, I've had it it every color, pattern, etc. Some days I have multiple outfit changes because I have the creeping feeling that I've worn it before and it either gets thrown away or pushed into the closet to wear a different day. I hundreds of perfumes and colognes, lotions, anything to make ""the smell"". It's a phantom feeling or smell I get wear I think that I smell really bad and have to cover it up. I will stop whatever I am doing, and excuse myself to put on lotion, cologne, body spray, perfume. Anything because its been drilled into my head that I think someone will comment on my appearance and I want to be prepared.

Was what my parents did abuse? Or were they just being normal parents? When I talk to people about this situation, they chalk it up to them being new parents. Even my parents continually tell me I'm being dramatic and my version of events was nothing like what really happened. They said they got the idea from a church friend.

Another reason why I wear multiple sets of underwear per day is because my parents forced me to wear diapers during high school and threatened to tell my school, and class. They let my teachers know that I was wearing diapers if anyone asked. I was a bedwetter due to being raped and abused and my parents had no idea I was SA'ed. So they kept telling me I was lazy and that I didn't want to go to the bathroom. 

I can't seem to work past these events. I still have hundreds and hundreds of clothes, perfumes, colognes, anything to mask. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos of minimalism and minimalist clothing and it gives me panic attacks to think of someone else wearing the same thing or something that has one shade (one man wears same black shirt, black jeans or blue jeans) it's the ONLY thing he says he has in his closet. His videos pop up and I usually have a meltdown because it freaks me out when I least expect it. 

How do I work past this? I am talking to a therapist but haven't brought this situation to light. Thanks for listening.",mentalhealth,babysloot69,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/14e7jd2/parents_forced_me_to_wear_diapers_and_only_one/,26,57.142857142857146,1.142857142857146,0.00012194950924468743
The mental health support system in the US is just kind of awful.,56,0.98,2023-06-08 03:07:44,"Like, I get it that you don't want me to kill myself, but you could probably handle it just a bit better. I don't understand why they have it organized in the way that they do. I have to hide everything in my head from everybody just so I'm not thrown into a hospital and locked up like a prisoner, all the while having to worry about constant therapy and possible assault. You can't and really shouldn't force therapy on anyone, yet they do it anyways. None of these thoughts are organized because I just got fed-up with bottling my emotions so I'm not treated like a maniac, and I'm sorry about it. I just wish I could talk to someone without being locked away and forced into therapy, but I know that I'll inevitably get thrown into one. I'm going to a counselor soon, and I'm going to try and be entirely honest with her. With all the suicidal and self-harming thoughts that I've had, I'll be going to a psych ward in no time.

&#x200B;

Like it just feels so backwards. ""Oh, you're traumatized and feel alone? Let's throw you into what is essentially a prison and treat you like a borderline insane, unhuman freak. All the while, other potentially dangerous people can do anything and likely get away unpunished."" I may be overexaggerating, but Imo it's just disgusting and stupid. I don't feel like it fixes anything, but of course since I've never been to one I don't really know. Can anyone who's been to one tell me their experience, and if it helped. Those in other countries, tell me what your psych wards are like too, I'm curious if those are similar to ours, or better/worse.

&#x200B;

Overall I'm just scared. I'm going to get locked away and treated like a danger for like weeks and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm doomed to wander the halls of a facility sooner or later. It's either that or I hide everything from everyone and become lost in myself even more. Either way something awful and traumatizing is going to happen, both of them equally horrible.

"(THROWAWAY) I like watching gore, and it's a problem. (15M)",55,0.91,2024-02-13 17:47:00,"Alright, I'm a recently turned 15 year old and I've been enjoying gore content for a good couple of months.

I am genuinely starting to lose my empathy as a whole, to friends, to family, the last time I felt bad for somebody was watching fucking the lord of the flies movie (the one from 1990) at the scene where piggy broke his glasses. That was months ago, now I just hate everyone around me, for every single little thing they do. How they speak, Them complaining, I'm just getting tired of everybody, and it's not like that was a common thing for me to do, I'm quite extroverted and it's basically a 180 flip in personality, I started watching gore out of curiosity, I never looked at the popular ""infamous"" stuff but I did see a few of them, like Gary Plauche, Ronnie McNutt but that was basically it until more recently where I saw the definite most infamous ones like funkytown, split faced diver. A few days I looked back on them and I realise, I'm not doing this from my curiosity anymore, I genuinely enjoy this shit and I can't see the people in the videos as real people, I just can't feel empathy for them. The genres of gore I watch have definetly expanded, I used to have a bit of a mental block for compound fractures and stuff showing bones and self harm, that stuff just irked me for some reason, but I'm completely fine with that stuff now.

Since I became 15 (a day ago at most) I decided to just try and drop it because I know it's obviously fucked up and I am becoming a bit of a mess. However I don't really know if I'm facing withdrawl.

My boyfriend (38M) feels guilty every time we are intimate. He feels like I (32F) am too young for him.,54,0.94,2023-11-19 22:59:56,"My boyfriend and I haven't been together long, only a month. He's been struggling to keep an erection when we are physically together and often loses it if things progress to sex, which we haven't had btw. He has shared that medically it's not a problem, because he has masturbated alone to orgasm.

He told me that he's never dated anything younger than him, only his age and older, and has difficulty wrapping his head around sleeping with a ""younger"" woman.
After a recent heart to heart I learned that he was molested as a child by two different men, one was a religious leader, and the other was an older neighbor. So maybe being with someone younger than him puts him back into this raw state of vulnerability that he has yet to unravel and heal. I brought up therapy and he shut it down right away. And I get it, this is uncomfortable to sit with.

He says he desires me and is so attracted to me, but once the guilt hits, he just can't seem to turn it off and he loses his boner. He said it feels like a lump in his throat that he can't swallow or take out. He has focused so much on my pleasure but now it's starting to get to me where I can't give in return. I want him to feel good, too!

I want to be intimate with him and support him but I don't know how. I haven't pushed sex, in fact I had insecurities thinking maybe he wasn't attracted enough to me or my body. I'm scared he won't get over our age gap and that i'll be single again really soon.

My therapist told me he is disappointed in me,53,0.98,2023-10-05 23:15:41,"Hi, 
I see my therapist once a week.
Last week when I spoke to him, we talked about how my dad is pressuring me to meet this one woman who posted on Facebook that she is looking for additional friends for her friends group. They like to speak English and so do I (I am from the Czech republic so not a native speaker) so my dad figured it would be perfect to meet them and share our interests. Well, he kept pressuring me, telling me that I will never find friends if I continue living like this etc. I genuinely thought I could meet her but after he kept bringing it up every 15 minutes and giving me monologues on how I don't talk to anyone etc, I became less and less interested in meeting her. 

I told my therapist all that and he said it's okay not to put pressure on myself with this kind of thing. Then I told him that honestly I got used to the idea that I might be alone for some time before I go to college and finish my current school (business school), which is 3 more years. 

He told me I shouldn't think that way and I said that I didn't mean that I am not gonna talk to anyone. I just know that if I try I am gonna fail because that's how it happened every time so far. We joked around about some stuff for a while. But then he got serious out of nowhere and told me ""well, I am disappointed in you. Now you know what it feels like when someone is actually disappointed in you."" And it literally hurt so much, it came out of nowhere. I don't know what he meant by the second sentence since the issues we usually talk about (even earlier that session) are that my family sees me as less than them and everyone is disappointed in me. 

I am so anxious to go see him tomorrow. Should I bring up how I felt last session? I cried on my way home and I think about it every day. I saw him as the only person who gets me and has my back but hearing him say he was disappointed in me literally broke my heart. 

I ended up going to meet with the girl the same day I had the session (after the session), there were more people coming in. She didn't know what I looked like so as soon as I got into the café where we were supposed to meet I got extremely anxious, I ordered a lemonade and sat at a different table. I ended up crying, paid and left and got a panic attack on my way home. I think I only did it to ""prove him wrong"" in my head haha which is stupid. But I was thinking maybe by saying that he wanted to push me in the right direction. Well it didn't end well. I don't know if I should tell him all that or not.",mentalhealth,_baby_blue_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/170wmcq/my_therapist_told_me_he_is_disappointed_in_me/,23,54.08163265306123,1.0816326530612272,0.0001154164998208649

[M32] I'm quitting porn consumption.,53,0.95,2023-11-28 19:56:18,"TL;DR: I've decided to stop consuming porn in all forms. My reasons are non-religuous, non-political and I think they're well-thought based on my experience. I'm currently in the process of deleting everything and closing down all accounts/users. 

Basically that's it. I'm currently in a healthy 5-year relationship with my SO. I've been consuming porn (all kind) for a handful of years and I think I've had enough. My SO knowns I/I've watch/ed porn of all kind and is totally cool with it. We even comment on dudes/girls irl that we encounter.

A few weeks ago I willingly deleted beyond recovery my 1,5TB collection of porn material,, which had been harvested over the years. I thought it would feel like a liberation but it just went as ""meh, alright, delete that shit"". Even the days after, my concern was if my horny-self would deeply regret that decision, but not.
I currently still have my Pornhub and Chaturbate accounts up, as well as the email used exclusively for this kind of stuff and some other websites which I need to track down. These are my next targets for the upcoming days.

My reasons for it? A couple:
1. IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME. Man, I could go edging for like 1h every day. It felt good, but afterwards the blame and guilt for investing so much time were disgusting. I know I can edge without visuals for as long as I want, but the video shit is addictive.

2. I started to kinda ""need"" the visuals to get aroused/horny. Sometimes I even surfed TW in order to get those 30s of stimulus prior to having sex. Not good.

3. I was supporting an industry (doesn't matter if pro or amateur/homemade) with dark interests (prostitution, money for sex, e.g.) I also knew this while surfing but my horny-self was clearly in charge and that issues became totally secondary.

4. The past half year, while consuming porn I started to feel it as an addiction. I wasn't thinking the whole day about porn and wanking, but on the way back home I would definitely think about which user I would watch, where I would wank, etc. instead of using that time to do sth. productive.

5. I've seen increasingly more dudes that also took this step and everything where good words.

6. I have my own imagination, and that's beyond reality. And I sort of lost that ability. Every time I wanked and tried to just imagine a situation and it just wouldn't work.

My childhood bestfriend is suicidal and shows creepy redflags,52,0.96,2023-10-28 18:17:57,"/!\\ trigger warning : Rape, Suicide /!\\

Hello, sorry for the long post. I'll try to be brief, but I have a lot of infos. I'll give a bit of context first and then say some redflags things he said to me.

**Context** : My friend (19M) has been in a depressive state for about 3 or 4 years now, and is going in a downward spiral. He feels terribly outcasted in Uni. He says that he hates ""normies"" because they to social event and that he will never be like them. He's saying that everyone hates him and his disgusted by him, or that he's a degenerate. He deleted all his social networks 1 year ago. I tried to hang out with him a few times now, and I thought that it was going better over this summer, but since the beginning of the school year he's been having suicidal thoughts again.

The other day he told me something like :

>""This guy asked if I went to the big party uni was organising, and when I said no, he looked a me with a mix of hate and disgust. I fucking hate him I want to kill him.""

He also told me that he thinks a lot about r\*pe, but not in a sexual way. More like an advanced kind of violence. He told me one day that he wanted to r\*pe a girl he hated, not for the pleasure, just to hurt her. (Or to hire a guy to rape her for the same results). He also said that for the past few weeks, the only thing that would give meaning to his life would be to become a terrorist, just that he doesn't know who to aim yet. He told me that he was interested into going to the shooting range in hit city to pass time, which is something oddly new.I'm sorry if it sound fake or laughable. I don't know if he's serious or just wants to be edgy/provocative. When I asked if he was serious about killing people he said ""I would if I could, but most serial killers had social skills to lure their victims"" and that he wasn't motivated enough.

I don't know what to do. I already told him to see a psychologist multiple time, but he doesn't want to. I tried to give him advices, but I feel like this is doing more harm than good. I also tried to do hang out with him, but it's really hard to motivate him, and we don't have that much time anymore with school. I hope he's not really dangerous, but I don't want to find out that he hurt himself/others and that I could have avoided that.

tl:dr : My friend has suicidal thoughts and wants to harm people (?), I don't know what to do

Why am I so different from everyone else?,52,0.91,2023-08-18 04:27:49,"I (21F) feel like there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm not normal. I know there is no such thing as ""normal"" and that we're all different...but hear me out. I am a college graduate (I actually graduated when I was 19). I see other girls my age going out, having fun, going to parties, traveling the world, etc. all while I'm just here existing. I don't feel jealous or like I'm missing out, I just have no desire to do any of that. Instead of shopping with friends, I prefer shopping alone. And instead of shopping for clothes to go to wear to parties, I prefer shopping for cozy pajama sets and things to clean and organize my home with. On the weekend, instead of hanging out with friends or going out, I complete a long list of chores and tasks. When I don't finish my list, I feel worthless and hate myself. After coming home from work, it's the same routine every day: change into pajamas, relax a little, make dinner, have a shower, relax more, then I'm usually in bed before 10 but don't go to sleep until 12ish. If my schedule is disrupted, I feel agitated.  

It's like I'm an old lady trapped in a 21-year-old's body. I'm not afraid of making friends or going out, it just doesn't interest me. Crowds and social situations make me feel overstimulated, irritated, and uncomfortable, and I don't really see why they're necessary in the first place. It’s not that I can’t socialize, I’m actually very very good at it. I  just don’t like doing it; it’s outside of my comfort zone. The smallest things irritate me beyond belief. I hate 90% of the people I meet and hate going out - I actually have a Vit. D deficiency. I'm much happier in places familiar to me but I'm happiest while at home with my blinds shut, away from the outside world. Maybe I'm just a stupid, lazy complainer, I don't know. I've thought maybe I'm on the autism spectrum, but I don't know that either. Or maybe I'm just really, super depressed. I have depression and anxiety and I honestly feel like my life itself is depressing and repetitive but I'm not necessarily unhappy with it. I'm just feeling mentally and physically depleted and I wish my interests were more ""normal."" All I do is exist. I have no substance. 

My mom thinks I’m just still young and figuring things out and just need to build more confidence but this seems like more than that. 

Sorry if this makes no sense but at least I got it off my chest (kind of).

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not claiming to be on the autism spectrum, it's just something that's come across my mind as a possibility. I was an odd child and I'm now an odd adult, but that doesn't mean that I'm automatically autistic. Just like how the fact that I like to organize and make lists doesn't automatically mean I have OCD. It just means I'm different, there doesn't have to be an official medical diagnosis. If I did want to receive an official diagnosis, of course, I'd go to a professional, not the internet. I did 8 years of CBT and EMDR as well as 2-3 years of OT and never felt it was beneficial. As some of you have pointed out/speculated, I am highly intelligent and mature for my age. I graduated from high school at 16 and from a 4-year university at 19. I will be graduating with a master's degree later this year at 21. I never really struggled academically but found it difficult to make friends and feel accepted, even though I had friends (I become more anti-social and introverted when I started undergrad), I still felt like an outcast.

It's comforting to hear that there are several of you similar to me.

Boyfriend is running away from life itself :(,53,0.88,2024-01-22 14:14:37,"My boyfriend and I haven’t been together too long, and 100% moved in together too early. I am 24 and he just turned 30. I know everyone’s going to say the same thing everyone in my life says, which is that I deserve better. For one moment I need some people to not tell me that and instead understand that I love this man with everything in me. I have never looked at another person and felt.. idk.. safe? 

That being said, he turned 30 a couple of weeks ago and has been struggling a lot the past few months mentally. He has chrons so he’s sick a lot, even though we try and follow a vegan diet to help. He misses a lot of work due to it and then in turn feels like shit. He is new to the area so does not have many friends but me. I’ve tried to push him out to meet new people or get us out with couples to help. 

Nowww for the hard part… last Monday we signed a lease together to finally get us some more space and pay less rent (we’ve both been really stressed financially). That night we got into a tiff and the next morning he quit his job, called his mom, and moved home. Outside of me being heartbroken, I am so worried about him :(( i feel like he’s just running away from everything because of his depression. His mom is very loving, but also in my opinion, isn’t really helping. She doesn’t even have food he can eat in the house normally and does not work herself. I can tell my boyfriend wants to get out of this cycle, but I don’t know how to help anymore :( I’m constantly listening to podcasts and reading books to get myself out of my own depressions. As a child his dad left, and after trying to meet up with him a few years ago and he didn’t show, he’s given up. He was cheated on by a fiancé in 2019. He’s just an anxious sensitive guy who wants nothing but peace, but almost seems to think he doesn’t deserve it? When I said to stop pushing me away, his response was that he has to. That it is best for him to be alone, but it’s never best to be alone.

I hate being a mom,52,0.88,2023-12-08 20:36:49,"As the title states. I hate being a mom. I got pregnant when i was 15 and had my son when i was 16. I have struggled with mental health all my life. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder when i was 8 years old. I have tried multiple medications and been to multiple therapist but nothing has really helped my mental health. When i was 13 i started to over sexualize myself. I would wear low cut shirts, send nudes and started having sex when i was 14. That led to me getting pregnant when i was 15. My parents wouldn’t let me get an abortion or give up my son for adoption. The father was not involved and i was left to raise my son alone until i was 18 he took me to court and sued me which i am now 30 grand in debt over. My son goes to his dads every other weekend but that’s it. When I gave birth to my son i experienced really bad postpartum depression. I think i got over it but some days i’m not sure. Either way i have no bound with my son. No connection he’s just a responsibility. Now i take really good care of my son for my age. He goes regularly to the dentist and doctors. Has new clothes, shoes toys the works. Eats healthy meals and i try to give him as much love as i can like taking him out to the movies, doing fun things like the elf on the shelf but i don’t feel anything. I feel like i’m just masking all my emotions and going thru the motions. Lately all i feel like i do is yell at my son because he wastes food, won’t pick up, throws tantrums and i feel like it’s because he is feeding off my energy and environment. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I genuinely can’t do this another 14 years.

Edit: A lot of people are suggesting i give my parents custody. That’s just not an option. unfortunately parental cycles are hard to break. My mom was distant and wasn’t there for me most of my life.

I actually took some care of myself????!,50,0.98,2023-12-06 07:01:51,"I actually washed my hair AND brushed my teeth today.
I typically put off any showering activities for as long as I can (until I think my hair looks noticeably greasy I guess) and really didn't want to today even though I kept telling myself to. A friend encouraged me and I ended up washing my hair even though I didn't really feel like it.
I also took time to blow dry my hair when I typically air dry it (I felt like I'd probably be in a better mood with it more dry than wet) and I used hair ointment I've had after.

I even brushed my teeth, which I never do (I know I should more because I'll regret it in the future but I can't typically bring myself to do basic hygiene).

I'm currently debating on if I want to take a bath tomorrow/later (1:54am) to lift my mood more if I can, I really need to bring myself to relax and I heard a bath can typically help with that.

Seasonal depression and all year stress with anxiety (plus school, since I'm a teenager) is really beating me up and I don't talk about it to anyone for the most part, so it's more difficult to handle since nobody really knows. Gotta work my way up to help myself some until I can bring myself to actually share my feelings with anyone I see in person.

I want to start a hobby class once week to get out the house. However, I’m worried that if I start talking to someone, I don’t know how to answer “what do you do for work?”

Due to stigma, lack of societal understanding, and trauma – I’m cautious about mentioning that I don’t work or that I’m working on my health.

I’m worried that people might think or express that mental health is bullshit, that I should “toughen up”, or that I’m a dole bludger. I’m worried that people will avoid getting to know me for fear that my mental illness will burden their life.

I’m stuck on what to say. I guess I could come out with the truth or a half truth, but I’m not comfortable lying. Has anybody had experience with this, what worked well for you? Am I overthinking it?

I feel like a loser. I know this isn’t true and that I’m here due to my illness, but I’m worried about being perceived as such.

"my palm started to feel like plastic, when should i stop washing my hand?",52,0.94,2023-06-08 12:25:40,"last month I developed a habit where I kept on washing my hands using handwash. I just couldn't stop and don't know when my hands should be considered clean and when I should stop washing them. Here are the scenarios where I will rewash my hands using handwash soap:  
  
1- When the water from the sink bounces back onto my palms while washing.  
  
2- When I accidentally touch the sink while washing.  
  
3- I always wash my hands more than twice. I don't know why I don't think washing them once with soap is enough. Is this normal?  
  
4- I wash them more than three or four times after putting my laundry in the washing machine.  
  
5- I wash my hands with soap after using a Dettol wipe to clean my phone before cleaning my laptop. Then I wash my hands with soap again before cleaning my desk.  
  
6- I wash my hands again when I accidentally touch the faucet (tap).  
  
7- I spend alot on cleaning product, my housemate also noticed why i showered for a long time and when the water bill arrived, i dont even know how to explain.  
  
8- i feared washing machine \[touching detergent\] and tumble dryer the most, every time after using it i will wash my hand for more than 15 mins. is this normal, when does it consider as clean.  
  
Sometimes, I don't believe that my hands are clean. It's like I forget when to consider my hands clean. Sometimes, I wash my hands or take a shower for more than an hour. I keep washing my hands after touching anything in the bathroom.  
  
These habits prevent me from doing meaningful things. Sometimes, I don't sleep for days because after cleaning something in my room, I go and wash my hands with soap before cleaning the next thing. It takes so much time that I didn't sleep for two nights. Yesterday, I didn't sleep at all because I was cleaning my phone, debit card, and the sink. These habits also prevent me from cooking my own meals. Sometimes, I only eat bread and biscuits for breakfast and skip dinner and lunch. I have also stopped working out because I'm scared that if I touch the carpet, I'll spread all the germs to my housemates. I have lost a lot of weight because of this, and I wake up with anxiety. Sometimes, the first thing I do when I wake up is wash my hands with soap. My hands are so dry that it's hard for me to fully open them without risking injury. There are razor blade-like cuts on my hands, and now my palms feel like plastic. It doesn't feel normal.  
  
When should I stop washing my hands? When are they considered clean? It's so hard for me to deal with this. I have used a lot of patience, and I want to stop this as I spend more time in front of the sink than on my screen. I can't do anything productive in my life. Sometimes, I also stop hanging out with my friends because of this issue, and my friends ask me why I suddenly disappeared, and I have to come up with fake excuses.

Why are EVERYONE so fake and awful nowadays? I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore.,56,0.94,2024-02-18 11:57:01,"Let me explain. I’m a 22 year old female, and I’ve learned so much recently. My entire life I’ve been very naive, and assumed everyone had good intentions. I have adhd, and I speak my mind, and thought most people did that too. I met a lot of men (and women later) who treated me very badly, and I would always ignore it and blame myself. I had a job working only with females, and I’ve never been close to fake people (that I knew of), so a lot of bad situations happened. They would talk badly about me behind my back, excluding me, making fun of me, using me as a target. Looking back I met/attracted those people because I had no boundaries, didn’t speak up, self-blamed and had very low self esteem. People always treated me badly because I let them. I learned a lot about myself and got a lot of self awareness.

My point is, people started telling me I had to understand that most people lie, are fake, and only act from selfishness and that’s just how the average human brain works. I get so disappointed in humanity, if that’s how most of the people in the world acts. Every time I met someone (usually men) I legitimately thought was nice, they would end up being an asshole after a few months. Proving my point every time. I now have to try to distant myself in my mind, from the new people I meet, because they always end up disappointing me. I would attach myself way too quickly to people in the past, legitimately caring for them, and they never gave a shit about me. 

If you think about how much awful shit, humans have been/are capable of doing (war, torture etc), it’s so scary. Are most humans just naturally bad people? Doing those extremely evil acts, and more “normalized” behaviour like abuse, harassment, lying, cheating, manipulation etc. Is the really how the average brain works?

How am I supposed to navigate in a society with liars, manipulators and fake people? It’s very discouraging and sad. It’s not possible that ALL of the people I’ve met coincidentally were the few bad ones. I’ve gone from naive and unknowing, to kind of cynical. «treat people they way you want to be treated” is apparently outdated. If you’re kind and trusting, you’ll get taking advantage of.

How common is to keep living just so you won't hurt those close to you?,49,0.99,2023-10-19 03:24:11,"Hi! I hope this doesn't sound tragic, it is a very honest and sincere conversation. The thing is: ever since I was kid I dicn't quite get the whole point of living as an adult. Having to work 5 days a week and barely enjoying the other two (because we have many obligations beyond work) seems like the same as being a rat in a maze.

Then, I grew up and I just confirmed my childhood perception. Honestly, it is definitely not an experience that is worth it. Not only that, but I see no rational reason to believe that in the future this will be better, specially considering how things are going in the world right now. However, I would not be able to adopt *the drastic solution* because I feel that would be an immense pain to those who love me.

I forced my husband to go to a mental health triage center a few days ago, and after a minute they walked him to the ER because his plan to kill himself was detailed and extensively thought out. He was transferred to the mental health unit. I wasn’t able to see him until the next day. Very strict visiting hours 3:30-4:30. It was like visiting a prison and I felt so guilty for the conditions he had to live in, though it’s necessary. I returned today at 3:30 with a fresh pair of underwear, but apparently they only do visiting hour 3:30-4:30 on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I drove over an hour to get there and I just wanted to give him a hug. I didn’t realize how important it was to me until I lost it, and then I snapped in the car. I screamed and cried harder than I have since my brother died. I want to scream and cry and puke and punch things and I’m so overwhelmed with all my emotions. I am in SO MUCH PAIN. And I don’t care that he’s where he needs to be, it still hurts so fucking much that I feel like the emotional pain I am in might kill me. And since they can’t start PHP until Tuesday they want to keep him even more days. It’s absolutely barbaric for everyone involved that only 3 hours of visitation is allowed per week.

Made my therapist cry today.,49,0.91,2023-05-06 05:24:16,"Trigger warning for mild domestic violence. 

My inclination here is to make some stupid joke about how I won therapy and I'm the therapist now because, that's how I handle tough situations, but that's a different can of worms. There really isn't anything like making a seasoned therapist who's seen it all cry to really put into perspective just how fucked up you are. 

The thing that gets me is that I was just describing my day to day and the mindset I walk through life with. That's my fucking normal. That's the default. That's just my life. And watching her break down and needing to give her a minute really put it into perspective. 

I guess that objectivity is a good thing. One thing that therapy has helped me realize just how much of my mindset was just an assumed normal. That this fucking stormcloud isn't how most people live their lives. I mean we all carry a bag of rocks and if you meet someone that claims to have no baggage they're either lying, not aware of it, or the single most boring human on the planet. But having baggage and normalizing your trauma are not the same thing. 

A good example is that, amoung my other bullshit I was stabbed earlier in life by a partner and my therapist brought it up to explain current behavior patterns and my first thought was ""yeah, but come on. That was years ago..."" A stabbing. My partner coming at me with a fucking knife and here I am putting a time stamp on it like it's expired milk. Like rereading this post I described a fucking stabbing as ""mild"" abuse. I understand that it's a coping mechanism, but jesus christ. I mean she was right though, I was using ""yeah but they didn't stab me"" as an excuse for shitty behavior from current partners. 

I dunno. I guess I just needed to put this stream of consciousness into the world. I just needed to be heard. I needed to make it real by acknowledging that living my life this way is neither normal nor healthy.

Survived Suic Attempt 4 Years Ago. My Scary Experience of What It Was Like,52,1.0,2023-12-14 02:38:38,"\*\*Trigger Warning: My Story Includes Suic Attempt\*\*

&#x200B;

Im coming up on 4 years since surviving a pretty brutal attempt on my life, and wanted to share my story, some hope, a little advice, and reflect on what my life looks like now/WHAT I WOULD'VE MISSED OUT ON.

Jan 6, 2020, id been in a dark place for a longgggg time, and was basically a walking time-b\*\*\* waiting to go off.  My alcohol/drug addiction had reached its peak.  The weight of those consequences was so heavy on me, and knowing the weight my struggle put on ALL my family/friends (specifically a divorce i caused) felt unbearable.

&#x200B;

I was numb and at a point where I was spiritually dead.  I didnt feel happy at happy moments, I had no interest in my fav things, usually things that were sad, I felt nothing.... or at least thats what id thought.  reflecting back, they were very painful moments that i refused to acknowledge, or properly grieve. i self medicated, HEAVILY, and felt it would pass.... it didnt.

&#x200B;

All the negative stuff that I had neglected and used substances to mask, piled up like a log jam, and once it clogged, every new negative piled up farther and farther back. I had dealt with none of it, and it got to a point, where even thinking about trying to deal with a decade of emotions felt insurmountable. Id waited too long, this task couldnt be fixed.

&#x200B;

I was out of town on work, and had went for a walk with no particular purpose, but TICK, TICK, TICK, id been looking for a way out for a while. In an unfamiliar town, I had come to a railroad track right as the gates went down, the flashing red, DING DING DING and the screaming horn of a train coming through.

&#x200B;

At this point I had mastered ignoring consequences, to just do what made sense in the moment, to refuse to look ahead at the consequences of my actions; whether a year, a month, or 5mins ahead... i had conditioned myself to be selfish and only in the moment. Nothing had particularly been wrong that day, but a thought came in--- run in front of the train --- and it ends. I did exactly that.

&#x200B;

Initially after my ""accident"", I didnt remember much, its all a blur, with moments hear and there remembered, especially with time, they started to come back.  Here are some early thoughts/moments I can remember in the following days:

&#x200B;

\-Worst pain imagineable. I have a massive concussion, everything is a 10/10 blur, I think I'll never see again.  Both my arms are broken, I learn Ive already had 2 emergency surgeries

\-My left arm is ""OK"" 12 screws, a few plates, and in a cast. My right arm was a massive compound fracture, with several breaks.... they have it in some type of stabilizing brace, where there are screws into my shoulder, upper forearm, and wrist, my arm floating below it ""suspended""

\-I dont know what state Im in (truck driver), Ive been missing from family 2days with no contact. Im as vulnerable as it gets, and there are no family or familiar faces around. ATROCIOUS (cant stress this enough) feeling

\-Im in a pain med and concussion induced fog/swirl.  I dont remember the beginning of this interaction, but a Doctor is in the room with me.  The attempts to save my right arm have not worked, if I dont agree to an amputation, I will die a pretty miserable death.  Basically, my body has rejected the arm, it is dying, and my liver enzymes are growing exponentially, Im rotting to death lol

\-I DO NOT WANT TO DIE, AT ALL. I dont care how tough, nihilistic, depressed, whatevs you are, I had been in a deep state of all those.... Im not ready to leave, and Im scared of the potential for an after-life

\-I agree to the amputation, but the Doctor gives me lukewarm news... its roughly a 50/50 I pull outta this thing, even if they take the arm.  In a whirlwind of heavy news, this is the heaviest news. Im bawling, and I feel alone, the doctor holds my hand, and at that moment it is the greatest human contact imaginable. Crazy how desperate for human affection I was after years of disconnect

\-I dont remember the start of the interaction, but Im laying down, being wheeled to a room for surgery. Im starring at the drop ceiling as it rolls past, I cant see it clearly, I hear nurses talking, I cant make any of it out, and I think how crazy that THIS is the last moments I get, a pure haze.....

\- Im in a huge (or atleast it seems) surgery room... its crazy bright, it feels like a dozen people are in there, everything is a serious tone, im seeing tables with tools on them, the kind from TV, but this is me, and its real, despite how surreal it all is....... anddddddd now Im counting down backwards from 10 inhaling the sleepy gas through the mask. HOLY FUCK, THIS IS ACTUALLY IT, IM SO DUMB

&#x200B;

\--------------------------- The Big Surgery Complete---------------------

&#x200B;

Im heavily sedated, confused, my moms here though.  She cries, I cry, its amazing im here. Again, all this is incredibly cloudy, its like a film thats been cut in random places, then picks up mid scene, think ""Memento"" hahaha

&#x200B;

Im not out of the woods, we'll have to wait and see how my body responds, Ive had atleast 3 (maybe 4?) surgeries.  The nurses are all so sweet, im so happy to be alive. A few of my regulars saw me come in, had some type of interactions with me, and are so happy Ive pulled through.  I need help with everything, but these nurses dont mind at all. Unable to drink, eat, poop, pee, or do any of the bandages or anything at all. I can feel compassion and tenderness in every interaction... i feel like some sort of strange celeb.

&#x200B;

Within a few days, my brain is much better, I have a rapport with all the different nurses and aids, and Im beaming from my soul.  These ppl DO NOT KNOW ME, and they quickly feel like family.  They take care of my every need, and make me laugh and smile, they bring in food from a local restaurant, and keep me company.  Id been in a cold world for so long.  These strangers showed me all the love and compassion and value that I needed medically, but also emotionally. Somehow they not only physically nursed me back to health, but spiritually as well. Like a light switch, I felt my soul turn back on.

&#x200B;

\--------------Out of Hospital-------------

&#x200B;

In the hospital I realized booze and drugs had slowly extinguished my soul, it was a huge part of it, but there was more.  I immediately got into some Narcotics Anonymous meetings..... the same love Id gotten from the medical staff, I got there almost instantly.  My grim, pessimist attitude towards humans, has been eviscerated by a combination of these two groups of strangers.

I jump into counseling.  Another great move, at first it feels forced, but i stuck with it, eventually build some rapport, and 4years later, hes one of my best friends and my counselor.  We've grinded and knocked down a lot together. Ive learned healthy coping mechanisms. Learned to control impulsivity, especially the destructive kind.  Counseling is a wonderful tool, especially if you have a small or no support group initially.

I got a dog! Man dogs will force some love into your life.

Ive acknowledged all my past mistakes. Ive grieved them. Grieved the loss of my arm, my clean date/acci-versary are at 4years come Jan 6th.

Ive reconnected with family, apologized, been forgiven, and made a point to maintain my mental health/sobriety as a point to not be that guy who has a come to Jesus moment, and as soon as the coast is clear..... hits the pavement looking for destruction.

&#x200B;

Looking back, its crazy to me, that all this was the direct result of a split-second decision (sort of, from oversimplified perspective).  I think about what wouldve happened, had I not done that a lot. While im not 'glad i did it', i also wouldnt trade any of this back for my stupid 2nd arm lol ---im the happiest ive ever been in my life, by far, like sooooooo far.  the saddest part of dying wouldnt have just been dying, it truely wouldve been that i missed out on the chance to be happy. Im at peace, I joke/laugh, cry at commercials, tell my family (and friends- to their annoyance) I love them.

If youre reading this and struggling, please dont harden your heart against this story. Please dont miss out. Realize that - YES THIS CANNNN HAPPEN TO YOU, OR WORSE - only you can fix this.  Find any one thing small you can do, and do the shit out of it.... then add another... have uncomfortable conversations telling family whats going on.  Dont lean into the negativity youre feeling

Im 35 and fairly healthy, Ive adjusted physically, i dont think about the amputation much, it doesnt stop me from doing really anything...... Im blessed. I really couldve/shouldve died. I wont Bible beat anyone, but for those curious, spirituality has been a big part of healing too.",mentalhealth,AmputeeBoy6983,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/18hycxs/survived_suic_attempt_4_years_ago_my_scary/,18,52.0,0.0,0.00011097405341266555

My longest relationship was 2 years and that ended about 8 years ago. I had a 4 month relationship just after, but nothing except being used since 🤷🏻‍♀️

My living situation is awful and I can't afford to get out. My landlord ignores me and the two housemates that live above me are nightmares more often than not.

Trying to get a new job so that I can afford to move out is proving difficult and I'm not crazy about how I'm being treated there either!

I lost my mum 3 and a half years ago and I don't feel like I've dealt with it as well as most people would. It still doesn't feel right.
My dad was diagnosed with COPD earlier this year and doesn't seem to be doing great, so I'll probably have to deal with that soon too and I'm not ready.

I honestly can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy, or even okay! I suffer with depression and anxiety, I've had multiple therapists, including bereavement and I still feel like this 🤷🏻‍♀️ I can't afford private therapy or medication and I feel like I'm out of options.

Does anyone else know they will eventually commit suicide?,49,0.97,2023-06-17 13:39:57,"Hi everyone. I’m a 21 year old male. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for the last 10 years of my life. It all stems from childhood trauma. I’ve been to therapy and a psychiatrist plenty of times. As I’ve grown up I’ve learned to deal with it more and more. Over the last year I dedicated my life to getting better. I got diagnosed with bi Polar depression at the beginning of 2022. I’m on medication for it now and things are going a lot better. I’ve dropped 40lbs over the last 7 months. My mental health has improved, I’m in a great relationship and working a nice and easy job with good income.

My boyfriend is making me feel exhausted.,45,0.93,2024-02-02 19:39:57,"Context for my current life. I moved away from home about 7 months ago now right after graduating high-school to be with my boyfriend (Lets call him J). I had been living with a roommate but after a couple months J had a mental health crisis and I had to move him into our apartment because he said he wouldn't be safe if I wasn't with him everyday. I didn't really feel ready for that yet but I obviously didn't want him to hurt himself so I had him move in despite that.


For context on J, he has BPD and Autism. He's undergone a lot of traumas and mental hardships, I completely understand and accept that he feels differently and often times more strongly than I do, and that it is hard for him to manage himself, but I feel completely worn down trying to take care of him.


J likes to go to music shows and venues, that really helps him fulfill his social needs. I'm more introverted, and those sorts or things are usually pretty draining for me. I've expressed this to J but I always end up going with him anyways. J doesn't drive, so I drive him usually around half an hour to go to these shows. I know J has other friends they could plan to go to these with, but ever since I've moved here I've been the person going with him. This is because J doesn't feel comfortable going places without me.  No matter what I don't really have a choice except to accompany J to these shows, because if I don't they won't bother to go with someone else, and they will have a breakdown later.


When J has a breakdown, I am the one who stays with them and makes sure hes safe. These breakdowns can last hours, and he has yelled, insulted, and pushed me (never enough to make me fall or cause harm) during them. These breakdowns are absolutely exhausting and traumatic for me to deal with, so most of my energy goes into preventing them from happening how ever I can. These breakdowns can be caused by a lot of things, some recent examples being


-The house isn't clean enough

-I don't want to be sexual with J at the moment, even though he wants to be

-J is tired

-J is hungry


There's other reasons Js has breakdowns, many of them are reasonable reasons to be upset, stuff like J feeling like im not properly addressing or handling his health (J has epilepsy,  and there are times I could have better handled situations regarding that.)


To make sure J doesn't have a breakdown I basically always have to be on stand by for him at all times. He mostly asks me to do simply tasks like making food, or going to the corner store to get him something. Nothing that really should take much out of me, but the fact that I have to deal with these things immediately and without negotiation whenever he wants is a little stressful. If J asked me to make him food and I said no, he would feel neglected, and probably not eat, which could lead to a breakdown. I just really wish I had my own time and space where I felt like I could just focus on myself.


J and my roommate don't get along because they dated in the past and had some major problems. J doesn't even want to talk to my roommate, which means I'm usually the one medigating between them. J wants to use the TV but roommate is using it? I have to ask to use it on his behalf. Roommate left a mess in the kitchen? I have to bring it up to roomate. 


I feel selfish but I can feel how tired I am. I'm irritable all the time, and I hurt myself pretty often because it's the only way to manage that. My memory is awful, and I feel like I'm in a haze a lot of the time. I don't eat enough anymore, and large aspects of my life are going neglected because I can't muster the energy to deal with them. I'm fucking losing myself, even writing this I realize how much off and robotic I seem but that's all I can be. I've been wanting to write a post like this for a while and I just didn't have the energy until now, and even now I don't have the energy to sound anything but robotic. I'm trapped in my life and I feel like I'm completely drowning.",mentalhealth,AlienBovine,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ahc8cw/my_boyfriend_is_making_me_feel_exhausted/,44,48.387096774193544,3.3870967741935445,0.00010326369734429176
Life is great. And I want to die.,47,0.97,2023-12-13 14:42:22,"I haven't slept in 36 hours. Cried silently and alone for about half of that time. I'll try to keep it short:

* I am 24F, almost 25, and am Asian, if that helps provide any general cultural context for what's to follow.
* I was diagnosed with major chronic depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, bipolar 2, and ADHD around 21 yrs-old when I finally got health insurance for the first time and sought help. It took that long because my family just never understood what mental health was, let alone seeking professional help/diagnoses, and we went through financial hardships throughout my high school/college years so we wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway.
* Despite being undiagnosed with so many issues and experiencing a wide range of traumas, I grew up relatively well-adjusted, and a star student. I played multiple instruments, I excelled in sports, won medals, graduated high school with a 3.97 GPA, got scholarships into college, and even graduated college at the top of my class as salutatorian in 2021. I have many friends and am part of many social circles.
* My mom, the absolute most loving, supportive, beautiful woman in the world.. was diagnosed with Leukemia in my senior year of college. I'm so thankful she lived long enough to watch me receive my diploma. She died from Leukemia the following year in April 2022. Our entire family was lost without her. I was (and honestly am still) absolutely destroyed by her death. I was her main caretaker for the last few months of her life. I was with her in hospice when she took her last breath.

So here I am. Still grieving. Unemployed since August because I work in the animation industry and I think we all know how *that's* been with the recent strikes.

I don't know. I don't know what to write. I'm just rambling because I'm spiraling. Am I writing a *note?* 

Once I was diagnosed, I did start medications, and kept with them for about the last 2.5 years until my health insurance (provided by my employer) ran out because we were all laid off. I've been off them since August, so if I *did* go through withdrawals, I honestly couldn't tell you because my life has never been stabile enough for me to have a baseline to compare to. I could've been taking sugar pills for all I know, I don't know. Maybe the medications just lessened how extreme the extremes could be, but I know for sure that before, during, and after meds, I have and still always feel depressed, anxious, low energy, low motivation, irritable, self-deprecating, etc, etc. 

But on paper, I'm so successful. To my peers and relatives, I'm a role model. I'm the first descendent born in the US to graduate from college, and as salutatorian. My name can be found in the credits of a very successful TV show. I have an incredible support system through my dad, my brother, my SIL, and my partner. I have a house under my name.

And I want to die. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing brings me any lasting satisfaction. I try to stay social, reach out to friends, go out on dates, and we regularly have family dinners. But everything is just a distracting from the never-ending inner turmoil I'm going through. When I stop moving, when I lay in bed and everything is quiet, all the negatives thoughts come back, and I grieve for my mom. The ""nothing makes me happy"" part has been a thing since high school, well before she died, but it definitely amplified with her passing.

I feel nothing from playing video games and hobbies that I used to love when I was younger. I eat like shit and have become overweight. I feel like a disgusting shell of myself. I hate the way I look in the mirror, and my brain just tells me, ""You let yourself get fat and ugly. You deserve to stay fat and ugly."" even though my family and partner regularly reassure me that I am still beautiful and that my worth isn't tied to my appearance. But I can't help it. I was the ugly kid growing up, then I had a glow up in high school and looked good as hell through college. And then my mom died, so I just stopped taking care of myself. In a similar way, I was a spoiled upperclass kid growing up, then suddenly poor through middle and high school, then back to being very comfortable once the new family business kicked off during my college years, so now I don't even know how to feel about money.

I know I need therapy. I've never had therapy except some crisis counseling I got through my university, but they weren't even licensed therapists yet. They were interns/students still working on their psych degree. I enrolled in obamacare this November, so I should finally have health insurance again starting January 2024, but I don't know if/when I'll find a safe and reliable therapist.

Will I make it to Christmas? Will I make it to New Years? Will I make it to my birthday the following month?

Part of me wants to die, part of me absolutely refuses to put my family through that after having lost Mom, especially to my dad and brother who have shown nothing but love and support for me. Truly, I am so, so, so, lucky.

Which is why I feel even more guilty for feeling this way. Life is so good right now. Our family business is bringing in a comfortable income, and I'm not being rushed or forced to get any menial job that'll likely add to my stress. Everyone gets along and loves one another, and especially love me.

And I still want to die. I've always had it at the back of my mind since middle school. I've never self harmed in ways that would be permanent (cutting, burning, etc), though I did develop an unhealthy coping mechanism of bashing my head/forehead onto walls/tables and digging my nails into my palms.

I'm just.. I don't know. I just sobbed and doomscrolled throughout the night and now it's 9:30 in the morning.

I (19F) think i’m a cocsa victim but i’m not so sure.,49,1.0,2023-09-09 10:46:44,"So a couple of months ago i came across a tiktok of a woman discussing “cocsa” and how it’s rarely talked about. I wasn’t sure what that meant at the moment so i looked into it more and it uncovered a memory I locked away in my head.
When I was 6 or 7 my cousins slept over at our apartment and in the morning we decided to play house with my siblings. My cousin who is a year older than me, so at the time either 7 or 8, took charge and assigned everyone roles in the house. He made my 3 siblings and his 1 brother be the children, and him and i be the “mom and dad”. I remember we had a closet with a decent amount of toys in it so we all ended up playing in there. When our siblings left the closet, he urged me to stay in the closet with him. He said mommy and daddy’s have to kiss because that’s what grown ups do, so we did. I dont remember it lasting more than 30 seconds and that’s stretching it. When I left the closet, we heard spongebob begin to play on the tv in the living room and our siblings went running to sit on the couch and watch tv. I remember exclaiming “ooh spongebob!!” and then turning to walk away, but he grabbed my arm and told me to stay and that he thought spongebob was boring. I said okay and sat down with him on the bed and he started kissing me under the blanket. Somehow my curtain rod fell off the window, I still don’t know how it did but it was never really reliable in the first place. That scared me a lot because I knew what we were doing was wrong so I told him I really wanted to watch spongebob. He told me to do one more thing, even typing this right now is making me sick..he made me perform oral s8x on him, but he said just do one lick. Afterwards he kissed me again (still under the blanket) and my dad came in and pulled the blanket off and he grabbed me. my dad pulled me into my moms room where she was sitting with my aunt folding clothes (his mother) and he said out loud “(my name) was in the room kissing damn (his name)” They both got up fast and my aunt went to get him and talk to him in the other room, and my mom talked to me in her room . She asked me why I did it..and my answer was “because he made me do it”
I can’t remember what happened after that, but my cousins left pretty soon.
This whole situation just bothers me constantly. Like, I KNOW i was a child but why didn’t I just leave the room..why did i let him take control over my mind like that? But why did he do it in the first place and why me? and we were so young, does it even count as abuse? I don’t have a relationship with him nowadays, and even in our older kid ages, i still kept my distance from him. I was 11 when I went to his water park birthday party and I remember just not saying a word to him because I was afraid he remembered what happened back then. We were in the lazy river and he caught up to me and he started to speak but before I could let him get another word in, I submerged myself under the water hoping he would be gone when i came back up but he was still there and asked me “remember when we were little , you were always so happy to see me “ and i gave a nod and floated away. Anyways that kind of went off topic but i’ve been thinking about talking to my mom about it but i have no idea how to bring it up or what to say at all. I feel that one incident opened my curiosity up at a really young age to where I began watching porn at the age of 8. Fortunately my mom caught me and introduced me to a game called Roblox that took my mind off the inappropriate thoughts for a while but i eventually started seeking out inappropriate games on roblox for a while and to my surprise there were many. I won’t get into any more details about my current state but I Am no longer interested in watching porn and i would actually rather consider myself being a prude. I even convinced myself i was asexual for a while but i debunked that pretty quickly, despite not being a virg. I just feel so shitty and weird and disgusting for what happened when we were little and i strongly believe that one moment shaped my sex life. Should i mention it to my mom ?

I have a few self-destructive habits so I know starting with this will be good for me.

As of today, I’ve gone completely cold turkey. I’ve downloaded the ‘I am Sober’ app and given away the 5L I had in my room. 

I know this sounds stupid and I’m embarrassed about how much of a problem this is for me. Given it away was incredibly hard (I bought some today), and I genuinely feel so anxious about it. I also feel this overwhelming sadness.

I struggle with extreme depression and have recently tried to unalive myself. After this incident I have finally realised what a shit show my life is and want to turn it around. 

I am on route to fixing my mental health and addiction but am struggling to start my journey. I have so many people in my circle that smoke and it’s hard for me to say no when offered.

I don’t have the money to spend but I always find myself spending money on weed rather than essential things like food and bills. When being in debt already it’s the worst feeling in the world. 

My parents and partner cannot stand the fact I smoke and to be honest I can’t stand it either. It’s not who I am. 

I’ve been trying to cut down but it’s just not working and I’ve tried cold turkey in the past but always go back. I’ve come to a conclusion that it impacts my mental health negatively and does me no favours. 

I have also gained a lot of weight from binge eating after smoking and I feel disgusting. 

I would love some help as I’m ready to get my life back after so many years of devoting it to something that doesn’t even help me like I thought it did for so long.

I was date raped 17 years ago,45,0.96,2024-01-31 01:36:08,"17 years ago when I was 21, I worked as a shot girl at a nightclub called “Red Squared” in Downtown Detroit. During my shift, my manager (who was a local celebrity in Detroit) wanted to do a shot with me. I believe he roofied me that night ( his girlfriend had a similar experience a week after ). 

I was unable to complete my shift, so his friend took me home. When I woke up that morning, I had no underwear on and a different shirt and could barely remember anything. I did not drink much that night.

I immediately called my parents because I knew something was not right and I was scared. They didn’t really seem to care or help me with the situation. I went to the hospital and it was confirmed that I was raped. 

I filed charges and talked to a detective but ended up not following through with everything. Not sure why, maybe I didn’t have the support back then and I had no self confidence. But looking back, I wish I would have pressed charges. I just blocked everything out of my mind.

At first my parents were worried for me but the doctors kept saying it was anxiety. And I’ve had anxiety attacks and stuff before and this is completely different.

But because the doctors kept saying it and not really doing much my parents believed so too. Even when things are discovered to be wrong they ignore me. Say it’s anxiety and when I am then anxious because they are all saying my issues aren’t real that’s ‘proof’ that it’s all in my head.

The past two weeks tho have been the worst I’ve ever felt. My body seems to be shutting down rapidly. And I have been having extreme breathing difficulties to the point I’ve collapsed 4 times in the past two weeks. But my family won’t take me to the doctors. So I honestly don’t think I have much of a chance of living much longer. My vision is really bad,Im barely able to stay awake and have conversations with anyone,Barely able to move even like turn around on my bed,haven’t been able to eat food and I’ve been hallucinating a lot.

Breaking up fucking sucks,45,0.94,2023-08-28 20:40:43,"We broke up a week ago. I still love her so much but it wasn't working anymore. 

Now I'm stuck yearning for her. The thought of never being able to kiss her again is killing me. Knowing that I'll never hold her or be able to call her mine is tearing me to pieces. 

For a while I thought she was the one. She was it for me. She's the first person who has made me feel like I'm worthy of love and happiness, and I'm so grateful for that, even though that's ultimately what made me realise that we couldn't be together. 

In my past relationships I've stayed despite the relationship making me feel awful. My last one before this caused a SH relapse and I still didn't leave. I didn't think I deserved better. I didn't think I deserved to feel good in a relationship. 

I wish she could've been the one. I know that she's not, but it still feels like part of me is missing without her. 

Part of me wants to go back. This hurts so much it's unbearable. But I know that going back would be more painful in the long run. And as much as it pains me I have to do what's going to be best for me long term. 

It's gonna take me a while to picture my future without her though.

I feel like I've lost everything.,43,1.0,2023-07-04 09:57:37,"I've genuinely lost everything

I have done it.

I have made the mistake of laying all my future plans and goals, all my love and affection, all my dreams, all my hopes, everything I ever wanted to achieve on this one person.

She was the biggest support pillar in my life, despite not doing anything. She didn't need to do anything to be that to me. All I needed, was her to just love me and be happy, just enough so she would stay by my side.

But I failed. This wonderful, amazing person, this person I prioritised over everything, lost feelings for me.

She came into my life so willing to love me, and I funked it up. I made so many bad decisions, so many fucking mistakes.

I tried my hardest to fix things, despite feeling her slip away, feeling her slowly drift apart from me, I kept going. 

I truly thought I could make it work.


It's been 3, maybe 4 months of no contact. I've had to try so hard to not contact her, to not send her heartfelt messages, to not send her voice recordings of how much I love her still, because I know she's happier, and I know that she knows how much she means to me.

She just doesn't want to be with me, and I can barely wrap my head around that thought. 
How? How could I have funked up this badly?

Things weren't perfect but I didn't care, all I wanted was for her to be happy with me, and after 3 years of us being together, of ups and downs, I failed.


She was my everything. Now I don't even feel like moving on is an option, despite being forced to. It feels like I've just been left behind by the person I loved most.

Why should I even try and be happy, and achieve goals. Why should I put myself first, after I funked everything up.


I can't even believe that I can be okay without her.

I'm in so much emotional pain that my chest is genuinely hurting, physically. 


My heart wants to crawl back to her, to keep trying everything to be with her, but my mind knows that it won't ever be enough.

There's nothing I can do to make her love me.
And you would think, that that would give me enough closure to move on. But it's just making me feel helpless, lost, scared. 


I've only been surviving by following some instructions from a person that genuinely cares for me: ""take it day by day.""

But it still hurts so much. Each day feels so fucking hard to go through.

I was so okay, so used to loving more, giving more, sacrificing everything for her. I didn't care about that. All I wanted was her to be happy and love me, even half as much as I loved her.

But I failed.

I felt so responsible for her happiness, I just remember how confident she grew into the relationship, and I truly felt like it was my job to keep her always happy and to protect her from harm. But now, now that she's gone and is happier without me, I feel I've failed beyond belief.

And I appreciate a lot when people try to tell me that, if she was truly the one she would have stayed, she would have helped work things out, but how can I genuinely believe that statement, if I wholeheartedly know that it was my mistakes that slowly drove her away? 
It shouldn't have been her responsibility, she gave me another chance, but unfortunately she herself wasn't able to truly love me even after that.


I'd wish that she just knew how much she truly meant to me, how much I truly fucking love her and how I will never be able to forgive myself for ruining things. 
But I know, that even if she knew, it wouldn't change anything.

Thank you to everyone who replied with helpful suggestions as these all helped very greatly.


Towards the end of 2021 my brother began to develop depression and anxiety, he was 15 years old at the time. In January of 2022 he broke into my fathers gun safe and told us that he was going to take his life. My parents sent him away to a mental facility for 2 months. Ever since then he has he aggressive outbreaks for 2 years and has been sent to mental facility’s multiple times. Now at the start of 2024 he is at a point where he has completely isolated himself in a extra bedroom of our home. Whenever we would try to approach him he would begin to show aggression. When this first started he would come out a few times a day to use the restroom and to eat and drink water, fast forward to now he hasn’t been coming out at all. He has torn up the room, clawed holes in the bed, ripped off parts of the wall and other things of that nature. He hasn’t come out to eat in a little over 24 hours, nor has he coke to get water. As of yesterday the door was open and my mother saw that there was a large puddle on the bed of urine. My mother asked him about it and she saw that he had completely peed himself. He gave her no response when she asked. She cleaned up the bed and sheets but he refused to take a shower or change his clothes (he has not showered, or changed clothes ever since he started isolating himself). Now to today, my mother went to go check on him due to having worries about him not eating and his urine incident from last night. When she went in the room he was sitting on the edge of the bed shivering and just staring into the distance (keep in mind he has no phone so we don’t know what he is doing in there all day every day). Later she came back into the room to find him standing up with urine rolling down his leg and standing in a puddle of piss. That brings us to now, we don’t know how to get him somewhere (because it is obvious he needs help). He isn’t a harm to himself or others so the police can’t help and we know for sure he will not get in the car to go anywhere.

Everyone preaches forgiveness as an important part of healing but I can't seem to understand that,44,0.98,2024-01-11 14:19:13,"Alot of ppl told that in order to properly heal I have to forgive and move on.

I genuinely don't get why you should forgive the ppl that did you so wrong. Can you not heal without that? 

How am I supposed to forgive my dad for SA'ing me throughout my childhood and to this day? How am I supposed to forgive my mom and siblings for being bullies and casting me out just cause I speak up and call them out? Just because I chose to study far away from them but keep contact just cause they are ""family"" when in reality it's just cause i don't want ppl to say shit about how I ""abandoned"" my own blood? How am I supposed to forgive them when they bring me down delibretaly when I fail at smth?

How am I supposed to forgive my so called friends for bulling me and saying mean shit to me and abandoning me when I needed them most even if I always tried to disregard their actions time and time again just cause I thought they will change?

my dad died. everything is worse,41,0.99,2024-01-08 20:25:18,"i think this might be my first post to this group.. hey i guess..

my stepdad passed away a couple days ago. i don’t know what to do with myself. what to do, how to feel. i’m no stranger to losing people but this. this one. i just can’t. i just saw him the day before. we were gonna clean something up the next day. we made plans. he just didn’t make it through the night. 
he was a marine. served 30 years. was honorably discharged, so he left and met my mom. they married, he moved it. i was maybe 4 or 5. i knew this man my whole life. the man i wish was my biological father. but that’s neither here or there. he’s my dad. period. 
the thing that’s weighing on my so much i can’t breathe is how much he confided in me. told me secrets he swore himself he’d never tell anyone. after each talk i felt like i walked away with 200 extra pounds on my shoulders. 
he was a functioning alcoholic. wasn’t one of those angry drunks. 
i found his diaries. seeing what he wrote. his decline, what he was going through. his anxiety and ptsd. he was suffering alone. he didn’t. have to. that damn stubborn man i swear. 
i went on a 4 day trip with my fiancé. i came back and saw him. he looked normal. but he didn’t come out of his room the whole day. 
i went in there and he was a mess. couldn’t control his bowels. shaking uncontrollably. said he was cold. i gave him my blanket. i’ve seen him like that before. it was usually something i could do to fix it. 
not this time. 
me and my mom cleaned him up. he was shitting blood and throwing it up
the look he gave me before the ambulance door closed. oh my god i’ll never forget it. how soft his eyes were. i’d never seen them like that before. 
our dogs won’t eat now. the house is eerily quiet. the sound of his tv not being on now. i can’t even go downstairs and walk without feeling my legs and knees shake. 
the pressure on my mom now. taking over the bills and we’re seeing we can’t afford anything. even if i chipped in my own money, wouldn’t even come close. 
so ontop of him leaving us we could be homeless

HELP ME : I got groomed and sexually assaulted and I don't know if i want to go to court,41,0.9,2024-02-18 14:33:03,"I (M14) is friend with a really cool guy well name Ethan i met on valorant 9 months ago. Even though we were online friends, we were really close and basically knew everything about each others irl life. Same with others member of the discord we were on. Ethan had a lot of brothers, but the one im gonna talk about in this post is K (M26). There were rumors about K being a pedo, as he had apparently asked for nudes and threatened to rape a girl that was on the server. It started when she was nine, shes now 16. This girl is no longer on the server cause of arguments.  


So, a few days ago, K dmed me, i instantly thought that was weird cuz why would he dm me THE ONLY MINOR and im also ftm so my voice is girly out of all the other online people. We werent close at all, only talked each other 2 or 3 times. Third message he sent already had sexual connotations, and we kept talking, he was always talking about sex and how people love ""femboys"" like me. I texted Ethan about it, and he go angry at me, saying I had to stop seeing him as a pedo as there were no proofs what the girl, lets call her Eli, said was true. He said this was a normal conversation we could have add cuz we like to do sex jokes. He convinced me, and I felt bad for seing him as a pred, so i kept talking to him like i normally would with anyone.   


The next day, after once again a conversation filled with sex ""jokes"" he asked my insta cuz he wanted to say something private to me. I did, turn out the private thing was that he wanted to jerk off to my ""femboy ass"". Thats when it got fucked up, he started asking for pic and sex calls, threatening me and my family when I refused. He then threatened me even more with these pictures.  


I felt like shit, and didnt know what to do, so I went and did the only thing i could do, I talked to Eli. If this happened to her, she would understand how i felt. I hadnt talked to her for months, and she shared that K was still asking her for things and talking to her. She told me to block him, that he wouldnt do anything since he would be the one in trouble. As stupid as this sounds, this really helped me. I blocked him everywhere, and went to talk to ethan about his brother. He believed me, said he was sorry for not taking me seriously, and banned K from the server so i didnt have to leave. Him and another friend talked to K and Ethan's mom.   


Fast forward to now. K's mom wants to talk about this to their therapist, and talk to me tonight, which i  will gladly do since i feel really bad for this poor woman. The other is telling me I should go and file a complaint, and I agree. (He did this to atleast three other girls without counting eli and I).

How I went from living in hell from a brain injury to healing and living in heaven. ❤️,42,0.98,2024-01-23 15:42:28,"My life was absolute hell after I suffered a brain injury from deep sea diving, I can’t even explain the tournament I lived every day. I was diagnosed with countless serious mental illnesses, I didn’t know that kind of pain existed here on earth.

I have lived in hell. I planned my end and went to do it. I was moments away from doing it. Then I had a thought about my dear mother grieving me ending my own life, it stopped me in my tracks.

I decided to dedicate my life getting better. That was 10 years ago. If I ended it that day, I wouldn’t have experienced the best 10 years of my life. Since that day I have married my dream wife, had a beautiful baby boy, followed my wildest childhood dreams to make ocean documentaries and made and starred in a Disney series, bought my first home, travelled the world, made beautiful friendships and most importantly of all I am now stronger mentally and physically than I have ever been, and it’s all thanks to going through the hell of what I went through mentally after my brain injury.

There’s no way you have tried everything because there are limitless possibilities of ways you can get better. Keep trying! You have the strength of thousands of years of your ancestors. Visualise getting better. This storm is here to make you a warrior. All the most beautiful and powerful people on this earth have been through hell.

How did I do it? Focus on your health 110%. Move your body, exercise, eat clean unprocessed food, get sunlight, nature, dogs :), friendships, have a clear goal and purpose to work towards and have a plan of how you’ll reach that goal, watch inspirational people, limit screen time, push yourself outside your comfort zone daily, follow your passions, research scientifically proven supplements that can help mental health, each of these improvements will get you a little stronger each day and before you know it you will look back with pride that you have weathered a hellish storm and came out the other side as a warrior who can take on anything.

Desperate Help. My younger sister (16F) is ruining her life slowly.,38,0.89,2024-01-03 07:45:43,"Just for some background. I am a 20yo young man and live with my parents go to school and work a job, my Father is a hard worker that is working countless nights trucking for the family but usually isnt around due to his working. My mother raises the other 4 children in my family on her own and works at a daycare on the weekends. Our family was never wealthy but we always had just enough to get buy.

&#x200B;

Now as for my sister lets just call her Jessica, she has always been an anti-social type, she never really had many friends, and she spends most her days in her room drawing. Aside from that, she would eat with the family and didnt cause problems.

This past year however, Jessica has gotten progressively worse; nowadays she completely neglects herself and her surroundings, does not ever interact with family, she does not eat any food except for barbecue chips and coke and says every other food is dirty, she will barely sleep, she even developed something in her mind that everything is dirty and will spend hours in the bathroom trying to ""clean"" something even if it was never dirty to begin with.

She refuses to sleep on her bed because its ""dirty"", she refuses to even open a door without having a napkin covering the handle. Whenever, shes confronted by Mom or Dad for this she just has an emotional breakdown and never changes her ways.

I feel horrible for my mother, she deals with her problems everyday Jessica has made her cry because my mother just doesnt know what to do with her as it seems like it gets worse for Jessica by the day.

&#x200B;

Our family does not understand her problem, we desperately need help/information on how we can fix this and get Jessica back to living a life that is not miserable and self-harming to herself.

Maybe it’s just the extreme depression.

Took adderall and don’t know what to do,39,0.91,2023-10-31 23:34:14,"Hello,

So I recently had an exam I was not ready for at all - did not study due to personal issue but the day before the exam at about 9pm. I got some adderall from a friend and took it (it says 30 on it so I’m guessing 30mg)

I have trouble focusing and staying productive - always end up really distracted or incapable of retaining anything i study but Jesus I took that pill and by 2am I had memorized and understood every concept I needed for the exam. 

I studied the anatomy of the ear, and about 5 chapters worth of work, which usually would have taken me weeks.

I’ve taken it again today

I scored a 98 on the exam and I’m trying to convince myself to not take it again because of everything I’ve read about it, but why? Why should I not? I’ve never felt more alive. My friends say I look better, I’m speaking more fluently/confidently. I feel more confident, I drive better, I see more, I feel like I’ve been looking at the world and it’s so dull but not anymore, i finally want to leave my room, talk to people, look at the goddamn grass and smell some dogshit while I walk in the park. I feel f*cking powerful.

I don’t feel the need to eat so much to make myself feel better, I feel in control of my actions.

I’m Indian, I can’t see a psychiatrist because my family doesn’t believe or understand the whole aspect of mental health.

Is it pathetic that I still have mental breakdowns at age 25?,42,0.87,2023-09-28 19:21:56,"I’ve always had mental breakdowns, I figured maybe I’ll grow out of them one day but it doesn’t seem to be the case. 

I feel pathetic because my parents witness me having them. Which mainly is me just crying uncontrollably and trying to stay away from others/hide it, but I’m not good at hiding crying. 

I want to hide it because everyone always asks “can I do anything to help” which the last thing I want when this is happening is any sort of attention. I cannot think rationally when I’m in this state, so verbalizing my needs doesn’t work, I just shut everybody out because I’m not thinking straight. 

And yes I’ve been in therapy most of my life, but haven’t needed it in a year or so. I don’t think therapy will help in this situation as I’ve tried it before and didn’t help long term and hardly short term. 

I know what I need and it’s to cry it out, crying is my bodies way of releasing stress (and humans in general but most don’t let themselves cry which sounds awful). But regardless it makes me feel down in the dumps as I’m crying, but after I often feel relief. I guess I just have to live with it.

I’ve been told by my brother growing up that my crying is “pathetic” so I think I internalized that opinion of his and now believe everyone views crying as pathetic. I just hate to be a bother to others.

Lately everything started to become much worse, money became more tight, family members being sick and can't do anything about it, a very very toxic work environment, lots of bad news and worst of all : extremely disturbing nightmares, from the moment my mother passed away ( she was a single parent and she was my corner stone and pillar of support) i knew that my worst fear is reliving that moment in sleep, and for two years things were going fine regarding this fear, thats was until recently, i started to have nightmares about resuscitating relatives or even peoples i don't know, and every fucking damn time i fail, to the point even in the nightmare when i dail the emergency services i will ALWAYS press the wrong numbers and waste time by doing that  multiple times, I'm unable to sleep well and it was affecting my daily life, but now it is much much worse, i just woke up from a nightmare were i failed to save TWO people in the span of 3 hours sleep, glad my brother was calling and i woke up, therapy is expensive and i had to stop it due to tight money, i really really need sleeping medication but I'm afraid if i asked outright for it i will be treated as drug seeking person, and it doesn't help me at all that i work at Critical area where we do codes all the time, but i really enjoy working there and i can't trade it for anything. 
I just hate that every time i have this situation i will be out of commission, i told my best friend that i will visit her today in the hospital since her father is hospitalized and she is with him ( same where i work) but now i don't have enough energy to spare and feel like the asshole for not being there for her when she needs me the most.

I just don’t want to be sad anymore,43,1.0,2023-06-04 11:13:13,"One day I woke up and took a look at my life and I realized how much I hated it. One random day I just stopped being happy, at first I had so many passions and interests. I wanted to have a career and loved learning about it and learning in general. I’m 15 and for about 3 months now I’ve lost my passion in anything and everything I care about, I dropped a whole 1k on a fucking guitar and I can’t even bring myself to practice it. And then there’s art which I’ve devoted myself to for a whole year and I still draw worse then the girl I liked in 4th grade. I’ve started taking sleeping pills so I don’t have to lay awake at night thinking anymore. At first I didn’t need them but now I can’t sleep without them. One night I decided not to take one and I had the worst realization in my life. I laid awake sobbing for 30 minutes at least holding my pillow out of loneliness. I just wanted anyone to love me, to talk to. I was so desperate for anything. My life’s on a downward spiral, I’ve given up on school from a straight A student to barely passing and all my hobbies i once had are now gone along with any passion for them. I wasn’t worried about killing myself because I’m too much of a coward but lately it’s begun to look a lot closer then I thought. I’ll randomly have depressive episodes throughout the day which bums everyone out around me and stops whatever I was doing while I rant or moan about some mild inconvenience. I’m so tired of life already and it hasn’t even begun. I doubt I could live another year let alone 40. Is there anyway I can make it stop?

I recently found out I'm not ok.,43,0.98,2024-04-03 12:53:30,"*I'm not sure if that's the right flair. This is more of a vent*

I don’t remember much of anything from 0-8 years old.
During that time, my parents filed for bankruptcy, my mom worked nights, my dad got let go and no one was hiring, we had 6 people living in a >2 bedroom apartment/house (we kept moving). 

I went to cbt therapy for 2 years for my OCD. This year I started talking therapy. I was telling him about my life and how I was always considered the golden child, and he asked me ""why?"". ""Because I was a good child? I did my school work without complaining, I never spoke unless spoken to,, I went to bed right after dinner...""
He interrupted ""why?"". ""Because that is what good kids do, and I'm a good kid?"" He asked ""why did you want to be a good kid?"". ""Because bad kids get in trouble, and I'm not a bad kid."" He asked ""what happened when you got in trouble?"". I froze, this conversation had seemed pointless to me but I suddenly felt like I couldn't speak, my eyes started watering, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. ""Nothing"" I said, ""then why are you shaking?"" He replied. ""I don't know"".. ""did he hit you? Did your father hit you if you got your homework wrong, if you didn't go to bed after dinner, if you spoke to much? Is that why?"" ""I don't know. He didn't hit me. I dont remember him hitting me, only yelling quietly."" ""he didn't? ""I don't know""

After that we talked about things I didn't know I didn't want to talk about. 

The week after we talked about phobias. ""What are you afraid of?"". I didn't even need to think. ""Buzzing big ass bugs, the dark, and not being able to speak."". ""Why?"", ""because my sister trapped me in the wasp infested pantry and turned off the light. I was too scared to scream. My eyes were pouring alligator tears but I was too scared to breath."" ""Oh."" He said. ""Did she do anything else to you?"". I had to think, but the more I remembered the less good I felt. My sister had bit, choked, kicked, hit me, cut my hair.. ""one time we were playing pizzeria and I was the pizza. She took my mom's fabric cutter that looks like a pizza cutter and ran it over my bad. My favorite purple shirt was stained that day. (I joked). I thought it was a silly story. He asked, ""you cared more about a shirt than your body?""...""you don't understand, it was my favorite shirt.""

Next session we talked about whatever I wanted.

He asked me what the scares on my arms were from.  ""I don't self harm if that's what your getting at. I work in a kitchen, you get burned in a kitchen."" ""What's that one from"" (pointing at the biggest one) ""it was a cooked to order item and I was afraid I was going to drop it so I put my hand underneath. All the hot grease was dripping onto my arm."" ""Did it hurt?"" ""Of course it did its 400° grease straight off the grill."" ""Couldn't you have used a plate?"" ""I could've but it would had taken extra time to grab a plate plus then I'd have a dirty plate."" He said ""a dirty plate is worth more than your body, you care more about a purple shirt than your body. Why don't you care?"".. ""it was my favorite shirt, and I think the scares look cool."" ""Why do you like being hurt? You're harming yourself and lying saying your not.""

ive never had a christmas that i just experience so little excitement about. its horrible. christmas day has never felt so empty. such a lack of joy. my mom could tell i was bothered and told me to go take my antidepressants. it just makes me feel even more so that im just a burden. no one wants to be around me unless im medicated.  
  
that may have come out of nowhere but i struggled with thoughts like that even before my dad passed away. for a number of reasons, some known and some not, i have felt unlovable, unloved, and unworthy for a couple years now. ive gone to therapy both before and after this summer. and now that the only person who i feel like would ever actually love me unconditionally is now gone. i feel like i have no one who really cares about me. much less anyone who loves me or enjoys my company. maybe this is selfish but on christmas day the only person who reached out to me at all was my ex who i am no contact with right now. the only person that might even pretend to care is her.  
and i even get doubts now that my dad was even proud of me, or loved me as much as my other siblings. i know logically that he really did love me but i'll have meltdowns where all i can feel like is a failure and disappointment and worthless to everyone, including my dad. i cried over an internet stranger saying ""your dad is proud of you"" who was consoling someone else who had lost their dad. i have no idea why i think he isnt proud of me. i've noticed i have problems where i feel like i have to earn my love.

Like when you have an overly controlling person, someone having an episode, etc.

All are results of mental instability. But people won't hesitate to write ""*boo, parents didn't hug you enough as a child?*"" and other hurtful things.

Proof that it's getting worse: ""Karen"" jokes and videos are very popular and Karens are hated. But being a Karen is just a result of growing up with overly contolling parents.

It's like people are all supportive of mental health **until you start showing symptoms**. Then they ostracize and devalue you.

But I don't really understand why they determine someone's worth so much, if you don't have good grades your future is basically f*cked, even though something as vague as the future is incredibly undetermined in itself.
You could have great talents in art, music, sports, whatever, but if it's not studying it doesn't matter.
I usually prefer to go the more fun way, if there were two projects I could chose from, chances are I'm taking the more entertaining one, even if it pulls my grades down.

My teacher made a self harm joke.,65,0.83,2024-04-04 02:31:03,"I made another post a few minutes ago but here's another one. This one is a rant with no real purpose.

My teacher made a self harm joke. Of course she didn't know that I self harm but I don't think that justifies it at all. Let's call her Mrs. Marina because that's almost her name. English class. We're doing work at tables of about four people. Mrs. Marina sat down to speak with me personally about my assignment. I needed help with it but it turned into a conversation between me, her and the two other students at my table. She had some scrapes on her arm and then held her arm up and told us that she had been scrabbed by some tree branches and that we shouldn't worry because she's ""not some little emo boy who..."" and then gestured in a wrist-cutting type motion. It was an awful thing to hear from a teacher I had actually liked. But seeing the other two boys laugh I had to force a laugh of my own. Hearing something I struggle with be referred to in such a degrading, belittling way by somebody who is supposed to be protective and caring or whatever was just weird. It really rubbed me wrong but I couldn't really voice those thoughts to my friends or another teacher afterwards because then they might assume I self harm, which I do. It all just seemed fucked up to me and it bothers me that she got away with it because I didn't say anything.

Disgusted by my own boyfriend,38,0.87,2024-04-02 04:32:16,"Hi, I found out two days ago that my boyfriend is addicted to porn. I found his secret reddit profile online and saw that he posted his genitals, chatted with several girls, sent them videos of him coming, commented extremely disgusting things (in my opinion at least). He is now doing it a year behind my back. I wouldn't say our sex life was dead, I had just gone through a lot the last months so I wasn't feeling it that much. But it was never dead. I moved to a different continent with him, so I don't have anywhere else to go. I am deeply hurt, insecure about my body, depressed and shocked. I don't know what to do, I never loved someone more than him. He never hurt me ever before. But this is too much. I am so grossed out when I look at him and thinking about his disgusting thoughts make me so angry. He now commited to doing therapy, but I don't believe that he will ever stop having the urge to get attention from other women. I am about to book a flight back home, but change is scary. Help..

My partner microcheated on me,38,0.72,2024-02-10 10:05:25,"My partner (39M) has routinely microcheated on me (40f) - be it through reaching out to a woman on LinkedIn to tell her she was beautiful and ""a rare combination of brains and beauty"" after saying the same to me... after we were ""exclusive"" and I had celebrated holidays with his family or set up Christmas decor at his house and we'd established exclusivity to cam girls to porn to talking to exes and random blasts from the past behind my back or gaslighting me to make me feel guilty for calling out the behavior. We've conceived a child and miscarried and I spent a sum of money on IVF to harvest embryos with him. We just bought a home together. Things have been good for a few months but he'd been looking up an ex without contact every few weeks, saying it meant nothing beyond determining whether he'd been in the right to break up with her.


Upon contemplating moving in, I reached out to the common LinkedIn connection that appeared to have no link to him. This was when she revealed he'd hit on her a year ago after we were exclusive. I had someone monitor his account and he turned out to have been talking to and peering at many other women before and while we were together. I finally admitted the latter part to him after he struggled to apologize tonight. I am struggling with the fact that he's a dismissive avoidant and feels shame but has been good to me (mostly) for a few months until tonight. I am afraid and he is being quite cold and blaming me for investigating more before I commit my life and finances to him. Advice appreciated.

What should I do?

Side note: he claims it was common flattery to get a connection, which I've never had to use. He's angry I had someone look, and he keeps trying to make me feel bad for bringing this up.

First 24 years of my life were miserable and not worth it. Why should I recover?,37,0.92,2024-01-19 15:51:33,"
5 more decades of this crap? Hell nah. I'm so tired. I don't want to experience anything anymore. I don't like waking up, or going to cafes, or playing video games, let alone taking showers, eating, cleaning, cooking. I hate it all. 

I tried so hard to recover. So much. Therapy, meds, meditation, exercise, friends, family, fulfilling career, alternative meds, whatever. Most times when I sought help, it wasn't available.


I just don't see why I should go on when I'm just already so tired. Even if I recover, the first quarter of my life has been hell, and it's been irredeemable. I can't ever imagine enjoying life. Whatever I have, even if I was rich and famous and lived in a huge mansion with everything I could ever want, I'll never forgive this universe for creating me. 

I have no reason to go on. Whatever sadness anyone in my life will face won't really make them as miserable as I am. Oh they'll miss me? They'll be sad?

What are the worst/best things a therapist could do?,40,1.0,2023-12-12 00:21:22,"I am new therapist who has just started to see clients. As someone who has went to therapy before, I have some understanding of what I like/don't like about a therapist.

To anyone who has been in therapy, what are the worst/best things a therapist could do during your session? Okay maybe not THE worst thing that any good professional would never do anyways, but things that rub you the wrong way. For example, when I was in CBT therapy it would bother me when a therapist would jump straight into behavioral work before letting me fully express why things made me upset/anxious. Knowing this, I feel out when the right time is to start behavioral work to ensure they vented out all their frustrations first.

I've likely had an ischematic stroke at the age of 12. I've not been the same since.,38,0.93,2023-05-25 19:23:26,"When I was 12, I remember a day in my life that made me feel like I was dying. I woke up for school, my face felt numb and my arms were very floppy. I managed to get myself to the living room and my mum made me toast and some tea. So I grabbed a fork, dipped it in the tea and put it on my face. I was confused. Why was there no toast in my mouth? Moreover, why can't I control my arm? 

My mum thought I was clowning around and asked me what I'm doing. I tried to say something but my tongue was so numb, all I could make were noises with no words. 

A few minutes went by and my whole body went numb, but that numbeness felt like a burning pain. I couldn't walk at this point. I managed to tell my mum that I can't go to school today. Through my numb tongue, I had to speak slowly. It was difficult but at that point I realised I'm not just sick. I thought I was dying. 

At that point my mum started to panic and called the emergency services. I collapsed on the floor, fading in and out of consciousness. Every second felt like a thousand eternities. I began to believe I made my whole life up. Every second I wanted to die rather than endure this. My body felt like it was in a washing machine. I couldn't lift my arms or legs. When I was conscious, I'd scream for hours and hours (probably more like minutes). Nothing felt real. 

I don't remember what the paramedics did, my mum said they tested whether my pupils would dialate and constrict. My pupils were dialated and wouldn't respond to light. Though the thing that bothers me most is that while I buried this incident deep in my mind, I asked my mum about this incident 7 years after. 

 I study neuroscience and even before that I was a huge science nerd so when I learnt about the symptoms of a stroke in detail, I immediately got a panic attack, I felt like I was dying once again, I collapsed on the floor crying and screaming once again.  My arms went floppy without that numb feeling, but I felt just as helpless.

When I asked my mum about what happened, she told me they did some tests on me but they accused me of being on drugs. I was 12 and didn't even take a sip of alcohol. Who looks at a 12 year old, unable to speak, unable to move, on the floor, pupils not responding to light and accuses them of doing drugs? 

I just feel... Alone since then. Whenever my body has any sort of medical issue, I begin to hate myself, feel like it's my fault. I feel like nobody would care if I died.

So concerned about my daughter,36,1.0,2024-01-02 23:40:05,"My daughter is 18, a college freshman. She has had some ups and downs over the years, but lately she seems to be in a downward spiral. In 7th grade she had a particularly difficult year, and developed trichotillomania (sp?). I tried to get her help and therapy and it helped a little, at least to the extent that she slowed down and eventually stopped before she got a bad bald spot. Freshman year of HS Covid hit and like most other teens of this era it affected her social life and maturity. She came through and seemed to find her people through singing and theater and her grades improved. She had a pretty decent group of friends, never a best friend though. 
College so far has been a very rough road. She’s far from home, with no friends or acquaintances nearby. She made a group of friends early on in the first semester and they literally dropped her, icing her out of the group entirely while posting on snap all of their get togethers without her (social media 😡). She was very down about it and I had no idea how to help her. 
Now here’s the reason I’m posting. I obviously love my daughter more than anything. But I am concerned that her personality is putting people off. She is very emotionally immature, never wants to talk about anything real, can’t/wont talk about her feelings, never shows interest in others feelings. It’s like she has no emotion at all. She’s also put on a lot of weight (well beyond the freshman 15) and eats nothing but crap, never exercises and stares at her phone all day. You can imagine the eye rolling I get when I try to suggest anything changing in that arena. I know she’s depressed. I asked her if she was and her reaction was a nervous smile and a shrug, very typical of her. 
What can I do to help her?  I suggested therapy and got the smile/shrug again. If she’s not open to it I doubt it will help.

We are doing long distance, and have been together for three years. 

It’s been really rough for him in his own life (family issues that turned monetary) during that time, and this year and last month it’s been at the lowest it feels like. 

He desperately needs a job to finish school, but he hasn’t gotten a single positive response in months and can’t afford to do much besides staying at home. 

I don’t want to seem like I want to “fix” him a) because he is not broken. Broke yes but no broken, and b) because only him can change his life for the better. 

But can I say or do to help him cope with anxiety and depression? And the feeling of defeated and failure?

Men's Mental Health Month,10,0.92,2024-06-08 10:44:24,"https://preview.redd.it/a1nzvd2tjb5d1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d42e896a065c8cac531a7cce83826241cef673

# Howdy!

As some members have pointed out; June is Men's Mental Health Month!  
Yes, it's also pride month this month. And for those who are wondering when the Women's Mental Health Months was, that is in May (may vary per country).  



**Why is discussing Men's Mental Health so important?**    
Mental disorders affect men and women. The prevalence of several mental disorders is lower in men than in women. However, other disorders are diagnosed at comparable rates for men and women or at higher rates for men, like [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#part_2549). Men are also more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm).

Certain symptoms may also be more common in men than women, and the course of illness can be affected by a person’s sex. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.

Men are less likely to have received mental health treatment than women in the past year. Recognizing the signs that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting treatment. The earlier that treatment begins, the more effective it can be.

But mainly, and that is what we have been seeing here on r/mentalhealth a lot: people assume that men don't struggle simply because **they are often portrayed, or expected, to be strong and silent**. This expectation is rooted in toxic masculinity and has resulted in poor mental health outcomes for men.



https://preview.redd.it/ft787mdkqb5d1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=149a484e1ba75ac2136dbdf6c81a3f4b558601d6

A [research](https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/40-of-men-wont-talk-to-anyone-about-their-mental-health#:~:text=77%25%20of%20men%20polled%20have,negative%20stigma%22%20on%20the%20issue) has shown that: 

* **77% of men** polled have suffered with symptoms of common mental health conditions such as anxiety, stress or depression.
* **40% of men have never spoken to anyone about their mental health.**
* **29%** of those say they are ""too embarrassed"" to speak about it, while 20% say there is a ""negative stigma"" on the issue.
* **40% of men** polled said it would take thoughts of suicide or self-harm to compel them to get professional help.  

    
That last one is alarming, this means that the majority of men will not seek professional help when they struggle with suicidal or self harm thoughts! Men don't talk about their issues and often think: 'I’ve learnt to deal with it', 'I don’t wish to be a burden to anyone' or ‘I have no-one to talk to’. We hope r/mentalhealth will offer you a safe place where you anonymously can share your story. While we are on the topic of being anonymous, it is totally okay to create a new Reddit account and post here on that alt account!

77% of men polled said they experienced some level of symptoms for common mental health problems such as anxiety, stress or depression.

But what underlying factors are driving those symptoms? Respondents were asked about the biggest causes of pressure in their life - pressures that might negatively impact their mental health.

The top three issues were:

* Work-related pressure - 32%
* Financial pressures at - 31%
* Health concerns - 23%

Is this something you recognize?

So what is? As with all complex healthcare issues, there is no easy answer when it comes to redressing the disparities in access to formal support for people of color and those from other diverse ethnic backgrounds. Nevertheless, where there is a will, there is a way!    
  
If you are struggling, it would be helpful to visit your local healthcare provider. But doing that can be scary.  
You might feel that they won't listen or are able to understand. Or you might struggling to put into words how you feel. In both cases, this [article](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/tips-for-talking-with-your-health-care-provider), will give you some tips and tools on how to talk to your primary care provider. You deserve to be seen and heard!

r/mentalhealth is a peer to peer support subreddit. Please share in the comments what has helped you!  
This can be a podcast/music/a video/a book/an article or an app (yes we will screen them for promotions).   
Or you are more than welcome to share your story on how you approached getting help IRL. Was it as difficult as you maybe thought. Would you do something different? What was the response you have gotten after asking for help? 

And if you need help, please let us know what you are dealing with. So others can give you some tips on what worked for them. Or maybe they recognize themselves in your story! 

Aside from awareness, we hope this can spark a conversation on the topic. Because conversations and connecting with eachother is what we are all about.

Someone could tell me their dog died last night, and everyone around me would be emotional and “oh my god im so sorry” and in my head I would have zero emotion whatsoever, like it didn’t even matter at all 

This has obviously led to some challenges in life, specifically with my spouse and trying to see others point of views. 

It’s challenging because in arguments I would basically have zero idea “what the big deal is” meanwhile everyone else is saying they can’t believe I don’t understand why someone is upset/sad/etc etc 

For several years now I’ve been told by others I lack empathy, so I’ve tried to find ways to “manually” cope with this problem… for example if someone said their dog died, I would say oh man I’m so sorry…. Even though I personally feel nothing about it, I just know via societal norms it’s just the right thing to say… so I’m basically solving the problem via superficial “emotional intelligence” more so then having any real thought or opinion or feeling on the matter 

Well recently I took one of those Genetic / DNA Tests and low and behold I got an alert saying that quote “I may lack empathy” because of a genetic mutation that actually physically makes it hard for me to chemically / emotionally have a reaction to these matters - so basically the entire things been genetic this entire time 

The problem obviously, is I don’t know any way to “fix” this , other then just trying to keep “faking it” and making sure I use proper language in empathetic situations without actually understanding at a deep level how it feels or what the issue is. 

Has anyone else ever felt or been this way? ",mentalhealth,Astimar,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfch5c/hereditary_lack_of_empathy/,2,3.0,0.0,6.40234923534609e-06

I don't think I'm getting better,5,0.86,2024-06-13 18:10:48,"Hi, I'm turning 20 in November, yet I feel like there really isn't much to life. The idea of graduating with a degree, pursuing a career that I'm passionate about, building a family all seems so mundane to me.

I truly envy others who seemingly know what they're doing and wasting no time, thinking about useless stuff like what I'm doing to work towards their goals. I sound like a lazy person that's complaining about every minute thing right now, but the truth is I probably am. But I like to think that I've put an effort to not feel this way but yet I feel nothing.

I feel disconnected from everyone. Parents speak about trusting God and his plans. Good friends all have sound advice for me to deal with this feeling, however I've never been able to resonate with any of it. I'm truly lost. Perhaps I'm finding an excuse to working hard by feeling this way. Maybe not. Either way I'm feeling it.

I used to blame my parents for my upbringing. It may as well be their fault for me being like this. Eventually I've come to accept that holding it against them solves nothing, so I blame myself. I really see no possible future where I can love existing as  the person that I am. I have no idea who I am anymore. Everyday I have a hundred thoughts for every single thing I want to do. It's exhausting and I don't think I can do it anymore.

I'm scared of the pain of dying. But sometimes I wish I had the balls to do it. This whole life thing is not working out for me no matter what bullshit mindset I'm forcing myself to have. I'm gonna start praying I don't wake up the next day starting from tonight.

Since 2018 I have been in a constant state of agitation, anxiety , depression, stress & I feel like I have some level of adhd or autism. I think about s**cide but I have never selfed harmed/attempted, im too scared too. I think about it more in a questioning my existence way than in a serious way… if that makes sense. Ive built this entire life in my mind that im too scared to live outloud. Anytime im on autopilot random waves of sadness come over me.

Can I become less emotionally numb and more empathetic or is this just my personality?,3,1.0,2024-06-13 20:08:58,"Hi everyone! I’m not sure if this is the right place but I could really use some advice as I’ve been trying to change this for years but feel stuck. I feel like I’ve always had a very dampened emotional experience compared to other people. I’m like the opposite of a sensitive person, I’m pretty indifferent to most things and nothing really bothers me or if they do I can get over it pretty quick. I do feel emotions but most of the time they’re not very strong or they pass very quickly. I’m pretty sure this is because of my worldview - I’m quite ‘existential’ bordering on nihilistic tbh and life feels meaningless. I feel like I’m always searching for ‘more’ from life and would describe living as boring, kind of like “is this it?” In that way I suppose I’m some version of depressed but atypically so. 

Anyway because I’m like this I find it really hard to relate to other people’s experiences which always seem to be quite emotionally charged. E.g. I’ve always found the notion of anxiety to be confusing as I can’t imagine caring about anything enough to be anxious about it. It simply is not that deep (to me). But I don’t like that I’m like this because I can’t effectively support my friends when they share certain experiences. I just can’t get my head around why they care so much.

Igroring or accepting?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 00:35:25,"Hello, let's start by saying that I am a nationalist and there are people that make fun of my country on Instagram and IRL. I was so tired of these people that I started to make an IG account and try to modernize my country's language all by myself. I also took a step further and tried to make an account that makes propaganda videos against the opponent country.

Yet the opponent country is more powerful in this electronic battle of people. When I look at my people, I see they are sad enough to handle them, but I know in the depths of my heart that I cannot do anything by myself for my country, yet I do things that no one will do.

I can't sleep till late hours, something around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., and all I think about is how to free my country from the sh\*t government, make my people happy, and shut down those who hate us. I dream that my country will become modern and powerful enough to play a role in the this century. I also dream about myself becoming an example in the history of the world, a good person that everyone will remember.

Yet dreaming all that looks too far for me.

Sometimes I get so angry that I like to kill someone from the opponent country to satisfy myself, and sometimes I even don't want to go too far and I want to beat those who I hate daily, yet they are in front of me. My love for guns has increased over the last two years. I wear military-specific commando outfits. Everyone finds me strange for doing that, yet I feel like I have a role in all these sh\*t politics.

I have so many more mental problems that I cannot fit into this post, but here is the questions:

How I can Ignore all the opponent country shit that they say about my nation or should I accept it?

How can I get rid of this f\*cked-up situation that I am stuck in, like an Americans who doesn't care what other people say about their country?

Stupid energy and happiness from lifting weights ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 00:34:33,"This will be a pretty soft post.

For sports where the strength of your hand movements and grip are used, lifting is usually done every day with about a single repetition with a weight close to your maximum, since for example, in armwrestling, you will need SINGLE explosive movement from your hand, then this training mimics that, being able to do an explosive force just once

And what does this have to do with mental health? I am someone who is quite anxious and stressed, due to the fact that I overthink a lot but for some reason, these lifts throughout my day give me incredible energy and mental fullness. 

I can be studying or working at home and take a 20-minute break and do a single that will leave me calm and energized.

Why am I indifferent about everything?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 00:04:57,"It's a question I ask myself for the last 5-7 years. Is it bad to not be bothered about anything? I'm 24 now but I feel like I always have felt indifferent about pretty much anything. I like some things, I have hobbies and things I wanna become but I'm not obsessed about anything. I like my hobbies but if for some reason I stopped tomorrow, I would be perfectly fine. All of the people I know have something that they say they cannot live without. It's not the same with me. I may like something but deep down I don't really care about it. It's not the end of the world for me if I can't do it for some reason. 

Also I have never felt emotions that deeply. I've loved someone some years back and I still love them, but I can still live my life without them so I don't mind. Even family members. I love them and I don't want something bad to happen to them, but even if something happens, serious or not, I need to really push myself to remember to care about them. 

Also on the topic of death, I feel totally ok with it. Even when I lost my grandparents, I pushed myself to cry so that others can see that I care. But I wasn't feeling anything. I didn't feel sad, happy, anger. I didn't feel anything.

A lot of times I think that I don't feel that much. Maybe I know how I should feel but in the end of the day I don't care that much. It won't change the universe whatever happens.

I can't help but think I don't deserve love because of my weight , because of my face . 

It's such a horrible and ugly way to think but I cant help it .

I take selfies I look good with filters of course

I blame myself for being like this no one else .

It's all catching up with me,1,1.0,2024-06-13 23:44:29,"I've lurked on reddit for a while but it feels like it's time to post.

I feel like I've had a lot of stuff happen in my first 32 years of life. Bullying from a very early age, numerous close family members passing away, family members with serious health conditions that need support, losing a parent (death) early on, serious health condition myself at 22 (resolved, thankfully),  marriage, divorce, quick career progression and now facing the decline of the 2nd parent and a sibling in my early 30's, and dealing with everything that goes with that.

I feel like some of this is unusual but some isn't, recognise that many people have their own battles to fight, or, just cope with. But lately it's all catching up with me - the demands of my work vs the financial security it brings, my remaining parent and the support required (which I absolutely do not begrudge but healthcare systems make social support practically impossible), trying to just deal with the demands of life and, God forbid, actually make some time for myself and seeing my amazing friends (who are scattered to say the least and busy living their own lives so I definitely don't want to burden them with my stuff...I'm only willing to burden reddit users apparently...) I honestly don't know how people with kids function, you have my eternal respect.

I feel like a decade and a half of hardship is catching up with me and I'm losing it.

Big psychological problems since childhood - I want to find what I have...,1,1.0,2024-06-13 23:14:13,"Hi there!

I'm a French student. This is the first time I'm posting on an English-speaking sub (sorry in advance for my English, by the way). 

To sum up my problem, I feel like my whole being is based on psychological problems, and I still don't know the source of these problems.

I started having a lot of OCD at the age of 11. For reasons I won't go into here, I had horrible school hours (7.30 a.m. - 6.15 p.m.), and when I got home, I'd eat a little and work (homework) until 11 p.m.. 

I've done nothing but work all my life, I think because it was the only thing I felt respected for. In fact, despite all these years of working like crazy, I've always had a lot of trouble concentrating. 

Often when I'm working, I feel pressure in the back of my head, and I get stressed/ intrusive thoughts. When I do something well, I have a little voice in my head telling me ""that's good"" but to put pressure on me and I find it even harder to concentrate.

Today is my 22nd birthday, and I have the feeling that chemically, my brain doesn't want to allow me to be happy. I still have this permanent pressure in my head, this feeling of being limited in what I have to do, and I'd like to know where it comes from, what causes it?

Residential care for 8-year-old with pediatric bipolar?,3,1.0,2024-06-13 17:01:00,"My 8-year-old son has been struggling with mental illness for a couple of years now, and after several psychiatrists, medication regimens, and fruitless therapy sessions, we are looking at residential programs.

Last week he began threatening self-harm, and at that point I began to surrender to the inevitability of hospitalization. 

He's been diagnosed with pediatric bipolar disorder, but as you know, psychiatric diagnoses pre-puberty are dicey. At the very least, I can say that he becomes explosively angry over unpredictable things (i.e. his pajamas are in the wash, his cat doesn't come when called, we're out of bananas). He has also begun sobbing fits over similarly unpredictable matters -- not just fit-pitching, but episodes that look like a grieving child. His last month of the school year was marred by a dozen absences when he simply refused to go -- crawling under his bed crying. When we actually made it to school, he frequently vomited (I'm pretty sure he has learned to throw up at will), and we had no choice but to pick him up. Needless to say, the outlook isn't auspicious.

Emotionally numb ,2,1.0,2024-06-13 18:20:22,"I am now 18 and I’ve had a deeply volatile and traumatic childhood, my dad was cruel to me in my young years and kept introducing new “step mothers” into my life and would expect me and my two younger siblings to cooperate and accept these new family cultures and ways of life immediately every time. 
I won’t go on for too long I hope, but when I was 12 he introduced me to my third step mother (his third relationship since he and my mum divorced when I was 5). 

She was nice at first but I always felt something off about her. She went on to be emotionally abusive, cruel and manipulative for the entirety of their relationship until six months ago, when she up and left out of absolutely nowhere. 

I have experienced a lot of abandonment and abrupt change in my life, when my other step mums left, through various other family conflicts, and this time too - my dad and her have a child together, my sweet youngest brother. She also had two younger children who were my step siblings for 7 years. Her cruel parents also lived with us for the majority of their relationship and they are now gone too. 

I can’t feel emotional about it… I don’t feel any emotional attachment or sentiment to the whole situation. 

I can’t even really process the traumas I went through but all I know is that I feel like I am avoiding even trying. 

I had a lot of physical, emotional and sexual abuse through this time, I also dealt with depression and very high levels of anxiety due to significant traumas I witnessed and experienced, however I  had to always keep my thoughts and feelings hidden to avoid conflict between the family as she was very controlling and I was forbid to speak up.  

Why don’t I feel sad or angry or hurt? I feel nothing, it feels like nothing ever happened. 

I love my brother and her kids so much yet I never get to see them anymore, they left our home one day and never came back. I don’t even know where they live. 

I feel unavailable to everyone and like I don’t want a reason to see her but I really want my siblings to be ok and I feel a responsibility to make sure that happens, as I am the oldest.


Is it normal to feel this empty? Or indifferent? I feel like a crazy person like I don’t know how to regulate a normal emotional response to this and other things going on in my life.

How to find friends ,1,1.0,2024-06-13 21:58:41,"Hello,

I'm quite lonely and I struggle a lot with it.

I currently have no friends and I feel like I can't change that in any way. I think I don't seem very attractive or interesting to people. I can't keep up with the expectations of others.

I'm introverted and have some kind of social anxiety but I think I got better with this. I talk with others at work and in normal situations and its not the extreme issue it ones was.

But my biggest issue remains. When I was around 13 (I'm 25 by now) I basically quit my social life because people became weird and I extremely disliked alcohol and stuff. I had some online friends every now and then but it never really got anywhere in the long run. So I mostly played games and learned stuff like progamming.

Because of that I have quite some deficits when it comes to social Interactions especially in real life. I didn't do anything most people do in their teenage years. I lack a lot of experiences and even knowledge about myself. Like I don't know what kind if partner I would like to have.

A few years ago I tried to catch up but I'm unable to do so. People reject me because I don't meet their standards and expectations. Sadly without others I can't really navigate in real life. I don't know many things people see as common knowledge and when it comes to stuff like partying its even dangerous to go alone as someone like me. I can only imagine how a day out with friends would feel like.

What should I do? I don't seem to be able to make progress.

I start to get quite depressive from time to time. My logical thinking naturally keeps me away from worse conditions. I not used to much emotions anyway so resisting is not that hard. But the pain is still real and I would like a better social life.

I currently work a remote job so that doesn't really help with this.

I also won't fake any interest in stuff like sport that I don't actually have any interest in. I refuse to lie in such a shitty way. I don't need friends that I have to lie to first.

I can’t anymore ,1,1.0,2024-06-13 21:37:14,"I am always the one in the family who has EVER de-escalated an argument. Proof of Thur 13th June (yesterday as of writing) argument is enough as even when I was broken beyond belief I still tried to de-escalate but can’t when I am the focal point of the argument. This is further proof I can never open up my true feelings to either of my family as an argument happens 

Before you say that is a lie or even think of denying it just think who you go to in the house when you’re annoyed, frustrated or dealing with an issue. That’s right me. I am sure you noticed that when I am the focal point of an argument it escalates as without me to de-escalate no “peace occurs”.

Dad you say you want to keep the peace then please learn to de-escalate and not escalate like you always do. Don’t think of denying it as when amber and you argued you wanted to call the police and without me there you would have called the police as you wanted which would have made things worse. 

You dare say I have no empathy when I not only have my emotions and issues weighing on me but yours amber and all my friends. Not even starting to grace the pain and sorrow i went through with mum and as you guessed whenever around mum I was the one de-escalating. 

I am never able to say why I am truly always on my phone and until now I couldn’t give a true reason but deep down I knew why. Well after the recent argument with you I know why as you distract myself from all the dark emotions I have. 

I can never speak to anyone in this house about anything I am thinking of and never plan to as I have too much of a burden that you don’t even realise. Just as I was writing this you came upstairs to “talk” but all it was, was mainly you making it worse with you claiming you were de-escalating a potential future argument with amber and myself but nope you weren’t even if you think you were. To de-escalate you would need a calm face to start but the face you gave then was the complete opposite. You looked at me with a face of disgust and anger nowhere near calm. It is no fault of your own as from what you told me at a young age you weren’t able to learn how to calmly de-escalate an argument.

To give a little insight on my upbringing and current situation, I was raised in a religious household, dragged to church every Sunday morning, night, and most Wednesday nights. Through these experiences I remember a threat that was held over my head throughout childhood. Something along the lines of if I don't do right by the Lord I'm going to hell. This has put me in a position where I don't want anything to do with religion because I feel like no matter what I do I will be judged, but as I've taken time and given myself space away from that subject I don't feel any better. There is still something in the back of my mind that says ""watch out serious platypus, you don't want to end up in hell."" This judgment comes from everywhere whether or not it is actually true is a different story.

I know a lack of self-esteem can be a major cause of this as well as social anxiety which is something that I have been diagnosed with.

These experiences grew, and as I fought through the troubles of childhood, clinging on to writing I eventually came to a point that sent me on a downward spiral...

I remember the day that my passion for letting people read what I have written was stopped dead in it's tracks. As childish as it sounds, there was a girl in school that liked, and she wanted me to write something for her. So I did. After school that day she read what I wrote, and ripped it up in front of me and just dropped it like it was nothing. I feel like my confidence in writing and self esteem in general was crushed at that point, and ever since then (it's been a while) I've been struggling with putting words on paper that I am proud of, or that I feel like won't get torn up in front of my eyes. But here I am reaching out for help.

How do I rekindle my self-esteem and not feel like I am being judged at every corner of my life? And most importantly, how do I reignite the passion that I once had instead of just sitting around and waiting for the end. I know I have just written a lot, but I feel like I am in the bottom of a well trying to climb out with no rope or footholds.

"Girlfriend sleepwalking, tryed to run away at night, what should i do? ",0,0.5,2024-06-13 19:44:27,"My girlfriend f24 told me she is sleepwalking at night sometimes, but i never experienced it before. The relationship is still new and we are on holiday together right now. So i just experienced it for the first time and don't know how to react. 

We were sleeping cuddled together in bed,  i woke up because my arm fell asleep from cuddeling so i tryed to move it. 

That startled her. She jumped up from bed, made loud noises that were not understandable, but she clearly panicked and ran to the door. To note, this all happened in 1-2 seconds, very fast. She was 100% sleeping and not moving at all before this happened. 

I was shocked myself and didn't understand what is going on and how to react at first. I catched her before she left the hotelroom and tryed to calm her down. First she tryed to fight me but she quickly calmed down and fell asleep immidiatly again.

Today i talked with her about this and she can not remember anything but she had a similair thing happen to her in the past, one time she tryed to run to the forest in the middle of the night but her mom catched her before she left the property of their house. 

Can this be a mental condition? How should i handle this?

I didn't expect her to really try to run all of a sudden, if she really leave the hotelroom it will be difficult to find her, espescially when I am asleep when this happens the next time. i think it will also be dangerouse for herself since she don't remember anything, maybe she will run on a busy street or get lost in a foregin country. 

I think she has some other mental problems too, but i still did not confirm them.  One of them is probably an eating disorder since she feels stomach ache every time she eats a little more food. But she eats very little food all the time, it is impossible to feel full with this, she is also very skinny and underweight.

However I am not one of those exceptions instead I am intoxicated with the delusion of unworthiness. I know I’m not prone to failure anymore then the average person is- but I don’t feel like that. I struggle with the idea that I can be normal- have an intimate relationship, have friends and have a skill. I know logically that I can- I’m not prevented in any significant way from having that but despite this I don’t feel normal. It’s strange to me- I have everyone around me I’m doing well, teachers, parents. Yet I feel like they are lying to me, even if I know they are not. 

I tried hobbies guitar, bass, piano, creating adventure maps in video games. Yet I quit- I do enjoy them I really do but then I listen to music or play an actual game, or try to get people to try my game. Then I hate my voice, my dexterity, my ability, my creativity. It’s not terrible but it’s average. I need to accept that because some people don’t have talent and that’s okay. I know it’s okay but I don’t feel okay, I feel useless, pointless, helpless.

How social media has worsened my depression. ,4,1.0,2024-06-13 09:43:43,"Social media has made me feel even more depressed. Since childhood, I have faced rejection, isolation, and humiliation. This pattern continued through puberty and into my adult life, affecting me both socially and professionally. As a result, my mental health has been suffering greatly, and I have often felt incredibly lonely.

I turned to social media hoping to find a sense of acceptance and belonging, thinking it would provide a great opportunity to socialize. However, I noticed that people I interacted with online would unfollow or unfriend me without any apparent reason. This made me realize that I will never be liked or accepted.

Am I normal?,1,0.67,2024-06-13 17:05:35,"I have been feeling a lot of different things for a while and I want an explanation or something to look into but feel clueless.

-I prefer to be alone and often lack energy for social interaction. My relationships are usually strong for a week or two before I ghost people. It’s not that I don’t want to maintain them; I just struggle to do so, and I avoid people to prevent hurting them.
-I feel like I have a hard time talking about how I feel to an extreme
-I CANT CONCENTRATE AT ALL IT SUCKS!
-I kind of have like a phobia of people or social situations
-I don’t have much enjoyment in anything anymore, even things I used to love like video games.
-I’m incredibly anxious about everything and avoid important life events due to fear of embarrassment.
-I have MDD, which likely explains my lack of energy and negative mood. Despite sleeping 8-14 hours, I wake up feeling exhausted and want to sleep again like right after.
-I have problems with memory, I always forget important stuff unless I write stuff down 50 times and screenshot it and make it my wallpaper I won’t remember it. It took me until I was 18 to remember my parent’s birthdays for example. I don’t even know my cousins names even after repetitive reminding.
-I feel awkward talking, I never feel comfortable doing so and I can never get to the point I want to, I feel like I always take a side road that is wayyy longer to get to the point filled with nonsense. 
-My motivation varies greatly, affecting my academic success and daily activities. I can go from motivated to wanting to stay in bed indefinitely very quickly.
-I neglect self-care, such as brushing my teeth, washing my sheets, or cleaning my room, likely due to depression.
-Lately ive felt like there have been bugs in my skin, that’s the best way to describe it. It happens everyday, throughout the day, all day, but its not 100% constant, but I would say its pretty close to constant.
-I feel paranoid, like I’m being watched or that someone is in the room with me, even though I know no one is there. For example I could be on my computer and feel like 100% there is someone behind me about to grab my shoulder even tho logically I know there isn’t but I still have to quickly check to make sure.
-Sometimes, when walking around my house, I feel like someone might jump out at me or attack me, even though I know it’s irrational.

I have lost two close family members, one very young, one very old, over the last one year. I suspect that has made it worse. I have a boyfriend who loves me and I feel tremendous amounts of guilt wanting to die this badly, but I just feel like it needs to be done. I don't feel satisfaction in my work, I don't feel like I have great friendships and even at times when I did I never felt like life was worth living. I keep losing people and with these losses I have lost so much of myself that I cannot recognise myself anymore. I focus on things that shouldn't be focussed on, I'm materialistic to the point of self-hatred.

What is cyber/gangstalking?,1,1.0,2024-06-13 16:41:52,"Context: I am Canadian, and for those of whom are living outside of Canada, we are implementing a rather dubious and cynical practice called “M.A.I.D.”. Medical Assistance In Dying.

A friend of mine who I’ve not spoken to since high school has been dealing with what he calls Gang Stalking or Cyber Stalking. It is essentially the belief that he is living the life of Jim Carey in the movie The Truman Show. The belief that everyone is an actor and all interactions are tests performed by a powerful entity.

He fantasizes of MAID but is currently unable to receive it because it’s not outlined in law that people with this mental illness are eligible for it.
———————————

Question #1 : How should I (or anyone) deal with someone who is exhibiting this illness? 

I have already told him that I am on the side him, the part that is aimed up, so I will not rally for amendments with MAID (I would not rally for it for anyone. No one should have a ‘compassionate killing from the government’).

Question #2 : (context) He is also atheistic, which I also was for 15 years, but I’ve come to learn that reality isn’t only made up of facts and matter, but also how to act in the world. What is the world made of vs how to act in the world. He has done something that strongly goes against the moral order (not murder, but I should not share) which I feel he is having a hard time processing as he does not have and has not had the proper moral framework to deal with the evils of the world and within each person individually, including himself. 

(Question) Does the lack of a moral order outside of one’s self create the environment where you could be subject to an OCD/Bipolar/Schizophrenic state? Due to the fact that it can be absolutely terrifying to realize the evil capacity within one’s self? As opposed to the atheist claim along the lines of ‘we’re all basically good, just be good and everything will be alright’.

This doesn’t make sense to me,1,1.0,2024-06-13 16:20:51,"My former therapist basically described to me that, without meds, me trying to better myself is the equivalent of ‘trying to swim to shore with only one available arm.” Like, as I interpret it, its very VERY difficult to do. Still doable, but barely. He was making it sound like it’s nearly an impossible feat to better myself without meds. 
If this is the case, then why was he still basically pushing the idea of me bettering myself on my own? Like he was telling me to go to IOP and work on myself there. Without meds basically. But didn’t he just tell me that bettering myself without meds is very hard? If so then why are all these professionals downplaying meds so much when someone like me clearly needs them AND therapy (trust me, if you knew me, you’d know I need a boost from meds to be able to better myself. That’s how badly I’m doing with my mental health). 

Maybe he encouraged me to do IOP even without meds because he was able to do it himself. But my problems seem to be more complex than his were before he was able to better himself.

I've got a 5 month old baby, and my mother recently passed away which could be contributing, but Ive been obsessing over guilty thoughts of basically all the bad things I've ever done and feel like  a terrible person. 
The main thing I'm obsessing over which causes me great shame and guilt is from a couple of years ago. In work (while in my current relationship, we have 2 kids together) I became quite infatuated with a colleague who is married. One day he held the lift for me and called me over. I thought nobody was around, and there was definitely some flirtatious body language and eye contact between us. It would have looked like we were about to kiss if someone saw us. It turns out someone did and he used every occasion since to make thinly veiled comments about it and it was clear he was trying to makee feel ashamed and for all I know he thinks we were having some kind of affair. The man involved started receiving these comments too from the other colleague, and became very hostile towards me and then moved to another team. I feel so dreadful and idiotic about the whole thing and I feel like I've gotten mysef a reputation as some sort of dangerous homewrecker, though I have no evidence anyone has been gossiping about it. I wish I could go back and change my interaction with him that day. I've never cheated in my life and it would never have come to that. I suppose I was just in need of some male attention as things were up and down with my partner at times, but we're in such a good place now. He supported me through losing my mum, was my rock, and we have another child together since. But the regret is eating me up and I'm wrried gossip has spread and will affect my career the rest of my life.

I’m so depressed I have no motivation to eat,3,1.0,2024-06-13 09:27:58,"Sorry for the long post, it’s mostly me ranting about my life. I could really use someone to talk to.


I’m going through the worst part of my life. My boyfriend who I have an extremely strong relationship with has decided to go into the military. His training is 8 months long, I got to see him 2 months in and then 4 months in, but now the last 4 I won’t see him at all. I can’t even speak to him because he’s not allowed his phone. I’ve had severe attachment issues my whole life and have probably cried a total of imma say 100 hours over this. I used to have really bad panic attacks. 

Found out a few months after my boyfriend left that my only grandparent, that I’m close with suddenly has stage 4 lung cancer and has 3 months left to live. She was in remission and considered cancer free last summer and then bam. She’s going downhill so fast, they just put her on the oxygen mask and it’s terrifying. This is the first death I will have to deal with ever and I don’t know how I’m going to get through it without my person with me. 

A few weeks ago I stopped being friends with my only friend because she hasn’t given me any support whatsoever in the past 4 months. I have to beg her to hangout with me even though she’s my literal next door neighbour. On top of that I work 50 hours a week and she works 15 and yet she can’t find time for me. 

I live with my two sisters, niece, and mom. My one sister which is my best friend works the opposite shift as me so we don’t see eachother at all, only on weekends. I get off late and when I get home everyone’s usually asleep or too tired to spend time with me. I’m constantly alone. I have no one to text, and can’t make friends that I feel comfortable with. I just hate people and always feel judged so I don’t like letting people in, I’ve also never met anyone other than my partner that GENUINELY is interested in me as a person and deeply cares for me. I just miss him so much. 

And the cherry on top is how much I hate my fucking job but can’t leave it because I won’t get the kind of pay I do anywhere else. I work so far from home and am constantly gone, when I’m home I deprive myself of basic needs such as eating because I don’t want to waste my free time, I’m also chronically lazy. If I didn’t have to look presentable for work I’d probably shower once a week. I also rarely have an appetite and actually have a hard time eating in general because I’m always running on empty. I usually eat once every two days, I try to go for atleast once a day which is good for me but only if it’s a full meal, which it usually isn’t. 

I’m not constantly sad, but everytime I’m alone and have time to think, I am. Even the small things like how I’m too lazy to eat make me extra sad because it feels pathetic. And just extremely depressing. I’ve lost 20 pounds since my boyfriend left. I honestly just want someone to talk to me and try to support me and maybe give me some ideas on how to get my shit together. Even if you can’t give me any help/advice, support would be nice. I honestly even feel pathetic posting this because I know what I’m going through isn’t that bad, but I just genuinely have no one to talk to and really needed to type it all out for someone to read and understand.

Thought I witnessed my cat die,1,1.0,2024-06-13 14:52:43,"I was coming home late from the gym the other night, and saw a fox biting on a cat in the middle of the road , so ran over and scared the fox off. Looked down and noticed  (at that moment) it was my cat. Neck sliced and blood pouring out, motionless but she was still warm. It was around midnight, and so nobody was around, and I didn't know what to do. I felt myself start to tear up, gently stroking her, apologising for not getting there quicker, apologising for not letting her on my lap the previous day. She looked so defenseless and harmless laying there, and it didn't make sense that something so cute and harmless had such a violent exit in the world. I started to cry, because of what she went through, and how guilty I felt, and how much is will hurt my family when I tell them. 
I stood over her, diverting the odd car that came by. Some people stopped and asked, I answered, and they showed compassion, and I felt bad that they felt bad they couldn't 'help'.
After about 15 minutes standing over her in the rain, I mustered up the courage to take my jumper off and pick her up to carry her home. 
After a few attempts, and constantly muttering 'sorry' to her, I carried her back home. She was the daughter of our older cat, and I was terrified to go into the house and bring this news. 
I went in, went upstairs and woke my parents up as I didn't know what to do, through whimpers and light cries, I told them I found her dead on the street (all whilst holding her in the dark in my arms). They were obviously confused and upset, and we went downstairs, only to find my cat by the backdoor- pawing to get out. I realised I had brought a random dead cat home. Laughing, crying, confused, angry, stunned. I was feeling everything. 
Very fortunate that it was not my cat, but very sorry that it was someone else's. 
I had felt like I had to go through the stages of grief just to pick her up and carry her home and move forwards, only to find out that it wasn't my cat. 

After calming down, and questioning whether I'm an idiot for not recognising it wasn't my cat, I showed a picture to my family, and they were all certain they would have mistaken her for our cat aswell. 

I didnt realise I felt so strongly for my pet. I knew I cared and loved her etc, but it was a large shock to what extent. Perhaps it was the situation that made it worse. 

This happend 3 days ago, and still I don't feel emotionally back to normal. 
I kept telling myself when I was out there in the road, trying to pick her up, that it's 'just a cat', 'just pick her up', 'stop being overdramatic and just do it, you can't leave her out here'. 

Don't really know why I'm posting it here, but it was just such a huge emotional roller coaster, and I just needed to vent it. ",mentalhealth,Look_Beneath,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1df0whb/thought_i_witnessed_my_cat_die/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06
Okay so now I am starting to get concerned. ,1,1.0,2024-06-13 14:51:20,"I have a habit of instilling fear on my own for the things I cannot get. Growing up, I was always adjusting to everyone and aside from food, clothes and school, I don't have anything. Basically, I don't have any priorities like my peers.

This is actually messed up but because my dad has anxiety disorder and also have a specially abled brother, all the attention was onto them and i was just going through the flow. Since I desire something very rarely, the one I had in mind will be so intense that I can't even stop thinking about it. Just as simple as getting a new sandal, i can't get one because I have to convince my dad for it when he just thinks in a different way about it. I became an alien in my school because of how different was I am.

Was I wrong for telling my doctor I have an eating disorder?,1,1.0,2024-06-13 13:13:13,"Hello everybody,

So today I had a doctors appointment to re- go over some labs that had been ongoing on in attempts to get my hypothyroidism under control, as well as my high cholesterol. My doctor originally sent me a referral to a nutritionist, who I met up with to discuss a plan of action. I left the nutritionist appointment feeling highly discouraged and overall, checked out. During this appointment I discussed with the nutritionist that I would mainly like to focus on disordered eating, and focusing on eating more protein and getting into a better food routine. The nutritionist stated that disordered eating ""Was all in your head"" and then proceeded to focus on dieting to lose weight, which I told them, I wanted my interest to be on eating healthier, not losing weight. I told my primary doctor about this, and my concerns about having an eating disorder. She asked what eating disorder I had and told her I had binge eating disorder, and told her I was unable to work on it further because of the pandemic, and because I was recieving free therapy through my college, I was taken off the list because I was not actively suicidal. What I did not tell my doctor, was that I originally started seeing a therapist for high anxiety and depression, and that the topic of body dismorphia and eating disorders came up later, and briefly because the pandemic started in the following weeks. I was not formally diagnosed for anything, but my therapist and psychiatrist were pushing for depression and anxiety meds. In terms of having an eating disorder,  this is something I've been struggling with since I was 12 years old. Was I in the wrong for doing this? Am I faking an eating disorder? Should I have pushed for a formal diagnosis?

What does it mean to “work on yourself”,1,1.0,2024-06-13 13:10:10,"I (22m) have recently agreed with my partner who is currently travelling for 6 months that we need a break. We have lived together during a stressful time in our life where we both have lots going on independently. 
We love each other deeply and it hurts the both of us to say we need a break - but right now we do. We both have agreed that we might reconcile when she’s back and give it another go (only if things are right and life allows us to)

Many aspects of my life are a mess. In fact most of it is currently is. I want to change myself for the better, genuinely for me. And if I want any chance of maintaining positive relationships with the people I love, I also need to do this. 

I’m currently unemployed which has been difficult for the last few months - but I have studied for the last 5 years and have a degree and currently figuring employment/my career out.

Because we are apart, and because I have a lot of time in my hands I figured that the time to start working on myself is NOW. 

But my question is - HOW? What does it look like to “work on yourself”? What does it entail and what does it involve me actually doing for myself?

how to stop genuinely caring what other people think,1,0.67,2024-06-13 12:13:33,"I am having a hard time to really not care about what other people think of me - or what I believe other people think about me. To be clear, I am not speaking about situations or aspects where it would be 'normal' to care what other people think (in the sense that almost every human being would care).

Instead, I am speaking about situations where another person's opinion 'shouldn't' matter. E.g. if I have a hobby, I am afraid other people think I suck at it. Due to this, I am afraid to e.g. play an instrument in front of other people, because I am afraid they will judge me. If I imagine this judgement, I also ruminate about it and feel anxious / like a loser.

Another example: I don't get along with my coworkers so well and really don't like them (among others because they make racist and homophobic remarks, but also because we don't match in terms of age and lifestyle). Due to this, I keep to myself at work. Especially the nasty remarks make it feel 'unsafe' to self-disclose around them, as I have a history of being bullied. Still, despite the fact that I don't like them and also see them as pathetic, I still worry about their opinion a lot - e.g. that they think I am an awkward loser without social skills.

"How to process my failures, if these are really failures? ",2,1.0,2024-06-13 08:24:29,"Hi,

So my issues are very complex. Sometimes I can't decide if I'm a cool ""rockstar"", or a complete failure. Because we/I can see these situations in a very bright way as well. But I can see my life in the complete opposite way too. And sometimes I feel that it's a failure in reality, or at least not a really successful life. And I don't know what is the reality. And if its really a complete failure, then should I fix some stuff very quickly, because if not, something even worse would happen, or if everything is perfect in this way. So please help me see the situations more clearly.

**Studies:**

Positive:

During my university, I have achieved lot of awards, I had fame and glory, teachers praised me, I had invited to meetings with the leadership of the university, along with other 1-2 students, etc. I have received a national golden medal as well, in a competition.

Negative:

This was a pretty small university, it just entered a university state during my studies. And the other students were simply partying all time, and I focused on my studies double time, because I didn't do really anything else than learning and project works. So is it really considered as a big success?

**Career:**

Positive:

I have achieved a lot of my childhood dreams. I could do jobs, which I never thought I would really do. I know very few can even enter these kind of jobs remotely, and I could do remote works for places and companies I would never think I will. And I don't think I would starve at any time.

Negative:

During my whole 8 years of career, I was fired 3 times for low performance. It was shocking, I never saw these before, and I thought I did everything I could. I loved 2 jobs out of these 3. This is my biggest pain, because I felt some kind of success in my studies, and I thought my efforts will pay off. These happened while firing 1 other person as well in both places out of the 3. But still, I received that negative feedback in both places. Although I'm I really don't want to switch careers or learn something entirely different. And I feel its not arguable at all. I already thought about that, but I just can't switch. I know people who were never fired in their career. Why to be happy for a hardly-reachable job for many, if I lose that in a relatively short time?

**Relationships:**

Positive:

I had a happy 2 year long relationship without any arguments. I also had some shorter ones. All happened with some women I considered like top models, I loved them.

Negative:

The 2 year long could exist only because of the COVID. There wasn't any dating during that time, and when it finished, she just left me. And there's a woman, who literally hates me. I didn't know for a long time, how to react to some situations, and I tried to joke with sensitive topics, etc. I'm already over 30, and I had never have any wife or kids. I know people who could be in a relationship in their entire life. Then why to be happy about this?

So is it a success or a failure? Objectively, where can I be in my life? Am I progressing well? Am I behind most of the people? Is there anything, which is critically bad, and should be fixed ASAP, because later there will be some big issues I don't see now?",mentalhealth,RandomDoctor2,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1detzc4/how_to_process_my_failures_if_these_are_really/,0,2.0,0.0,4.26823282356406e-06
I miss high school so much that it’s making me depressed. ,1,1.0,2024-06-13 12:03:18,"Throwaway bc I’m embarrassed.

I’ve been out of high school for over a full year now. Coming up in august it’ll be 2 years since i started my senior year.

For most of my school experience, I was in a small private school, up until my 8th grade year, when we switched to home schooling. We only did that for one year, as it wasn’t really for us. 

The year that followed, my freshman year, I was sent to public school. I didn’t really feel like i fit in there, and wasn’t sure what to do. Then, Covid happened. We were all stuck at home, which wasn’t too hard for me to handle. I spent my Sophomore year at home as well. 

My Junior year was different. I decided to enroll in a career-based school that puts you in classes depending on the job you wanted to do later in life. I decided to go into the graphic design path. There, I finally found my people. Everyone was friends, everyone was so nice. I have never felt so included and comfortable in my entire life. I met some amazing people, and made some amazing friends. That year is the absolute highlight for me. I even met a wonderful girl.

That girl and I started dating towards the end of the year, and that summer was spent hanging out with her and friends nearly daily. It was so perfect. I miss it so much. 

Later on that summer, things sort of fell apart a little. The girl and I broke up. That destroyed me. One of my best friends moved to Florida. That destroyed me too. I have never really fully recovered from that breakup I don’t think. I still think about her all the time, even though it’s been nearly 2 years. 

Senior year wasn’t as fun. I spent most of my time longing for her, hoping for a second chance. It almost happened too.. but it fell right through my fingers. 

Now, I’m almost 20, and I absolutely do not know how to get over this. I’m miserable.

I was molested by a family member,1,1.0,2024-06-13 11:49:54,"Even before I started writing here today, I thought to myself, ""I must be a cornball type of guy"" just because I wanted to anonymously get something off my chest. There's a pattern like this, with all my thoughts, that I have been seeing a lot lately. 

  
I honestly don't know where to start with this post so I'm just gonna start at my earliest memories.

When I was around 5 years old, I stayed with an immediate family member. A whole lot of my family was there,  I could never name off everyone. This made things especially challenging after all these years, because instead of having 1 person I can cast blame on, I only have ambiguity. There were many, and multiple people, who hurt me as well as others.

I have this early memory of being with my Older brother, well call him BOOF. Boof and I were always so energetic and happy when we were young, jumping into pools n shit. One day, we were next to some shed on the same property where I remember my cousin performing sexual acts on both of us, while being guided by an adult. To this day, neither me nor boof can remember who this adult is. I suppose it is for the best, because getting away with murder doesn't sound ideal. Well, me and boof endured this and have talked only once in our lives about it. 

I reluctantly brought it up one time, about 5 or so years ago, and he just told me he swore it was a dream. He said theres no way it could've happened. After explaining I endured the same thing as well as saw him there, in the fucked up position, we both agreed to NOT talk about it ever again with anybody. 

Well today, I'm coming out. I did already tell my spouse. He is very supportive about it as well. Boof will not discuss it for a while I'm afraid, unless he told his gf behind closed doors. We are very similar in this way, so its very likely.

As grotesque as the memories are, theres a lot of weird twists and turns that come up when I reflect. Sure, I could get mad at my cousin, but it would be pointless. She was around the same age as me and was just following what fucked up instructions she had received from some fucked up relative. There was a court case that I recently learned about that involved my favorite uncle, but he was proven innocent somehow. All I have is pain, exhaustion, and questions which will never be answered.

Sorry if I'm rambling, its just that I heard if I share my story, the pain might start decreasing more.

I just. Can’t. Do. It. I know I’m being childish and stupid and let things get to me too easily. Obviously, almost no one likes their job. But, I don’t know how they then have the ability to know they have to get up, day after day, and go do something they can’t look forward to.

"I Do Everything For My Mental Health, But Still Depressed - Why?",1,0.67,2024-06-13 10:33:13,"Hi all,

For a good number of years now, I have struggled with continuous, albeit moderate, depression. Ever since a break up when I was 18 where I messed things up, that was the first time in my life when I felt properly depressed, and ever since then things just haven't quite been right, despite being completely over the situation and the girl in question (I'm 29 now).

My depression is not the kind that keeps me up all night crying or stops me from eating, but just a constant low mood that stops me from enjoying life or being excited at anything. I have ADHD as well, which doesn't help matters when it comes to motivation.

That being said, I do absolutely everything to help my mental health:

* I practise yoga
* eat healthily (vegetarian for 4 years, but supplement with B12, Iron, D, Omega 3, etc)
* avoid ultra processed foods (80-90% of my diet is natural foods)
* Take a probiotic daily
* run 50km a week
* gym 3 times a week
* avoid pornography
* healthy sex life
* Walks with my dog twice a day
* Reducing caffeine consumption to minimal amounts
* Counselling (this didn't help, however, because I had no trauma or 'bad thoughts' to discuss. I'm just low)
* Socialise with friends at my running club
* Journaling positivity and achievements of the day
* TDCS Headset Use - Day 6 so far

Doing all of the above and feeling hopeless about the future and my mental health is mind boggling to me, and it's really starting to get to me. God knows how I'd feel if I didn't do any of the above.

I'm not requesting medical advice necessarily, but any thoughts on my situation would be much appreciated, even just some guidance on anything I haven't thought of or looked at.

People on the internet need to understand this one thing,3,0.8,2024-06-13 04:31:02,"You can hop on reddit, get on a burner account, and wreak absolute havoc with zero repercussions. 

You can respond to someone’s post about how they want to off themself and decide to tell them they’re a horrible human being for putting other people through that. 

You can judge someone for using Reddit or the internet as a source of help. 

You can make the conscious decision to bully someone who is at rock bottom. 

It’s so incredibly easy being mean to people you don’t know. You’ll never learn their name, you’ll never see them in person. You’ll never feel the guilt or see their face when they read your disgusting message. 

Like I said, there’s zero repercussions. 

I’ll still never be able to understand why people do it. Why trolls are a thing. Why people find gratification in doing these things. 

We learn to ignore the “internet trolls,” or we hear “don’t let them get to you,” as a response. But we continue to allow it to happen. It’s almost expected of you to just brush off rude comments and you’re weak if you let them get to you. Why is that? How come they don’t put algorithms in play to stop trolling from happening? Bullying on the internet has caused a lot of issues. 

It’s one of the most disgusting things on the planet in my opinion. 

Personally, I’ve reached out for help. Several times. Been at rock bottom, several times. Wanted to off myself, several. times. And every time, I’d get rude comments that just made me want to do it even more. 

One rude comment almost trumps 5 nice ones. And they know that.

But now that I have started to actually talk to the people who are actually smart - I realized how stupid, idiotic in fact, I am. And this drives me crazy, since it was the only thing I had. 

I heave health problems, bad vision, I am not the president person in the world at all, I am full of strange and unhealthy habits, I am, what many might call, a sicko when it comes to anything sexual and I try to keep myself away from many people. And all that I compensated by telling myself ""Well, at least I am smart enough to feel complete by myself."" But I am afraid this is not a case anymore. I really lack critical thinking, lack understanding of many things and also unbelievably lazy and have attention problems.

My parents have been working away for first 10 years of my life and I only got to see my mother for two months every year and but I did see my dad a bit more and I liked him growing up and absolutely despised my mother.

My dad retired from the force when I was 6 and I lived with him and my grandparents,  even though he was there he was an absent parent. 

Just reading about absent parent syndrome and as an adult I have all the issues like clinginess, anxiety, jealousy and  fear of abandonment, low self-esteem and always deemed as a bad person for being blunt and saying everything to the face.

I am going to tie the knot soon and I feel like I will fuck up my marriage.

Being my parents not around, my uncles and aunties always put me down to make  me look like I am horrible sibling to my little brother and  a bad kid in the family. 

Even my dad was present in my life from the age of 6 he used to make fun of me Infront of his relatives to make them laugh and never defended me whereas his siblings protected and defended my cousins. I was almost everyones banter donkey and got hate for no reason.

Even writing this getting me teared up and my wedding is around the corner. I burst into tears everytime I get angry and can't control my emotions. My fiancée says it's fine but sometimes I feel like she thinks I am weak, for instance ""she asked me why are you getting emotional and crying"". As a man this hurt me a little as I felt like she's questioning my masculinity.

Dealing with Anxiety,1,1.0,2024-06-13 09:13:16,"Hi everyone,  
Lately, I've been feeling really anxious and confused about my sexual identity. I want to make it clear that I am absolutely sure I am straight. I've never felt attracted to men emotionally or sexually, and I can't imagine holding hands with or kissing another man.  
But even with this certainty, my mind keeps telling me that people around me might think I'm gay, especially since I'm naturally shy, quiet, and very soft-spoken guy. This anxiety makes me feel very awkward in social situations. Sometimes, I also notice people looking at me strangely, and it happens quite frequently, as if they're thinking, ""What's wrong with this guy?""  


I can't afford therapy right now, so I'm hoping to get some advice and support here.  
I would really appreciate any tips on how to handle this anxiety and how to deal with situations where this worry comes up. Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you manage it? Any resources or reading suggestions would also be really helpful.

I’m currently taking 10 milligrams of buspirone twice a day and 150 mg of Bupropion Hcl xl/Wellbutrin xl.

The spells i did oftentimes came true with very high accuracy. 
In the last 2-3 years that became even more extreme. I started sensing things and felt that i had supernatural powers. I ""sensed"" supernatural beings around me, i had a tree send me messages through my mind and lead me to a place through a pendulum that it had previously shown to me through my mind. I was sure there were two spirits watching over me that protected me. I believed that God's were watching over me and sending me signs.

I try my best not to over rely on my friends, but I will admit I've needed a little more support as of late because this year has been very difficult for me and I'm just so tired and uncertain about the future.

And then I see this sentiment that depressed partners in romantic relationships are a burden. Non-depressed partners going on about how they're tired of their partner's mental health problems, how they suck the life out of them.

Depression is such an isolating illness. No one can reach into your head and take the pain away from you. You have to put in the work and save yourself. People get tired of listening because they have their own problems. And to think that I have to be on high alert not to burden my partner makes me think it might be better if I remain single.

Couple that to having unsupervised internet access from as young as 5, and I was set to be an outcast. I had a few friends, but I would only see them out of school maybe once a year. Even then I ate alone during lunch because of food sensory issues.

I didn't go to any homecoming or prom events, because I just wanted to stay home and play video games. At the start of high school, I had an okay social life, had some friends I was somewhat close with. But reading through their instagram and seeing them go to Disneyland and the movies and all this awesome shit without inviting me made me feel left out. So out of anger I started making some threats to shoot up the school. After the police came to my house on Christmas Day while extended family was visiting, I was in a psych ward for 3 days.

After the visit I had to meet with the superintendent and ended up having to switch to smaller, more poorly run classes instead of the standard, more populous ones. I lost so many friends after that. I gave up. At least there was the hope of college being better.

I feel like a person with good mental health who’s pretending to be a in a worse state then I am.,1,0.67,2024-06-13 05:55:20,"Hey I’m a 15 yr old male who is trying to make sense of the way I’m feeling. I have never really used Reddit but I can’t find anything online to really explain the way I’m feeling and I guess I’m seeking someone who can relate or explain? To be honest I kinda feel like a good person who’s pretending to be worse than I am. For example I convinced my mom to allow me to see a therapist but I find myself feeling like I’m lying to my therapist for no reason. When I originally wanted to go to a therapist, it was because I was cutting myself. Thinking about this I start to wonder if I was just doing it for attention or I just wanted people to see that I was cutting myself. I feel like I’m pretending that I have stronger feelings than I do. The only way I can think of explaining this is kind of a numbness, but I tell people I’m feeling a way that I should be in that scenario. Like when my father went to rehab, I didn’t really care, weirdly enough. But when people asked me, I kind of broke down and cried about it but when I think about it, I don’t know why I did that when I honestly didn’t care I feel like I pretended like that was some thing that affected me very heavily. I guess to say that I have good mental health would be an overstatement in a way because I kind of just feel numb about most things.

My parents are attentive towards my younger sister’s mental health but they ignore mine,1,1.0,2024-06-13 05:48:31,"Very sorry for any grammar mistakes. Unfortunately, English isn’t my native language.

My (F18) parents are always so attentive and helpful towards my younger sister and her mental health. Not too long ago, they told me that she had admitted to having a girlfriend. My parents are very religious people which led to them taking this issue very seriously. I won't go into detail regarding the whole ordeal but it was bad. My-sister-tried-to-run-away-from-home bad. My parents decided to bring her to a therapist due to this and other issues. From then on, my sister has been seeing a therapist very frequently. I don't like to boast but I do deem myself as a supportive person and I have been nothing but very helpful regarding the situation wuth my sister.

However, I've been facing a lot of issues for a long time and all l ever wanted was to seek proper help that isn't from a school counsellor who reduces my feelings to typical ""high school girl"" feelings. I just finished my final exam and graduated school which means that appointments won't bother my studying schedule. I wish I could put into words about my issues but l've always found it difficult. What's odd is that my parents acknowledge my severe anxiety and they never fail point it out - along with multiple other problems I face. They mentioned bringing me as they suspect I'm autistic but nothing has been done yet they constantly make jokes on my suspected autism which led me to believe they were simply joking all this while. I'm genuinely clueless and I physically can't bring myself to be vulnerable about this to them or ask them to take me to a psychiatrist. I don't know what to do.

I might've missed out on some things as I wrote on a whim while feeling distressed. Please give me a bit of guidance. I'd really appreciate it.

Anyone that feels the same in early 20s?,5,1.0,2024-06-12 20:36:55,"Hi guys, I'd like to share some insights, and hopefully start a positive discussion with anyone that might feel the same, just so we may know that we are not alone in this.

So, I'm in my early 20s and lately I've really been hit by some bitter emotions regarding my life experience and where I'm currently at. Actually I would be classified as an ""on time"" or ""regular"" young adult. Right about to finish my uni studies, learned to live on my own and stuff like that. 
Still, I feel like I missed on many things both in my teenage years and in my early adulthood. When I was younger it was due to the fact that I was lacking mental care and I couldn't do many things. Now that I'm almost fully recovered thanks to a few years with professional help, I find myself in a healthier mental state, and I truly know how to face situations with a balanced attitude. But the thing is, I feel like healing took a big part of my life away, and now I'm not where I would have thought my promising life would have been. 

I started to obsess over the fact that I'm average on many things, while I'm surrounded by some cases who are making exceptional things. I never made a penny while others are having great ideas on business and succeeding in that (recently started to learn some business related skills with 0 results, and I am very discouraged. Without any money I feel like I cannot do many experiences), never gained a circle of friends (During these years I was very focused on my studies and goals, while others seemed to be on a party-mode all the time, so either was difficult to relate or it was difficult for me to find people that were lovely and interesting to be with on a deeper level. Loneliness is another big feeling rn), and overall I experienced a constant sense of trying not to stay behind other folks (and that sucked all my energy) rather than feeling like having a good starting point to learn, grow, and discover things and relationships that will make me happy and richer inside. 

I don't know how to overcome this sense of feeling lost and not having done anything special with my life. To me regular stuff is like an usual procedure that needs to be done.

Hopefully I explained myself, since this is not my mother tongue. Willing to listen from your perspective!

I messed up. ,2,1.0,2024-06-13 00:08:31,"So, quick rundown first. The last month has been extremely rough on me.(21 M)

I lost my job, got dumped, and blew the transmission in my faithful old truck, all in the same day. I couldn't get any help with my truck, couldn't afford a shop, so I called my deadbeat father that I have spoken to 4 times in the last 15 years. He showed up, helped me drop my transmission, found out it would cost too much to rebuild, and he just up and left. Haven't heard from him since.

Now to the me part. Last Thursday, I did a bit of binge drinking, thinking it would help me out with my depression. Needless to say, it did not. I ended up sobbing in my truck with a [redacted] to my head. My best friend in the whole world managed to make me see sense, and brought me back. I've really come to depend on her. We talk all day every day. She is the best person I know. 

Then, on Saturday evening, I got a major nosebleed that lasted 3 hours straight and ended with me in the ER because I lost 2 pints of blood. Obviously that made me extremely woozy. The blood loss, coupled with the anxiety and depression, and a bit more alcohol because I didn't learn my lesson, lead me to a full mental breakdown Monday evening. And of course, I panicked and directed all my pent up emotions at my best friend. She hadn't been responding at all that day, and my abandonment issues due to aforementioned father lead me in a downward spiral of overthinking where I thought I was losing her too. So I lashed out. And it was bad. 

I haven't heard from her since. And that really hurts. Because the two of us have similar mental issues, and we've become kinda codependent. So losing her has just torn a part of me out. I hope I can recover. I hope I didn't drive a wedge between us permanently.

And of course, I have made my first appointment with a therapist. 

I'm sorry about the vent post, but other than her, I have nobody to talk to about this, and I guess I came here to see if anybody had some advice for me about any of this. Feel free to ask questions.

Test day panic attack,2,1.0,2024-06-12 23:39:20,"Hi all, I’m (42M) ADHD and have started an extensive professional certification in wine this year (WSET4). I never finished college because of undiagnosed ADHD and lack of motivation. I’m now 14 years into a successful career in the wine industry and have decided to push myself by going for this certification. I’ve never know how to study and have only recently started figuring out what works for me. 

Today was my 2nd of 5 exams for this certification and I absolutely fucking melted down this morning before the exam. For the last 10ish days, I’ve found that studying has been even more difficult for me. I read a passage in the book and review flash cards but no matter how many times I review I could not get a lot of things to stick. My brain just seemed to be blocking me from inputting new information. I’d reread the passage again, then close my eyes and ask myself the question. Every single time, I could remember 3/4 things and I could visualize the text but the part I couldn’t remember was just blank in my mind. After rereading the same passage 3 times this morning and realizing it wasn’t sticking with 2.5 hours to go before the exam, I just went into a full on panic attack. Thankfully my wife was home and she just remained calm and listened to me cry and talk and after a 30 minute walk I calmed down enough to go take my exam. There is nothing really on the line here other than time and money to retake the exam and I told myself that repeatedly but it’s like my brain just wants me to succeed so badly that I can’t handle the thought of not passing.

My anxiety drives me insane,4,1.0,2024-06-12 19:32:28,"Hello reddit people. As soon as I could think I knew something is off. To put it briefly, I might have an anxiety disorder due my childhood. I‘m very much aware of where it comes from, so I don‘t need any thoughts on that. So now, after I wanted to change my course of study and therefore had to look for a new university, it got worse and worse. I‘m living alone and I have some friends I barely meet, because they are very busy just like me before. I really want to finally step into the career I always wanted, but something holds me back. I see some good opportunities, but I‘m too insecure to apply. It sounds ridiculous even for me. But it‘s not everything. For example, I see people going out talking to strangers and that leads to cool experiences. Whenever I try that I have the will, but something is holding me back. I don‘t even overthink possible and exaggerated outcomes, even when I think positive, it‘s like a force in my chest saying ”maybe not today“. I hate it. I‘m fully aware, that this is just trauma response for keeping me safe, but being aware doesn‘t help at all. Yes, I‘m already seeking out for professional help. That leads to three problems: 1. In my environment, there are hardly any therapists I can effort. Also most waiting times for them are like two years or more. 2. Why do you have to call to request an appointment because of your anxiety? Whenever I talk to someone on the phone, embarrassing moments happen to me. 3. I had a bad experience with a therapist once. I was new and he didn't even looked at me the whole conversation and asked why I was there. How can you simply answer that? I had an anxiety attack which leads to him asking me out of practice. It signaled to me that me and my problems are not wanted. 
I'm sick. I just want this ”holding back force“ to finally disappear. I don‘t expect help from people in my environment, the topic about mental illnesses are hushed up. Stepping out of my comfort zone hardly helps me personally. I noticed that during presentations at school. It never got better, not until the end.

Dark phase is over but mentally exhausted - part 3,1,1.0,2024-06-13 02:45:30,"My biological mother still alive bt my biological father passed away.I for so long, grew up with anger and resentment on my biological father due to his lifestyle and comments given by adopted family and extended family and even during my wedding, we had an arguement and none from my biological family attended my wedding.But few weeks before passing away, my biological father asked about me and my wife with my biological mother, but since im wasn't talking much with my biological mother, i couldn't get this information. I attended his funeral and did the last rights. Ever since,i been visiting and talking to my biological mother but not frequently. I have a younger sister and younger brother from my biological parents, but we are not in good terms.The relationship soured when during their younger days, i found out that instead studying, my sister was going out with a guyi scolded her for this and promised to get her married and told her not to take any wrong decisions and instead to concentrate on her studies. she got pregnant and eloped with the guy, and came back and the guy ditched her and married another lady. She delivered the baby and my biological parents raised her kid. Now she is remarried. My younger brother dropped off school and the relationship with me soured when i scolded him for his drinking behaviours and for dropping off school. and now he is working for meager wages and heard that he is financially struggling. 
My biological mother asked me to support her financially as my brother and sister are struggling financially and later i found out that they are pressuring my mother to get money from me in pretense of expenses for my mother. I give her some cash whenever i visit as i felt too tired with all that going on.

In all this turbulence, one person who stayed true and strong with me, took me up when im down and broken was my wife.
They say that god doesn't give you what you like but what you need the most in your life. He gave her to me and i treasure her. I at times feel bad for being very emotional and treating her badly in the past during the dark phases of our life. She worked part time to support me when im was jobless for a year, ate one time so i could buy clothes for new job. At times, thinking back what she have done for me, my eyes get wet. I dont know what i did in my life to deserve her because all those around me and my wife, they were all fake peoples. Her parents stopped talking to her when she started financing her studies independently and didn't even attended our wedding.Its been 7 years they left her like that. 
But its always amazing how she always talks about how amazing i am, how i supported her during her hard and dark phase.

In between, both of us was jobless for a year due to company down sizing and couldn't service the loans properly, and was almost had my car repossed. Changed few jobs for higher pays, sustained toxic bosses and now still paying off the debts, but good thing is we have managed to pay off large chunks of debts owed to banks and family members. Now leaving the toxic company and boss for a better paying job with what seem to be a better working environment (hopefully).We got married 7 years ago and postponed having baby as we weren't sure about raising a kid with high debts.
During this period, financial constraints and family members toxic emotions took a toll on us. both of us suffered mental pain and had frequent fights. There were days when we have to use our entire salary to pay off rents and debts and left nothing to eat. It was the darkest moments in our life. now it looks bright for both of us.the financial obligations are still there but its not bad. we could pay off the loans and still have funds left for savings and personal use.

Help with a Son,1,1.0,2024-06-13 02:29:58,"Trying to make a long story short…

Son, 24, mental break about 4 weeks ago. Involuntary commitment for past 10 days. Coming home tomorrow. Refuses professional help. So I’m all he got. Help. How do I set him set himself right? Get him thinking clearly? Give him something to live for?

I have many ideas about the root issues.

But I think I need to get him to see one OR figure out how to live with all the issues.

He’s angry. He’s parinoid. He doesn’t know what his purpose is. He desperately wants to be something. 

But I think he wants to figure it out but he don’t know how, or wont try.

My question: are there activities that I can give him to figure it out on his own?

Gonna start with asking him to plan his next day in 2hr blocks. Up at 8, bed by 10, sleep by 12.

Giving him small things to do, like cook 2 meals a day. Walk the dogs for an hour, plant a garden.

I think making him journal is key. But he fears some reading it. Gonna make him write a page and burn it the next night. *shrug* Don’t know if that’ll work.

We could make this about me but I’d rather not…but we can…just be polite.

More details that you could skip:



6 out of 10 on the ADHD scale.

Gamer since 6yrs old. Was his escape place.

High internet consumption from 10 to 19. More hours on the net than sleep. All the things you see about online kids. He did it.

Highly intelligent.

Father had no clue.

Involuntary admission for Psyc issues. (Ummm, the health care system sucks…but they did the best they could, but yeah, I would only advise that route out of desperation)

"Tween is struggling, need advice ",1,1.0,2024-06-13 00:50:22,"I’m the older sister of my half sibling who is 12 (I’m 22). So my sister has attempted suicide at 11 and still cuts herself. When she attempted she had been to the mental hospital prior and was sent again. (And at the mental hospital she was taught more methods on how to hurt herself from the other kids). She has a therapist but she isn’t making any changes to her thinking. I try my best as her sibling, but as someone who’s experienced those same thoughts, I know that it comes down to changing your own mindset. 

This is my mother’s third child and she’s tired. Recently my sister was chatting on the suicide hotline and the police came to our house. My mom had a freak attack and screamed and we were all crying. My sister wanted to go to the hospital, but changed her mind when she remembered we have a concert for her favorite artist the next weekend. I don’t want to deny her feelings, but I’m not sure if she was actually suicidal since she completely changed her mindset to go to this concert.

She just said she wanted to kill herself again after being denied a sleepover. Has anyone had experience with this? My mother is going crazy and is driving everyone crazy but at the same time she’s also tried everything. I just don’t know what to do to help and am at a loss right now. Any advice would help, I’m anticipating the next time my mother breaks down and our family becomes a mess.

I’ve never wanted to relapse this badly,2,1.0,2024-06-12 20:29:44,"I’m (20f) 16 months sober from benzodiazepines after many years of battling with this addiction. While that craving never went away, it’s gotten easier to cope with over time. I know I’ll never NOT miss it, but I’ve been learning to live with that.

Last week, my long term boyfriend and I broke up. He was a huge motivation for me to stay sober, and in general just the love of my life. Losing him, and being no contact, has been so hard for me. Not a second goes by where I don’t miss him.

In turn, my craving to relapse has grown more and more to the point where it’s near impossible to ignore. Every time I think about my ex, my brain goes to “if you had valium right now, you wouldn’t be suffering this much” and things of that sort.

I know I’m stronger than my addiction, and I didn’t make it this far just to backslide, but the craving won’t stop. It’s driving me insane. All I want is for the pain to go away, and while I’ve been trying healthier alternatives (working out, journaling, etc.) all I can think about is how none of them can compare to how I feel when I’m high.

I’m in my own personal hell. I miss my man and I miss my pills and I miss the person I was one week ago. Everything is just so overwhelming and I know if I just had one pill, everything would feel better. But it’s never just one.

Finally getting to Chiang mai at 10ish pm and checking into the hotel I took a melatonin/chamomile supplement I got from 7/11 and slept for maybe an hour and woke up heart racing and mind racing. Couldn't sleep at all after that but got out of bed at 9ish to eat breakfast and walk around town. 

I think I messed up trying to take a nap around 4ish and got maybe an hour of extra sleep. Walked around some more and tried going to bed around 11pm but was up all night once again. At this point I was exhausted but mind racing and I started somewhat hallucinating and felt like I was in speed or something. 

Went to the clinic at 6ish am and they said I had severe anxiety and it led to insomnia and gave me 5 mg diazepam to take every night before bed and laxatives because the anxiety led to no bowel movements for almost 3 days.

I took the diazepam at around 930 because ei couldn't stand being awake any longer and slept until about 2ish and then hit the town again until 10 when I got back showered and took another pill only to sleep until 3 am and my heart is racing again and cannot fall asleep.

Where I am,1,1.0,2024-06-12 23:06:03,"Sometimes I have to take a step back and just appreciate where I am mentally. 

In early 2020, I left my now ex wife because I was totally miserable. I didn't go about it in the best way but with the benefit of hindsight, had I communicated more, it would have just prolonged the inevitable and we wouldn't have worked out. 

I became homeless and was taken in by a couple of friends. I ended up living with them for six months until I moved back in with my mum & dad. That was late 2020. 

In early 2021, the loneliness hit me and I became suicidal. I was living in a seaside town. There was one evening that was particularly stormy so I walked out to the sea front and stood there, seriously considering walking into the water. I ultimately decided not to go through with it because of the shadow it would cast over my nieces and nephew. 

Anyway, cut to 4 years later and I've met a woman I adore, who I'm engaged to. I've moved to Scotland to be with her, leaving my old life behind. I quit my job and found another up here. I can honestly say I've never been happier. 

I still think back to how I felt in those darkest moments. How hopeless it all was. And I can barely reconcile that feeling with the happiness and fulfilment I feel now. My point is that no matter how bleak it may feel, there can be light at the end of the tunnel.

Embarrassing Depressive Tendencies,1,1.0,2024-06-12 23:00:33,"In the past especially when I was a young depressed teenager I took to writing poetry as a way to try and work out my feelings in detail.
 Recently my depression and suicidal ideation have gotten particularly bad and I, from nowhere, just opened up notes on my phone and all this shit just came pouring out of me. I’ve only typed in it twice and those times were a month apart and those are to two paragraphs. Below is the poetry I don’t know what to do with it but I think I’d like it to be out there in the universe after I’m gone 

I will die on this room
And I’m trying everything from doctors to shrooms from work to rest but somehow I’m  just as depressed and my body is failing and my minds been gone for so long I only recall how to sing songs. And now I’m forgetting faces, I’m forgetting times spent, times had, voices and the fun we’ve had in these places. I’m living in Deja vu, everything is “I’ve heard that, I’ve felt this” and now I’m afraid I’ll forget you. 
I will die in this room, an embarresment a disgrace it’s all gone wrong and im just somebody not built for this place and there are tears on this face that I don’t recognise anymore, where’s the smile wheres the eyes where’s the voice my mother adores?
I will die in this room and I’m so glad the walls are painted, the sky has turned grey I’m infectiously tainted and it’s cold, it’s so damn cold as I watch myself grow old. 
I will die in the room and I can’t sleep sober intoxicated inebriated whatever feels like “this aint over” but there’s so much hate, calm down too late I’ve missed my chance. Watch it walk, don’t talk and speak when your spoken to. Don’t think don’t feel just do and don’t give up, give in. Be consumed by the life you think you’re in. 
I’m confused, I’m confused by misery by anger by love by fury am I motivated? eyes dilated? I feel ready for war and I have to be this be. 
This war never ends and I will die in this room 

I will die in this room and it’s getting a little closer, time to say goodbye raise a glass and toast her. Here’s to the ending of tide, still, peaceful water and whatever’s left inside so let me rest. It’s been a while, without the nightmares, this fear and sense I don’t belong here. Come see this life and steal it, I’m not sure if it’s just in my head anymore and I Swear I can feel it. On the tips of my fingers in shake across my brow or silence in my ears telling me to die now. Baby let me die, how can I go on like this. Too afraid to live and afraid to be free, afraid that I might take a couple people with me. God, just let me go first. I swear it’s for the best and it’s cold in the chest already. 
I will die in this room and I’m sorry I feel this way, but you’re all the reason I’m here day to day, maybe I’ll be gone today or maybe another day. Pushing pushing it back just a little further so I can see their smiles for just a little longer and I hope that I will remember. What it’s like to know you are loved, or to feel love, or give love or even just to believe in it anymore. I’m surrounded and left out. I don’t know the rules or how this works but I’ll figure it out until I can’t.

Imagination as a life raft,1,1.0,2024-06-12 22:29:41,"This is super long, and is not super important.



I'm not sure if this is the right place for it so feel free to delete it if not. But after a conversation with a friend, I thought I'd share what keeps me alive in my darkest moments. 

A bit of background; I struggle with bipolar disorder, ADHD and PTSD. I have numerous years of intense trauma and I suffer with the symptoms of PTSD everyday as a result. I'm also currently going through a depressive episode that kind of took me by surprise so it's been heavy days for sure. But there have been many heavy and dark days, and for some reason I've decided to stick around even when I have struggled to articulate why. I think I'm finally able to. I hope this helps or is at least semi-interesting.

I got into the whole manifestation train a few years back, and although I don't believe in it now I did gain one valuable skill from it; imagination. I mean the kind of extremely detailed intentional imagination, not an abstract fantacy. I use it to imagine, in detail (sounds, smells, sensations on my skin, buildings, weather etc.) what my life would look like if I didn't suffer so acutely with bipolar and ptsd. Who would I be? What would I sound like? What would my interests be? What kind of friends would I have? What would my apartment look like? What would my curtains look like? I mean in extreme detail, I have to be able to recall it as if it was a place I'd actually been. Sometimes I'll write it down or take a voice note if my brain is struggling to hold on to details, but usually the image and the emotions it conjures up is enough. 

I'm not a mental health professional so I can't explain exactly how this, frankly made up, image creates a sense of longing, but it does. This longing will usually stay with me for a while. Sometimes it'll make me sad (because it's not my reality) and sometimes it will make me angry (that I even have to imagine such a seemingly mundane existence). And in those feelings I'm able to process the pain I'm currently experiencing. It allows the feelings to come to the surface, and I can cry, I can write, I can stare at a wall and contemplate, it's different every time. But after a few days, the image will be almost like a memory (I'll obviously know I imagined this some days ago, and somehow (again, I'm not an expert), the image will become a kind of memory making it feel like something different than an imagination. Not quite a real memory, not quite a figment of my imagination. The feelings I feel when I think about it is real. The effort I took to conjure up the image is real, so the image becomes its own kind of not-real but still real thing. This feeling of attachment to the image will usually be enough to spark even a mustard seed of hope.

Not enough to suddenly be cured of depression, and not even enough to stop my unhealthy coping skills. But enough to want to believe that it \*can\* be real. Often times that desire for it to be real, will be enough to take tiny steps. A shower, a dish wash up, a reply to a friend or even searching up mental health professionals on TikTok to know I'm not loosing it. 

This was super long, and I'm sorry if it was useless. Thank you for reading, and excuse my spelling mistakes. Just thought I'd share in case it could be interesting/useful to someone.

He always denies being violent but they always were violent ,but one of the things he would blame me about and yell at me over is one time that they were fighting and it got really bad and he chokeslamed her into the wall and broke it,i was like 8-9 and when he left to his room i went to my mom and said she needed to leave him and he told me he overheard this and its always made him tense with me and untrusting to me. 

 there is one thing he told me and my brother that just recently has been making me so anxious and guilty. I didnt have an idea of what rape was when he told me this but now that i do its been eating at me. He told us once that he had to “force my mother to have us” and that she never wanted us in the first place. At first it disressed me and my brother started to cry when it happened but i got over it and forgot for a bit because my mother always loved us.But im home alone at his house right now and its driving me mad. My parents already have an 11 year age gap and my mom was 19 when she married,am i a product of rape??

 I feel disgusting thinking of this and so guilty i havent been able to even look at my self for a month now and i avoid wearing my glasses or contacts i cant describe how it feels.i feel so disgusted with myself because i think it means i wasnt even born normaly and lovingly i was born from him being violent.I used to just tell myself that maybe he meant she wasnt allowed to abort but my mom is quite religous and doesnt belive jn abortions in the first place. My mom used to tell us she was in college for political science and i love hearing her stories of her before us but now it makes me feel disgusting because the only reason she gsve it all up was because i was born and i literally took everything from her. And i feel extra guilty because i still miss my dad and i love him even though i find him disgusting and i dont like it when he touches me, im old enough to not visit but i still do voluntarily.

What did he mean by that? Am i wrong to still love him?

"How to free yourself from loneliness, low self esteem, and build a community",2,1.0,2024-06-12 18:17:48,"I’m a 27M who still lives with their parents in Maryland. For about the time I was in mid high school to now I’ve felt incredibly lonely. Over the years I’ve gone from friend group to friend group attempting to find tribe I can call my own. I’ve got a handful of really good friends who are about 3 years younger than me. I have good 9-5 with good benefits that is in my line of study. Good family,  parents, sister. On paper everything seems fine. But I’m not happy. 

All my life I’ve struggled with self esteem and confidence, but I never let it get to me until I was around 15-16. I isolated myself from the world in order to protect myself from all the negativity of shallow classmates and bad academic performance. In doing so I may have stunted my social and mental growth. I developed a stutter and even lower self confidence.

I found a church home recently and I like it and the people there, but I still have trouble connecting and truly bonding with folks there. To be honest I have trouble connecting to almost everyone I meet. It’s a wonder how I have the friend I have now.

I don’t really talk to anyone from high school or college anymore. I was sort of that weird socially awkward quiet kid in the back of the class. I wish I want though. I wish I was different. If I could go back in time I would change everything.

I used to be funny. I would make witty sarcastic remarks that people enjoyed hearing. Now I can barely muster up a sentence with stuttering. I want my confidence back. I want to be a person again. Someone people can look up to and respect. Someone who doesn’t get so sensitive at every negative remark thrown his way.

"I don't know what's wrong with me, everyday is torture",1,1.0,2024-06-12 21:59:12,"So I've been suffering mentally for a good while now but recently things have been getting much worse and I believe I need medical help. I have these horrible intrusive thoughts constantly. Literally every second of every day I'm trying to get rid of these intrusive thoughts by thinking positively but it only works like half of the time. These bastards that I hate won't get out of my head. I am sometimes in physical pain from punching and slapping myself because of these thoughts. I can't do anything. When I'm trying to do something I have to be thinking of positive people/words and if something negative comes into my head, I have to stop or start over. The word DEAD keeps coming into my head and other related words that involve injury or illness. I regret everything I do. Genuinely. Everything. I'm also incredibly indecisive, because I am so desperate not to end up regretting what I do. Which is normally what ends up happening. I keep thinking inanimate objects have feelings aswell. All these problems and these regrets I have in my life have been making me feel absolutely dreadful. I'm purposely isolating myself everyday and all I want to do is sit around playing video games all day on my own because I'm literally unable to do anything else. I've been feeling like ending my life lately.  I went to a doctor recently and the doctor said I have OCD. I feel like the things I said about the intrusive thoughts is what brought the idea of ocd up, but I'm not sure if the ocd is also responsible for the regrets, indecisiveness and worry. I think the plan was to take a prozac (fluxeotine) tablet so I'm not sure how much that helps or not. Maybe some people here have an idea of it. I'd appreciate any help or advice. Thanks.

I have a pretty normal life but everyday relatives constantly shame my looks, grades, and attitude which really hurts me. People in school describe me as cute, kind-hearted, and smart but I don't think so anymore. I haven't been eating at the right time and instead, I've been eating huge meals every night when everyone is sleeping to prevent from gaining weight. Every school night I would study from 6 pm to 3 am to get my grades up for the expectations of my school but never made it in the list of honors. My elders would tell me to grow up and practice for the adult world but they wouldn't let me out by myself nor help me. My cousins would make fun of my attitude because I always acted childish.

What is it and is it serious?,2,1.0,2024-06-12 17:44:26,"Recentely some of my weird behaviours and thoughts have been getting worse and I don't know if they are normal thus I'm overreacting or there is smt wrong with me and I should seek help.

1)When someone asks me to borrow something, especially my sister. Usually I either don't want to give away this thing bc ""it's mine"" or ""it belongs there and if you take it I'll have to worry all day about putting it back"", and if they don't give the thing back once they are done I get REALLY mad and sometimes even cry

2)I don't like unpacking my stuff from my suitcase bc then I will have to put it back on at the end of summer and if I leave there it's already ready and I don't have to fear I might lose something

3)Caring about how my things are positioned in my room and I HATE when somebody touches smt and I have to put it back in its place, mainly bc it has to be how I like it in my order and bc I'm scared I'll lose these things and maybe somebody (my sister) might take them and I won't realize.

4)When somebody wants to borrow something I might just gift it to them. Once my sister asked me if she could try my swimsuit on, and she ended up liking it so much she asked if she could borrow it and I just said she could have it. Then I went to the bathroom and cried for like a whole 20 mins and even started to cut through my skin with my nails almost to the point it bled. the only reasons I could find are that ""she deserves it more than me"", ""I wouldn't wear it either way bc it's too pretty for me and she's gorgeous so she'll definitely use it more"" and also that ""if I share it then at this point why have it"", I bought for me cause I never dress nicely bc I feel like who I am is just someone who doesn't care and maybe by buying and wearing this swimsuit I could escape this ""false/forced"" image I created and be free.

For the same reason I'm scared of dressing better: I literally wore the same 2 hoodies for the whole school year bc I had no courage to wear anything else and hear people comment (even if in a positive way).

5)Taking things as a form of self punishment and bc I don't deserve things. When I go out with my friends I don't buy anything or try to spend less as I can bc I feel too guilty spending my parent's money, also bc my sister spends a lot of it when she goes out and I fear my parents may not be able to afford another child who does this. Additionally when we're on a trip I always compare what my sister buys in total to what I bought and always hope I spent less money mainly bc if I spend less I know she can get what she wants bc after all ""she wants it"" and I should sacrifice some of my joy for hers. Like when we went to Malta once and my father took us to starbucks bc he knows I wanted to get smt there, however my sister also came and ordered something and I felt too guilty to take anything so I just said I wanted nothing.",mentalhealth,_Just_asking_stuff_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1decoxe/what_is_it_and_is_it_serious/,1,2.0,0.0,4.26823282356406e-06

I hate change. a couple days before Christmas my parents got a new set of utensils and threw out our old set and I sobbed because now all are utensils feel different and they aren’t correct, even 6 months later I’m still not completely used to them. this is also not the first time ive cried about dish ware getting changed. I’m not sure how many years ago it was but they got a new dish set and packed up the old one and again I cried. I’m used to the new set but I still don’t love it.

when I get overwhelmed I’ll end up pacing and if I’m really overwhelmed I’ll end up flapping my hands. honestly, if I’m alone I'm usually always moving in some way tho I find it hard to sit completely still.

I make eye contact so it can seem like I’m paying attention but I’m not sure if the average person consciously thinks that.

How do you ignore all the pain and suffering?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 20:39:05,"There is pain and suffering all over, all the time, and I have always been able to see it.

How do you do it? 

I will graduate law school and enter the workforce in less than a year.

I can’t stop seeing and feeling the pain and suffering of others, I have never been able to do that. And I can’t fix the problems myself as an individual. I keep setting up goals of things to do or try before I entertain suicidal thoughts any further, but the list keeps getting shorter and I am afraid that soon the only thing left will be to not burden my loved ones.

My whole lifestyle is about eating and sleeping and lying on bed scrolling my phone all day. My thoughts are so miserable that I can’t act on anything. I don’t feel like life is worth living and I feel all I am waiting for now is death. I am literally depressed.

 I’m turning 20 soon, I’m in college. I have no friends. I only interact with my few “friends” when I am in college. I have no individual identity of my own. 

Whatever I do I only do with my mom. It’s been this way ever since I was a child obviously. I love her insanely and she is equally obsessed and insane about me. I feel as a daughter, I should be there for her. She has lived a miserable life which has been full of struggles and she continues to live that. She has a certain amount of health issues as well. She is in an unhappy marriage ever since she was 16, my brother too has turned out to be a douche. All she has is me.

I can never have somebody better than her even as a friend, nobody compares to her. I can share anything and everything with her that one might share with their friends. From talking about boys, spirituality, deepest of conversations and deepest of secrets; we do it all. I have no filter with her, it’s as if she and I are just one person and not two different people.

Mutual breakups still suck,1,1.0,2024-06-12 20:00:23,"Been with this guy for 5 months and I know it wasn’t that long, but it still sucks. I’ve been dealing with depression for 5 years and I cope by crying. My now ex deals with stuff too, but he copes by getting drunk and high on the weekends. I always knew we would break up since he was usually emotionally unavailable and I was insecure. To be fair we lasted 5 months longer than I thought we would.
He’s been with a lot of people, but he was my first real boyfriend. He is genuinely the funniest person I’ve ever met and really brought me out of my shell.

The last couples weeks were bad. I felt bad for him since I felt like I was suffocating him with my baggage, while he felt bad for me since he couldn’t give me the attention that I wanted.
The last day we spend together as a couple was fun since we just spent hours hanging out and laughing which was a nice change. I asked him later if he actually wanted to break up since we were thinking about it for a bit. He said that he felt neutral about it and said he’s pretty indecisive (which hurt since it made me feel like he didn’t really care about our relationship). I told him how much I liked him and how I didn’t want to break up, but that I don’t think I’m mentally stable enough to be in a relationship.
We decided to flip a coin, best of 3. Heads means break up, tails means stay together. 3 HEADS IN A ROW!!! We just started laughing, but I was dying inside.

How to deal with a manipulative selfish mother who puts on an image of a nice caring mom,1,1.0,2024-06-12 19:55:51,"
Hello, i am trying to explain a complex situation in as less words as possible. Please deal with me. 

Long story short, i was brought up in an arab muslim family but my mom is a foreigner and became muslim when she was very young. Her childhood was filled with trauma which i believe is what led her to making that decision and run away from the toxicity. 

I love my family (me and 5 more siblings in total) and value them and my parents very much. They are dear and close to my heart, but I can’t deny that we were raised in a toxic way, where not much freedom of expression was allowed without being met with grimaces and long lectures, we were antisocial and nothing was done to address that (quiet antisocial kids is not what i would call healthy). 

Although that’s all past and i dont live in my old country anymore, the problems are haunting me because my siblings still are, two of them are still in high school. My dad died few years ago and within a year and a half, mom married another man. At first i was hesitant, but she assured us she will never leave her family and she will spend equal time with them as with her husband. This was far from the truth. 

She changed 180. She completely changed her values and opinions and became ok with things that were not accepted in our childhood, she really confused all of us and mentally added a element confusion to the loss we were already experiencing. I think my youngest siblings would not be able to comprehend that change at their age. 

She now spends around 1 or 2 days a week with them, sometimes even less. But while she found her new life, my siblings are at home, alone, antisocial as ever (because that’s the way they were brought up), and without a parent in the house. My sister is playing mom role… because she has no other choice, she is first year in uni!

My mom’s irresponsible behavior and her new “chapter” are deeply hurtful and bother me a lot. I am afraid my siblings will develop abandonment and mental issues (talking especially about the ones in high school) and i just dont know how to deal with it from afar. Talking is out of the question, i tried and she had so many counter arguments and excuses, I’m not actually sure if she’s aware how toxic or manipulative she is. 

Tldr: mom puts an image in our heads that shes a loving caring parent, but her actions say the opposite. She is neglectful and selfish, how to deal with this given that my siblings in high school now live alone with their sis who is still in uni are all alone in the house (no source of income and no friends). It is eating me alive.",mentalhealth,Efficient_Post_7080,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1defvso/how_to_deal_with_a_manipulative_selfish_mother/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06
"Without adderall, it feels like my brain won't turn on and function (prescribed for TRD, fatigue, sleep apnea)",1,1.0,2024-06-12 19:52:05,"Long story short... I have battled major depression/anxiety for over half of my life. I am 32 now. These last 4 years have been the most difficult years of my life. COVID hit (living in LA, CA so it was the worst), and then immediately I lost my Dad tragically and unexpectedly. He was everything to me. Then I lost my Aunt (basically 2nd mother) a few months later. My world was turned upside down. I tried to continue working a stressful job at an AI startup that I helped co-found but had to resign. Then I had a horrible snowboard accident, 2 damaged discs, a herniated/pinched nerve, and a severe blow to the sacrum/pelvis. Doctors during covid wouldn't do imaging so I didn't find this out until a year or more later. Then I reinjured my penis. My meatus (penis hole) has been slowly tearing over the years. It ripped significantly more. Went to doctor after doctor. No one said there was a fix to repair my penis.

I fell further and further into a deep, dark depression, mainly brought on by grieving but the chronic intense pain and no relief or answers made my spiral. In the past, psych meds had never worked well. For a bit then stopped or made things worse. I did intensive therapy, ECT treatment, TMS, and Ketamine, and even tried other meds out of desperation. Then I was prescribed Adderall off-label for TRD. It worked. It helped with the pain, put away suicidal thoughts, I could function, get back into treatment, and make music, wow! I'm not new to stimulants, meaning I've witnessed my brother with ADD go down that path of trying different ones. I didn't think I had ADD, maybe idk, but severe depression makes you feel like you do have it. Now, as some may know. Adderall wears off. There is a crash. Since I was depressed, the crash was unpleasant. More intense SI, anger, irritability. I've been on and off it for the past 2 years. I've gone lower and lower with some ups and feeling hopeful.

I notice now that when I wake up, it's almost like my brain is just off. I'm so slow. Hard to do basic things. It's hard to process, communicate, remember, and do the things that I need to continue doing to get healthy. Like treatment, exercise, preparing for upcoming urological surgery, being in the community, also preparing to go back to work, etc. basic life. I know I am rambling but it is such a love/hate relationship with this drug. I've tried and tried without it even for long periods do everything that would or can heal my mind, promote neurogenesis, and help me feel ""normal"" like it even works. I have Adderall xr 10mg and boom, I can function.

Is anyone else experiencing this or has it in the past? I'm trying to find natural remedies that mimic what the stimulants are doing to my brain. I'm also tapering off of Cymbalta slowly, I take gabapentin 3x a day, I have Xanax XR, and Xanax IR as needed, and tapering down on Seroquel for sleep. My goal is to slowly get off all meds but I feel like I need something else to add a buffer to negate the side effects/balance out my confused brain with all of the neurotransmitters. I'm not addicted to Adderall, will use it when I HAVE to be on, or I know will help in situations so I can function and not be a catatonic zombie.

Any feedback, ideas, thoughts, etc. - I am new to posting on Reddit but figured I would because I tend to find others that I can relate with.

Is there more to it?? ,1,1.0,2024-06-12 19:19:34,"Hi!! 20F here, diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and it is extremely likely that I also have OCD (many mentions of it in medical records, doctor and psychiatrist have stated that they think I probably have it, but they are uncomfortable with diagnosing me formally due to my age :// (yay UK healthcare). However, I’m worried there’s something else going on with me, but my doctor isn’t really listening to me and tends to dismiss me. 

I’m ridiculously mood swingy and to very Extreme levels. Most of the time I tend to just feel neutral, fine, but throughout my days I’ll have ridiculously low lows (e.g. feeling legitimately suicidal over something incredibly minor, or explosive anger that completely shuts me down. However, an hour or so later I can feel completely fine and happy again). I unfortunately am also quite hot and cold with people - my friends I would absolutely die for, but typically when getting to know people, it’s so easy for me to become irritated by something minor and start to resent them, or, if I feel like a person is losing interest in me, I’ll be sure to ice them out first before they can do it to me. 

I also go through periods of time where my libido shoots through the roof and I become ridiculously hypersexual, and this manifests in problematic ways for me. (More risky behaviour, shamefully I’ll flirt and be sexual towards people I am not attracted to because I love the attention and validation. (E.g., I am a lesbian, but during these periods of time I will be sexual towards men, even though I don’t really enjoy it, because it is much easier to get that validation and approval). When I stop feeling hypersexual I am very ashamed and feel embarrassed and guilty over my behaviour, but the cycle repeats.

My emotions just feel very intense and difficult to handle, but my doctor keeps insisting that everything is normal. I can’t help but worry that there’s more going on here.

When they feel hurt the whole world is burning down but the moment I am I get laughed at, mocked, or threatened ??  I just argued with my Dad about the safety of my beloved cats. I’m a huge animal person and theyre the one thing that keeps me from slipping. During this argument my Dad called me sensitive, straight up said he doesn’t care how I feel, and he believes my pets don’t love me as much as I love them. I try my best to avoid talking to both my parents but hearing my own Father say he doesn’t care how I feel hurts a little yk? I thought parents were supposed to be there to understand their kids not make them feel 10x worse.. It’s so frustrating when they get mad at me for not talking to them and when I do open up somehow I’m always the issue. I don’t like my parents partly because of the way they make me feel and the way they treat animals. I’m already depressed and they just keep making me feel worse and worse. I’m always the problem somehow. It doesn’t help that my Mom owns a senior dog and she’s been obviously sick for days and hasn’t been drinking water.

We live together and generally everything is great, even talk about marriage and future on and off and are well aligned in terms of both what we want and the lifestyle we would like to live.

We both deeply love each other and do our best to support each other. My partner had a pretty traumatic and abusive relationship in her early 20s that she still struggles with to an extent today (ptsd nightmares, fear of abandonment, among other things) and while i do my best to support her and help her get through the hard times it is becoming increasingly difficult. It severely affects her mood to the point of ruining her day or making her depressed for hours on end and i feel as though it is starting to affect me.

I am a very caring individual and i deeply love her and wish she didn’t struggle with these things, but at the same time it feels like I cannot talk about us and more serious topics, or even vent about my own issues and concerns in life. I am trying to help her with coping mechanisms that have helped me in the past with some of my issues but it seems like she would rather just push her problems to the side/bottle them up instead of trying to work through them. I am not a therapist/counselor and she really needs one.

I want us to be able to build the life together we want but it’s starting to feel as though that may not be the case and my fear is in the future when/if we have kids how much of it will spill out onto them.

I want to be hurt.,1,1.0,2024-06-12 17:49:25,"Just general TW overall I think?

I (16) want to be hurt/ill. I think about it constantly, I've dreamt about certain scenarios, I make up scenarios in my head all the time.

I am fully aware that this isn't healthy, but I so desperately want it that I can't stop thinking about it. Though I don't think I'd ever act on any thoughts to deliberately put myself in serious harms way.

From what I can remember, I've always been this way, as a child I drew scenes in hospitals (though I'd never been in one. I've never been seriously ill or even broken a bone or sprained anything.). For most of my childhood whenever I'd go to sleep I'd lay and think about and make up scenarios about me breaking bones, and as I've grown up this had continued into serious injuries and illnesses. Though I've never told anyone about this, but the recent year or so the thoughts have gotten worse,  and to say the least I have planned ways to break my own limbs just incase.

Currently, I use Character AI to role play scenarios where I get hurt/ill, and have been using since the beginning of this year, before and still I look at pictures of ill and hurt people (possibly a bit disrespectful ik) and imagine myself there. It's everything from something like Anemia (which I hope to get somewhat, I know it sounds bad), to brain injuries, stroke, breaking bones, amputation, paraplegic, quadriplegic, being inconticent, even stuff that I can't get because you have to be born with it, etc.

 Though I must note I mostly only do roleplay the real serious stuff in the moment just to imagine being there, not fully wanting it. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose maybe my sight or hearing or speech. I don't exactly want to have a stroke, you get it. I just want to be hurt.. it's hard to explain. 

I have this weird feeling, whenever I do roleplays with amputation/breaking bones/paraplegic. It's a feeling in my legs really, like something is wrong. Also I almost always think about being wheelchair bound, just paraplegic... I feel like my legs aren't supposed to be healthy and something needs to be wrong. It's such a desperate thought the wheelchair thing, I don't know why I want to be wheelchair bound but I do. And the thoughts of it are constant and intense.

I know this sounds bad. And hell I can barley even imagine having to deal with some issues and/or being in pain constantly, but I enjoy pretending. Recently I've been thinking a lot about anemia, and reading a lot about it, as to how people get it and how you treat it. 

I know this isn't normal, I am very much aware. If anyone has any tips please leave any. I don't know if I should search help (I'd have to tell my parents and I don't want that).

Never being satisfied with my own handwriting - is it just a personality trait or a sign of something more serious?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 17:30:25,"I always made every effort to make my notes and homework assignments look as neat as possible, but towards the end of high school, I noticed that no matter how nicely I wrote my notes, I was never satisfied with them.

I would like to move out, I have wanted to in the past but my boyfriend who is now long distance has thrown a huge wrench into my future plans because he got a DUI last year and left the state because he diddnt wanna deal with his license being suspended so now everything’s changed.

I might not even get to do grad school still if I don’t get scholarships from the school living there. My plans are being completely rearranged and it’s making my autism go insane.

I'm starting to be depressed, I've never felt so lonely in my life, and I've felt lonely my entire life a lot, this is different. My mother is a narcissist who treats me so bad and she knows she is doing something wrong but she just doesn't wanna accept it and always makes excuses. It hurts so bad, I don't think I even love her. 

My girlfriend left me almost a month ago, she was the best person I've ever met, we (she) ended it on good terms. She said she thinks we aren't compatible and she's looking for someone else and we just don't understand each other, she felt like my mental health was too much of a burden because I had noone except her. It feels like it's all my fault even tho I know it isn't. She says that she saw how much I tried and that's why she was so sad about it. But she doesn't even understand how much I love her, she has no clue. Gosh Im embarrassed cuz I think I love her more than my own mother, maybe even my father, they have never been there for me like she has, and it's not even about what she gave, it's about her as such an innocent good person. She has such a kind soul and angelic eyes, I can't even think about her, how did this happen, why did this happen.

 I'm trying to racionalize it so much, I want to go into the past and repair everything even tho I've always been so kind to her and understanding, I poured so much of the energy into the relationship, I workout, I do thai box, I try to progres mentally and yet she doesn't want me, why doesn't she want me, I'm literally told my whole by women that I'm beautiful, I've always been understanding and good to her, I've cooked for her, I wanted to help her with everything, I cared about her more than I cared about myself (which is probably a part of the problem).

 One moment I had everything I ever had in the palm of my hand, and in a second it slipped and shattered and broke me like nothing could.

I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts, i don't know how much I can take, they are not a stranger to me, but they are not nice. Even tho I'm not gonna do it, they are coming back. I go to a therapist and even tho he's the best therapist ever, it's still so hard. I know noone is coming to save me, It has to be me, sometimes I feel like I don't even wanna save myself.

I've struggled to some extent my whole life with these things but l used to at least be able to get some things done (even some really big things/a lot of things at certain points in my life), but the last year or so I have been completely worthless.

It literally takes everything I have mentally and physically to pull myself out of bed and usually late in the morning/early afternoon. I have so many things I want to do mentally and have several journals filled to the brim with to do lists and ideas and things to remember. But I never do or remember any of them.

It's become genuinely crippling at this point. My house looks like an episode or hoarders and I've lost all will to live. I can't work. I can't accomplish tasks around the house. My family and everyone around me is so fer and annoyed and beginning to hate me. And I feel awful.

I want to do all these thinas so badly. I get frustrated and just cry and cry all the time because I feel like such a lazy loser and a failure. But I can not remember/focus on ANYTHING.


I'm just at a loss here. I don't know what is wrong or how to fix it. I have no quality of life at this point and am worthless to the world and those around me. I've tried everything I can think of and all the ""adhd focusing"" tips I've seen online. I've tried breaking things down into smaller tasks. Making to do lists with one task at a time.
Attempting to fix my sleep schedule. I've asked those around me to help keep me on track but they all have their own lives and jobs and don't have time to babysit me all day. My psych didn't listen to me at all. I'm ready to give up.

Please help and please be nice. Thanks.

How can I (forgive/redeem my sense of confidence in) myself after a mental breakdown?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 16:23:10,"So today, I woke up dead tired, and I was dreading the hw questions that I knew I could do pretty swimmingly, because there is also a paper to write. It was one of those days where I was going to need physical support to sit in class, so I brought my instrument case with me to hold my head up. My Dad, minding his own business, gets excited it, and I freak out internally, as if I'd been seen naked.

In the garage, I have to literally trudge through a trail of garbage to get to my car and drive to class. My laptop doesn't work without a mouse so I have this string to attach it to my bag. I am severely autistic, so this is necessary, as I literally get overwhelmed having to carry both of these items separately in my hands. 

The car is also full of junk because I share it. As I put my bag in the passenger seat, the battery cover pops off and falls somewhere I don't see. Mom sticks her head in, and after having to work really hard to make her leave, I go bloody ballistic. I am flopping around the car, getting my limbs caught from a combination of adrenaline and fatigue, and I repeatedly call for siri because I misplaced my phone and I can't get there without google maps. 

Accepting that I am going to be late, no big deal, I am heaving as I throw stuff out onto the floor and into the trunk. I find myself shrieking and sobbing out loud as I drive (100% safely, mind you) to the campus. 

Another time this has happened was when I was trying to watch youtube while walking on a treadmill. Usually I had very good motor skills, I played piano at one point, and both multitasking and cardio were big hobbies of mine. But that day, I tried to prop the thing up and jt fell, and (nobody was there) that was the first time I screamed out loud. As people perceive me, I worry that although I feel squashed into bottling it up, it has always made me weaker whenever let it out.

I really desperately need some form of practice or progressable advice, because I will just randomly have very vulnerably low mental stamina. You can think of it as a crippled ability to get comfortable. My family can and has eaten away at crucial battles in my time management and self worth. On a bad day, my brain just won't work if I don't lay down or prop myself up in some way.

I used to ask him for dating advice since I am very awkward when it comes to dating and expressing my feelings. Then he started to hangout with us. But after some time I noticed some changes , he started to get a little clingy and playful with her . I didn't really thought much about it as it was something he normally does around girls and it wasn't much at the time. But eventually These things just increased and her behaviour changed , when he was around compared to when I was.

Do I have an ED?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 15:16:43,"I(18F) used to have no problem with food. It was just part of life and I really plaid no attention to it, until I hit around 14yo. 
-
My Mom had got a new husband and spent literally all her time with him in his room. She almost completely stopped cooking and left me, my 13yo sister, my 12yo sister and my 9yo brother to fend for ourselves. After a while of being hungry, took it upon myself to learn how to cook from online, with the first thing I ever learned to make being scrambled eggs. I don't know why, but everytime someone would walk into the kitchen or watch me cook, I got a little nervous, but it never affected anything and I'd continue what I was doing, but it always makes me want them to leave. I went on like this for a few years, but I was slowly getting more and more anxious when someone was in the kitchen with me. I also started to prefer to eat alone.
It went on like that for a little while, until these last couple of years. 
-
Now, whenever I cook and someone walks into the kitchen, I just stop what I'm doing and kinda cower down until they leave. I get super anxious when someone is close and especially embarrassed and upset when someone looks at my food. And I CANNOT eat in front of people. I just can't, no matter how much I want the food or whatever, I just can't. I also eat like 20 times a day, and I'm not talking snacks, I mean damn near full course meals! I eat even more when upset. I can eat till my stomach hurts and is about to burst, but then I'm hungry again like 20 minutes later. My stomach will feel like it did before eating and I get pekish. I Also can't stop myself when I get going. Like if I'm eating a bag of chips and I'm told to save some for another day, once I start eating them, I cannot stop and keep eating until they are gone. Doing this has actually gotten me into trouble acouple times.
I always feel bad about eating so much, but I can't help myself, it doesn't stop.
-
But the weirdest thing is currently happening. About five days ago, I moved in with some family. They are all super nice and constantly offer me food, but I refuse. I haven't eaten since I've got here. I'm starving and want food, but I just can't bring myself to eat here. They tell me to make myself at home and get any food I want, but I just can't. The most I get is a bottle of water from the kitchen before scurrying back to the room I'm staying in. I've never gone this long without food, and it feels so weird. My Aunt has even pointed out that I'm losing weight(I was 190 before I moved here) and have no clue how much I weigh now, but I don't see a difference. But then again, I constantly see myself different everyday and my body shape is different Everytime I look, so I don't know.

I got out of a bad relationship with one of my oldest friends so yeah that does take a toll on me but I just don't know what to do. I'm very privileged and blessed to have a good environment at home and nice friends but none of that really matters anymore.

Sometimes due to some reason I'm afraid to sleep at night, I have to literally exhaust myself to do so. But if I'm sharing a bed with someone it helps me to sleep.

I still miss my ex ngl but it's not like he's on my mind 24/7 or that I still pine for him. I've moved on to a very great extent by now. 

I just don't wanna feel like this anymore, I wanna be happy and for once not have any bad and anxious thought in my mind. ",mentalhealth,ilovedogmemes2,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de87cc/am_i_suffering_from_depression/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06

Obsessions and scary thoughts,1,1.0,2024-06-12 14:20:27,"Hello.  I am worried and SCARED of myself, I might say.  I have a bizarre behavior.  I also went to the school psychologist, but it didn't help.  I've always been told that I'm weird, that I'm cringe, or that I'm childish or girly.  I always get criticized, but I don't know if what I said before is relevant. Sometimes I feel used and betrayed.  What SCARED me is that I'm daydreaming, so to speak.  I was OBSESSED with one song for 3 years.  I listened to it day and night, every day, I listened to it slowed down, I listened to it at high speed, covers, etc., I became obsessed with that song.  Since I was a child, I used to imagine if I was in the place of other cartoon characters and I would make scenarios in my head what I would do if.  And in the evening, I think from the age of 8-9-10, even before I went to bed, I imagined something to fall asleep.  Now, going back to the song, I always had scenarios if it was me singing it, if it was me in the video, if I was famous.  I kind of like being the center of attention, or that's what I'd like, although I can't stand talking to the world, because I find it boring and I don't understand their gestures.  The phase is that I found something on the net about maladaptivebdrreaming or dat dreaming and I found myself, but I don't understand why I obsess.  I, for example, in grades 5-8, had an obsession with the color gray and all my clothes were gray.  I obsess over different people, objects, things, drawings, etc.  I make scenarios, when I was little, I would lay in bed, look at the ceiling and imagine and even wave my hands.  I've noticed that I've developed an obsession with psychological anime and I admire psychopathic characters.  Please, I don't know if it falls into this category.  I feel like something is wrong with me and I can't even explain it, I can't make myself understood.  I call for help and no one hears me.  I am AWARE that something is wrong with me and I continue to live.  Sometimes I make scenarios if I kill myself, I even thought about killing myself until a child died on the street and I saw how much pain it caused the family and how the village started talking.  I need help but no one is here for me.  I found so many things on the net about being a psychopath, sociopath, ADHD, OCD, personality disorders, anxiety, etc.  But I can't make a diagnosis myself, although I have moments when I check 4-5 times in a row if I closed the door, put my glasses in the case or to check if someone is home, if I'm really alone.  I don't think I managed to cover everything I want to say and what is pressing me.  I can't say what thoughts I had cuz this post will be long , frankly, scary.  I fear.

I have no idea what to address first with my psychiatry assessment next month. Depression/intrusive thoughts/substance abuse/A(u)DHD,1,1.0,2024-06-12 14:13:51,"(using my throwaway account here for anonymity)

Hi there, 

I'm m/26 and I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for at least 14 years and living in Germany. 

I've been thrice to psychologists and psychiatrists (2019, 2022 and 2024) but most of them didn't seem to be of huge help. The only thing I've actually got from all those visits is that I was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, which is so far unmedicated. Also low-support need autism is running in our family's genes and I show tons of traits, but I don't want a diagnosis for this. 

The next assessment with a new psychiatrist is set in early July, but I hope to move it into June, because I'm really falling apart currently. In the beginning I had only set the appointment to medicate my ADHD, but as you'll read further there's a couple of more issues that really need to be addressed.

After a breakup from a three year relationship in February I fell into a deep hole again with returning suicidal thoughts, abuse of alcohol, reckless driving and intrusive thoughts (offending and sexually abusing others, self harm, suicide). Especially the mentioned intrusive thoughts are eating me up and I'm utterly disgusted by them, because I know that they are bullshit and would only harm other people. 

After nearly half a year I can say that I got mostly over the heartbreak, but the depression, the unmedicated ADHD and those nasty intrusive thoughts are eating me up.

I'm at a point where I can still handle everything, like I'll only drink too much if I have the next day off and also I wouldn't get in my car after drinking, but I have no idea for how long I can handle this. 

To my further situation, I've got a stable job in our public healthcare system, I'm living on my own with my cat and I've got a couple of friends I can call and visit on regular basis, but I avoid to do so because I don't really want to be burden to them or my mother. 
Also I'd consider myself compliant and self-aware enough to be left unsupervised without harming myself or others, so I'd actually prefer to do a therapy in our day clinic nearby. 

What should I address first? Even as a medical professional I couldn't tell for myself which problem has to be fixed first.

Thank you!

Failed to get into a good University ,1,1.0,2024-06-12 13:10:48,"I finished my bachelor's a year ago and took a gap year because I didn't plan out what I wanted to do. I had just cruised through life up until then fighting some major anxiety and minor depression and in my year off I decided I had to study for this national competitive exam in an effort to at least try and go somewhere prestigious for my masters. 

Except couldn't find it in me to study as much as I needed to. I only did like a month of actual prep. I managed to clear the exam, with a really bad rank (1922 out of ~14300). And it isn't good enough to get into one of the Good  Universities ™ in my country (I've already got rejected from quite a few of them).

Which means there's a very high likelihood that I'll have to go back to the uni I did my bachelor's in to get an MSc. And I'm dreading it so badly because my professors there (while reasonable people) have been making snide comments about how I wasn't good enough to go anywhere else and how I should have just come back instead of wasting a year. 

My parents are disappointed in me too. I made them spend money unnecessarily. And I feel so useless because of all of this. 

I keep thinking about how I should have just gone back to the same uni in the first place. At least then in another year I'd have a job and be able to pull my weight in the house. Or if I choose to take a year off, I should've studied harder, but instead I could barely get out of bed at all. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. Why can I not stop scrolling through Instagram even though I need to. Like I'm not even enjoying the reels I'm watching, but I feel so stuck. And now it feels like any progress I made to get over how much I hate myself has completely vanished. 

I just don't know how to change. I feel stuck and in a haze all the time and I don't know what I'm doing with my life.

"2 voices in head, one is really demeaning. How to stop letting it influence me as much? ",2,1.0,2024-06-12 08:57:29,"It's been going on for a while but I have this thing where whenever I think/ do one thing, a voice inside my head criticizes me. Its pretty easy to just ignore but I do think it has affected how i express myself. It's going as I make this post right now and saying that I'm stupid for going onto reddit as if I genuinely have a problem. Please don't shame me if this is just something normal ! sorry the post is long! 

  
BTW, the voice doesn't refer to me as ""you,"" the voice is me, so for example if I'm thinking ""Wow I am so happy"" the second voice goes ""why am I so happy it really isnt that exciting""

**tldr; second voice that always humbles me and downplays my feelings so I start to believe events/feelings are not that serious.**

  
I think it might just be intrusive thoughts, but it's a little different than that. The intrusive thought affects the main voice, and then the second voice is the one that says that I'm a cornball idiot for thinking like that. So its good and bad in a way, but really only has affected me negatively



Whenever something bad happens to me, I begin to pity myself or say that I have terrible luck etc. The second voice tells myself that I'm acting stupid or that whatever happened isn't a big deal and that I'm overreacting. Same thing whenever something good happens and I'm excited, but the voice says that its not that exciting or that things are going to go bad and it won't last long

  
I am really insecure about my body and face, so sometimes I look into the mirror and just stare at my self. If i call myself ugly, the other voice doesn't speak. 

However, if I question if I have some kind of dysmorphia the voice says that its not that serious and that I'm just trying to convince myself that somethings wrong with me. I try to stare for barely 10 seconds but the whole time i'm doing that the voice says I'm being corny so i immediately feel ashamed and stop



I feel like my body is terrible (which im trying to fix) because I barely can eat 1 meal and have motivation to do things yet can never get my body to move. I genuinely wonder what is up with my body but once again the second voice just says nothing is wrong with me and that I want a reason to pity myself.

  
is the voice itself normal? i can survive fine with the voice, the health and insecurity is its own problem. 

It basically just keeps me neutral and self aware, but I think I've had a tough time trying to express myself because of this. I haven't told my parents how my body feels and always aches and how I want to wake up early but I cant, etc. I cringe at the thought of going up to my family and talking about myself as if i WANT them to tell me that im not ok ",mentalhealth,overweight_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de223c/2_voices_in_head_one_is_really_demeaning_how_to/,0,2.0,0.0,4.26823282356406e-06
Any mental health conditions similar to my ME/CFS crashes?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 12:42:30,"Please note I do not self harm or plan to. But I did mention ‘suicidal thoughts’ which is why I tagged it. 

I would love to see a psychiatrist one day to explore what other conditions my ME/CFS (chronic fatigue) crashes may overlap with. I thought I might post on here and see if any non-MECFS folk have similar experiences due to other conditions.

My biggest question is around conditions that can cause a quick onslaught of extreme negative emotions and thoughts, ones that are not consistent with your mental state outside of the experience. Ones that may be associated with sensory sensitivities and loss of body movement. 

My experience during my crashes:

A crash will usually be triggered by too much noise and light stimulation, stress, or over exertion of my energy.

I can feel it coming on as I become light and noise sensitive, and I start to lose movement in my body. I’ll need to lay in my bed in complete darkness with earplugs. At the same time as these sensory sensitivities I have an intense emotional reaction. My heart is racing, with crippling anxiety, but at the same time it’s like I’ve been injected with a depressive drug that makes the whole world in slow motion, and it brings up extreme levels of depression, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. 

It’s strange though because I have a full mental awareness of these thoughts and feelings. I can observe them come in and out alongside the other symptoms. I know I would never act on them but they feel very real. 

The experience will last anywhere from 1-3+ hours where I just remain in the dark with no noise until I start to come out of it. I can never fall asleep due to the high levels of anxiety. Though I wish I could. 

Once I come out of the crash I can monitor that the sensory sensitivities, negative emotions and ability to talk and move all improve together.

I’m then left in a kind of hungover state for a few days where my fatigue is worse, a little sad. But nothing like in the crash. It’s a very separate experience. Almost like the fatigue shuts down an area in my brain responsible for controlling and keeping in check every fear in my psyche or something. 

Also kind of feels like a bad drug trip or something. Honestly, terrifying. ",mentalhealth,bed-is-life,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de5pqn/any_mental_health_conditions_similar_to_my_mecfs/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06

My problem is not my interactions with him anymore because my last message to him were ""I know you gave up on us because there is another person"" and I completely blocked him everywhere and disappeared from his life, even deleted all my social media so he'll never find me again. I don't know if he'll ever care one day but I don't want anything related to him anymore.

My problem is something inside me, my thoughts. I am realizing than when I wake up, the thing he did to me is the first thing I think about. During the day, I am wondering if he'll ever regret what he did. And my mind is just full of him and I don't know what to do. I try to live my life, focus on it, but I just end up thinking about it everytime. I would just like to erase it from my brain completely. But it's not easy, I feel like I am really, really hurt by what happened. I don't want him anymore and I would like to meet another person, but I just want to leave this toxicity of thinking about him everytime because it's eating me alive. I feel like it's a form of self-harm I am inflicting to myself, like an addiction of thinking pattern that I can't get rid off. And it's really affecting my mental health.

school is ruining my mental health and i need advice because im lost,1,1.0,2024-06-12 12:07:43,"Im a girl in middle school and i have pretty bad mental health. Last year i was rlly struggling  ive relapsed. My teacher for science and homeroom is this old guy who is the worst teacher i've ever met. He is rude, disrespectful, and a terrible teacher. I wont go into detail cause thats a looong rant but seriously, he should not have this job. Because hes been assigniing so much work and frustrating me so much, its affected my other schoolwork and is putting be behind where i like to be, which is super stressful. Also, my spanish class is terrible; i have no friends, we have a test every week, we get taught nothing, etc. Almost every lesson is like this. Plus, all seven of my subjects have 2 assignments due really soon that i have no time or motivation to do. Since these things are really frustrating me and stressing me out, i've been losing myself. I've been screaming at my brother over nothing, wasting away in my room, crying nightly, not eating or sleeping. It sucks. And when i go to school i instantly get panicked. Its the worst place. The noises are too loud, people are touching me, my uniform is uncomfortable, im tired, the lights are bright, people are looking at me, and im stressed about each lesson. Recently, i skipped a spanish lesson to sit in the library and do my work. I skipped class to do my work. and then i obviously got caught and in trouble and i have a community service. Community services are these dumb things we have instead of detention where you spend all recess walking around picking up rubbish. Normally this would be fine. But you wear a hi-vis vest. People look at you. Its scary. I tried explaining this to the coordinator who gave me the community service but he didnt listen. That same day i got a behaviour report because I called my science teacher a bad teacher and said i should be allowed to go to the toilet when i need to. Since then I havent said a word to anyone. I wont speak. I dont know why. I have lots of reasons that all work, but the main thing is i just wont talk. Everything makes my blood boil. I either feel nothing, sad, or pure anger. When i get angry, i used to scream, but now i just hit myself on walls. everything i love is too hard. I feel so useless. Every night i sit in the dark, trying to sleep but never being able to and the same thought keeps coming back. ""you were such a smiley, smart, sweet little girl. where did she go? now you dont even try. you had so much potential and now you're what everyone knew you'd become. A cruel mess.""

My mum's mental health is destroying me,1,0.99,2024-06-12 12:04:03,"My mum has struggled with mental health issues pretty much her entire life. Ever since she got divorced with my Dad in 2003, there was a three-year period where everything was okay. She used to clash with my sister quite a lot for over 18 years since she met her current partner and this soon stopped when she moved down south in the UK in 2021. She takes care of her mother full time and is also a full time carer. She cries pretty much every time I go and see her and won't seek any help due to family disputes and financial issues.

I almost feel like I've been around family members arguing my entire life and have never known anything different. But it's gotten to a stage now where I feel like I've had enough, I'm filled with anger all of the time and feel incapable of crying as I've trained myself so well to bottle up my emotions. It's got so bad that I feel like I can't even go out and meet a woman of my own due to how I'm feeling. I've been single for 4 years and don't know how to deal with simple things like arguments or disagreements anymore. I live by myself and suffer with immense loneliness. 

My mum only has me that lives nearby and no-one else. I've put off going to work in London due to the immense guilt that I feel on a daily basis that I'm unable to help her with her problems. She won't seek professional help, she doesn't want a partner, she won't get a new job, she won't downsize her home to save money.

I lie to myself so much I dont know what’s real anymore,1,1.0,2024-06-12 11:31:10,"
hi reddit, I lowkey hate asking for opinions or advice, but I have no sources irl to go to about this and I just feel very lost. ever since turning 21 this past year, I have had numerous breakdowns because I feel that I dont know myself. everything I have ever known over the years whether it be my opinions, interest, feelings, etc. doesn’t feel like my OWN opinions.. like im lying to myself but say, think, and do these things for the validation for everyone else around me.
i’ve been reflecting a lot on my childhood and teenage years and realized almost everything I “loved” and worked towards was for my parents to be proud of me and for my peers to be impressed by me. I have stuck to these things for years and “perfected” them, but I feel so bored of it all but I constantly told myself I love it. now, it feels like maybe I hate those things but I also cannot imagine myself discarding and not doing those things.. so if I dont want to let go, do I love it?

overall, I feel like the hugest liar. i wonder if im lying to everyone and if I am lying to myself. I dont know myself and dont know how to get to know myself without the lies and constant need for validation.  this constant way of thinking is driving me crazy because I cannot stand being around me or anyone anymore so I sleep all the time to avoid thinking like this and feeling like every time I open my mouth to someone, im lying to them for their approval of me and using that to validate myself. I simply dont trust myself. 
I wish to feel so sure in myself that I KNOW what I like for ME, have opinions for MYSELF, and live for myself. but I am so confused with myself I just wanna ditch me and everything. not wanting to die but.. not deal with me. idk. have any of you gone through this? or understand what I am trying to say?

When I put myself in conversations with them I hold my opinions and reactions, I won't talk to keep the conversation going, simply because I end up feeling without energy to even try. When people flirt with me I shut them down, I tell them I'm not interested and if they insist I end up not responding after a few days.

If I'm lucky enough to have people interested in continuing to talk I show the worst in myself, my insecurities, my biases, my unpopular opinions, just trying to have them stop thinking highly of me.

I have a hard time trusting people and I make the effort but it's very easy to lose my trust and they notice I don't trust them enough so.. yeah.

When I get attached to people I end up being very needy and.. that pushes them away

All the time there is fear involved and I make people drift away from me.

I do all of these when I try to protect myself and a lot of the times I'm also thinking: ""I don't want you to get too close and get hurt by me"", ""I'm too toxic for anyone to get anything good out of being in my company"" ""it's better when I'm alone""

Right now my life has gotten so bad like i have literally no one to talk to or even ask for advice. I have gotten ugly as well like my eyes are dry, i got hairloss and i don't eat and sleep on time. This all happened after i came to a foreign country to study in 2022. Before this i was so healthy and i didn't even know about reddit and i used to be very active like i had many hobbies and i didn't have any struggle. so now when looking back, it feels impossible to go back to the old me. This all started after i had a friend group in university and they never liked me for idk what reason but they did use my stuff . and when i had a bf because i was so lonely (which was a bad idea) those friends acted even more bad mean towards me ...so at the end they bullied me and kicked me out of the group and even the teacher didn't like me ..i don't understand why wore the teacher so invested that i had a bf and then after few months even that guy cheated and turns out he had 3 other side gf after i was at my lowest point. i felt so betrayed and embarrased. also being an asian. this was the first time i let my family know about him and now since he's gone...it's so awkward to talk to my family...and my sister they support me financially since i study medicine and now they don't want to talk with me in video call because i've become ugly and they cut the phone if i complain and they say my voice is so annoying . i don't even like to hear my own voice. i want to kms sometimes but then again i have so many haters and i don't want them to give the satisfaction. right now i feel so hopeless, nothing excites me and i can't even go to therapy because my pocket money is tight and i don't like to go outside because i've become so ugly .....and my life got worse worse every day so i don't know how will i be abel to handle living forward like god i just want a peaceful life with good people...i didn't do anything wrong ..not wish bad on anyone but why meee :( 

also my ex was very rich so he looked down on me but he used my money and was very cheap..i feel so small now..he's living his life with that new girl and im stuck in my room

There's a girl, Maddi. We dated when we were super young and it didn't work. Maddi got with Bob and had a kid.

Fast forward 10 years and Maddi and I are best friends.
Maddi left the guy due to serious Family Domestic Violance.

I have been her rock. How we are both being single, we have been more and more affectionate with each other.
Holding hands, cuddles while watching movies, sleeping in the same bed and spooning.
No sex or kissing.

While all this is happening she has been talking to Mark from Tinder Mark lives 4 hours away from Maddi and they made a plan to spend 4 days in Maddi's town to see Maddi.

I have now developed strong feelings and confessed them to Maddi. Maddi said that ""things have changed"" for her too and asked what i wanted. I said thay we both delete the apps, say goodbye anyone else who is a romantic/sexual option and give ""us"" a go.

She said she isn't sure and want to talk over dinner (the 17th June). She did say that that i can consider all her dating apps deleted. I asked her about ""us"" later and said i needed an answer because waiting is making me crazy. Maddi said that she wants to clear up some thing is thats worrying her (like ruining out friendship, her kid, and stuff) and just wants to be sure.

I feel so anxious and i also have so much guilt that my anxiety can't help me trust her. But should intrust her. But then again, if she is single right now, I have no business to know anything about her private life.

I hate that I confessed my feelings and Maddi will likely stop talking to Mark (or do it in secret).

I'm very lonely yet I push everyone away and don't want anyone near me,1,1.0,2024-06-12 07:46:58,"Late 20s. Struggled with depression for at least 11 years and I'm in a dark place.

I don't have any friends (my contacts are literally my parents and my brother), never any serious relationships, no acquaintances, never worked a proper job. I used to have internet friends though they either disappeared or I pushed them away. I had friends as a child though I became depressed and then when school ended they disappeared.

I have ALWAYS wanted friends and a relationship. I yearn for people to play games with, to be in a group chat with and to hang out with, and I yearn for intimacy and cuddles.

However, as soon as any opportunity for these two things this arise, I immediately feel awful. I literally never want them to talk to me again or come near me again. Nothing bad happens, there's no 'incident' - I feel immense guilt, shame, fear, anxiety. I will literally shiver and shake. I try and do as much deep breathing as I can over and over again and continuously reassure myself with calm and positive affirmations etc. and it does literally nothing.

Even the other day I tried to find an internet friend to game with through an app. Someone messaged me and they looked like the sort of person I'm looking for, and I immediately went into meltdown and 30 minutes later deleted everything. And this was for someone on the other side of the world who only said ""hey :)""....

I don't get it. It ruins me. It's stopping me from making any connections and it scares me how extreme it feels - it's not just a bit of worry, it controls me and overwhelms me, I freeze solid.

11 years of seeing therapists and trying all sorts of medications, plus doing my own research, has yielded no answers or solutions.

This means that I've stopped trying. I don't try and seek out things, I simply try and accept it... thus I'm very lonely and if I stopped going to the gym I would be almost completely isolated.

I kinda suck,1,1.0,2024-06-12 07:40:23,"
I dont have the right to be upset. I’m the cause of most of my problems . I don’t know how to communicate to people properly. How I am feelings is difficult for me to put into words when it’s really the most important. I don’t know how to fix myself. I am tired of messing up. I’m tired of bringing people down with me because I can’t figure myself out. I would be better off not in this world. It would’ve been better if I had never existed. My chest hurts. My throat hurts too. I hate feeling like this. Little things get to me so easily. I must suck to be around. That’s why people don’t want to talk to me. I probably seem unwelcoming. I never know what to say. I always feel like people dislike me but it’s probably just in my head. Maybe I’m not pretty enough to be approached, I know outward appearance also matters. I hate seeing myself in the mirror. I’m so ugly. Without makeup or my hair done I’m hideous. Maybe that is also what makes me unappealing and unapproachable. If I wasn’t so scared of dying I would kill myself but I’m too scared to. I feel so disconnected from everyone around me. All I do is cause problems for people. I have very little to bring to society and to other people’s lives. I’m a burden. I hate that people do things for me. I wish I had a career so I could just move out. I wish I could move far away. I wish I had someone I felt truly connected to. I feel so lonely all the time. I can never do anything right. What do I live for that’s actually valuable? I am no one’s #1. But I don’t have to be. But I want to be. I want so badly to be close to people but it’s so difficult for me. I wish I could explain my feelings better to people. I wish little things didn’t bother me. I wish I wasn’t emotional. I wish I couldn’t feel things because then I wouldnt react the way I react. I’m tired of working and I’m tired of school. I’m tired of always having to rely on someone. I’m tired of acting like a child. But I have childlike emotions and actions. I wasn’t like that before. Only now that I’m an adult, I’m here feeling and acting like a child. I am turning 19 in a month. I don’t want to be an adult. I’m so scared. There is something wrong with me. I’m not normal. I don’t want to live with my mom or my dad. They are divorced. I hate my mom, but I want so badly to not hate her. I always come back to her. And always ends badly. But I love her and I want so badly to have a good relationship with her. I feel so out of places at my dads. I love my dad so much. But my mom always tell me how he never did anything for me, he never cared. I can’t do this anymore. But I don’t to live alone. I can’t live alone. So what do I do? I’d rather die. I can’t do it anymore. I feel like I’m falling apart. Why do I do the things that I do, why do I act the way that I act. I wish I knew why I respond to things the way i respond. I wish I wasn’t a loser. But in the end it’s still my fault. I could’ve made different choices and I could I have done different things. So what right do I have to sit and cry. It’s my fault. But I hate self pity. And I feel stupid everytime I think about these things, and so I push them down. Because I think this is self pity. But this is how I feel. So I feel like I shouldn’t feel like this, it’s not okay. My head hurts really bad. I suck. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I want anymore.

She’s against me taking any type of medication which is why I’m hesitant to ask for help because I feel like she will be disappointed.

Being overly emotional and just exhausted ,1,1.0,2024-06-12 06:41:38,"  Hello! I don't really post at all on Reddit, mainly just lurking on occasion. Forgive me if my formatting is odd, this is my first post. Just wanted to see if I wasn't alone on this, but I find myself to be a really emotional person and highly sensitive to certain topics.
  First thing that comes to mind if whenever I do end up talking about my own experiences or personal thoughts, I end up crying. This has happened every time I've tried bringing up my own mental health with my mother (to no avail, my aunt is helping me get in touch with a therapist, so yippee!) And I always seem to end up in tears. Another incident that was similar was when I confined in my school counselor about my worries about not being able to graduate in time and I was barely holding back tears at the thought of having to tell my parents about it. But, when she [my school counselor] gave me support. OPEN THE FLOODGATES! I guess it's just a lot of touchy stuff, but if anyone has any tips on maybe keeping these tears in? I feel like it really doesn't help my case with my mother, if her daughter is telling her stuff through tears and hiccups.
  In the case for the exhaustion, I just can't find myself to have any energy throughout the day. Barely enough to send my friends or my girlfriend a message to response to her goodmornings. I'm thankful that she's understanding of what's going on with me and my headspace. I've always had speculations, but could this be the long term effects of depression? I'd say I've been struggling with depression since I was in middle school, but only during high-school and now that I've out I think it's gotten worse. Any tips to deal with the mental fog?
  Also I do have thoughts that I might be suffering from other things (ie ADHD, autism) how would I exactly bring that up with my therapist? I would be more than willing to do testing, what worries me are how my parents will react if I turn up with something. (For context: both my parents are Asian and both don't think really highly of mental disorders/illnesses. I catch enough flak for having anxiety.)

I recently got in contact with a psychologist in my area to seek out a psychological examination. I figured this would be the first step for my issues. At first I was told that insurance authorized the service and were going to cover a bit of the cost. Which was fine at the time, I would barely be able to afford it. Today however, I received word from the doctor that now they're not going to authorize the service and I will have to pay the full cost if I want the evaluation. They explained that if I am able to meet with a neurologist prior and get a referral, we can then move forward. With insurance.

I'm not too sure how to navigate this situation. Can anybody provide some insight?

Advice before I let my eating disorder ruin my life for good. ,1,1.0,2024-06-12 05:35:25,"I've been battling an eating disorder for about a year (became really perfectionistic about counting calories to the extreme), and it's about to ruin my life for good. During the last fall semester of freshman year in college I got anorexia due to injuring my wrist and hip and being unable to do any exercise but walking, and got even more paranoid about getting fat. That turned into binge eating constantly, and I managed to barely survive this semester. Throughout this time, I've gotten therapy sometimes multiple times a week, had so much help from my parents (emotional and financially; they've been incredibly supportive and spent so much money trying to help me). I've met with a nutritionist, I've gotten rid of food content for some time, stopped driving myself, and done tons of self reflection. I've even been doing self hypnosis. I've read every self discipline advice and have lots of knowledge, but in the end it can't seem to help me. Finally, my leg hip injury still bothers me considerably and hasn't seemed to really improve.

However, the food thoughts haven't gone away. I have a decent body fat percentage (though my parents say I look fine) and need to lose this weight fast before school starts in 2 months. I'm on an ROTC scholarship and need to have this taken care of by then, it seriously disrupted that. I am getting back from a 2 week trip to Japan with my Dad, and realized that the calories added up regardless and I allowed myself to overeat/binge at breakfast and lunch buffets today, because I wasn't feeling ""in it"" and was just thinking about food so much, and because I feel like I really failed (my chest fat is unbearable and it'll take a good bit more time to get rid of; haven't made any real progress). I already have plans of binging when I get back.

I feel pretty bad about this, but nothing seems to work for good. The thoughts are too strong, and I'm tired of feeling decent (or even just in control despite strong urges, or having it be tough but manageable). I was supposed to not eat lunch today but the hunger pang was too strong. My injuries aren't healed nor is my digestion, and since my weight has stagnated I'm not in a great places for fall. I guess I have to drop everything I've worked hard for because I need to binge.

I hated growing up in my rich family,2,0.63,2024-06-12 00:02:36,"I grew up in a very wealthy family, and I hated it. Before I say anything, I want to clarify: I acknowledge the privilege and benefits that come with money. I'm grateful for the comfort my parents provided, and I'm not taking anything for granted, including having a roof over my head, good healthcare, and education. I also understand that one can experience poverty and have abusive parents simultaneously, and money didn’t cause my parents to be the way they are. I just want to make this clear so I don’t seem like a spoiled brat.

The reason I want to share this is that I’ve never felt I could talk about my financial background without being judged. Maybe this will help.

My parents built their fortune from the ground up, coming from poor backgrounds to owning a successful healthcare clinic chain. Since I was a baby, they wanted me to take over the family business and study law, economics, or medicine. They wanted the best for me, but I never had any interest in taking over the business. I have ADHD, I'm terrible with numbers and organizing, and I hate nepotism. I believe many others could do a better job than me.

I always felt that the business and money were more important than me. My parents were only concerned about my academic performance and didn't care about how I felt. They would get mad if I spent time with friends or pursued my passion for dancing, seeing these activities as a waste of time. They worked long hours and had a terrible relationship with each other. I made it clear from age 12 that I had no interest in the business, pursued a degree in marketing, worked as a barista, and now work in a marketing agency while trying to dance professionally.

Since childhood, my parents told me I was a failure and should be embarrassed by my lack of achievements. They constantly reminded me that I would be nothing without them. Money ruined my childhood. I grew up with babysitters, as my parents were always working, and they were verbally abusive and controlling. I had issues with self-harm from the age of 6. 

It confuses me when people find out who my parents are and tell me how lucky I am. Even if I shared my background, I always felt labeled as ""the rich kid.""

Am I Less of A Man??,1,0.67,2024-06-12 03:33:42,"Hi idk if this is the proper place to talk about this but I'm gonna post it anyway. 

So I've been broken up with for over a year now and my ex is with a guy who she has now dated longer than I have and he recently graduated from community college a few weeks ago in carpentry. He already has his own business on Facebook has done a few jobs already.

I however graduated from the same community college a year ago in business administration and have been working in my towns hospital for almost a year now. I work in the admitting department, answering calls talking face to face with people answering their questions and telling them where to go for certain things, all that stuff. 

So I'm just wondering, am I less of a man as someone who is in carpentry? Should I have pursued that career instead? Would I never find someone because I'm not in a ""manly"" career? 

I'm hoping some of you can help me out as I am heavily second guessing myself on everything now. And if u have any other questions for me I'd be happy to answer to the best of my ability.

After the panic attack I started to feel fuzzy like life doesn’t seem real and had sad thoughts about death. I coped for a while then decided to try meds so I  got on lexapro. I was on it for a year and honestly it helped! But I gained 30 pounds and decided to give it up.

I feel like I’m going insane,2,1.0,2024-06-11 22:11:02,"Hello, I just need to vent about this because it’s genuinely driving me insane and I don’t know what to do about it. 

So I, M19, am in university and I am in private halls. I have one friend who is also M19 and in my halls. Since I met him everything about me has crashed to the ground, along with the change from living at home to living at university.  He is important to me but I don’t think I’m important to him.  I have felt drawn to him since the start, but that has manifested in such ways that are unlike me. For instance, my brain memorised the sounds of everyone’s door so that I could recognise when he would come out his room, and then I would follow him out, which I didn’t want to do but it felt like I had to, like I couldn’t control it.  When he would socialise with others and not with me, I would lose it and cry and get so paranoid, then be so exhausted that I couldn’t get out of bed the next day. I have sought professional help, and it has helped, but the feelings haven’t gone away.  I’m able to control myself more and not follow him around, but I still get paranoid when he hangs out with others, although the paranoia is much more short lived now. It still distresses me though, and as I have been placed in halls next year it is making me fearful of socialising with the new people in case I start acting the same way, and I really don’t want to do that because it just pushes people away.   My emotions would cycle rather viciously each day at the start of the year, and whilst I have more of a handle on them now, I still have outbursts. I’m able to redirect most emotions, but I’m just so tired of doing this.

Am I different?,2,0.76,2024-06-11 21:43:15,"I'm a 20/F and I wrote this list of weird things about me at 1 am (Which may also indicate something). And I feel like it would be nice to get an outside perspective on this, because I think it might impact my social life and I need to see if anyone else feels like me. I didn't find any other subreddits where this would fit better on so I'm just posting it here.

 • I often zone out in group conversations or when people have a lot to say to me. Words go in one ear and straight out the other. And sometimes I can nod and say yes even if I don't hear what is being said. Because I say it on autopilot. I know this sounds kinda selfish but I really don't do it on purpose.

• This zoning out also affects other areas, like when I'm watching a movie.

• I currently have an imaginary boyfriend - as a 20-year-old... His nationality keeps changing now and then.

 • I sometimes have extreme obsessions with characters from movies.  When I was in middle school, I was very fascinated by the raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy.  I daydreamed that I was a talking raccoon in a universe inhabited by multiple species and in the same situation as him. Maybe I could relate a little to his mental problems. Or maybe I just wanted to relate so I could justify my struggles or something. 

 • I forget completely basic things such as locking the door before I leave the house or taking my car keys and phone with me. Although I try to remember it.

 • Sometimes I can sit in a chair or wander around the house for hours on end while daydreaming about various things.  I can have an imaginary debate, imagine myself as an actor in an imaginary movie, imagine myself in a possible or impossible future job or think about some imaginary boyfriend and what our relationship would have been like.

• I think way too much about philosophical questions to the point where reality breaks. And I can't stop. All kinds of sensations lose its meaning because I know my brain is just making it up and if there were no humans, the universe wouldn't exist as we know it. And all kinds of concepts lose its meaning too because they're just built on other concepts which are again built on other concepts and everything is just energy but what's energy and it all started at the big bang but what created the big bang and so on.. I could go on forever about this. And I feel like it prevents me from enjoying the moment.

I don't think I have autism because I generally understand social contexts. Even tho I know  some of this can sound kind of autistic. I think I might have inattentive ADHD tho. But I haven't checked for it. Besides, I don't feel like I fit in the stereotypical ADHD box. Does anyone else feel like this? Thank you for reading<33

Traumatic experience with injured wildlife,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:54:00,"A beautiful buck deer was hit on the road by my house and the person didn't even stop. His back leg was broken, compound fracture and he didn't seem able to walk. I dragged him on my property out of the middle of the road in a blanket. A person who stopped said they were calling the police. However, no one came. I landed up calling wildlife rehabber who told me the deer might recover because he was overall not otherwise injured and they can sometimes recover broken bones. The rehabber told me to watch it and see if it moved. However, I think maybe his other back leg was also injured because he did not get up or move around. The deer landed up being swarmed by flies, so the rehabber said I could cover it with a blanket. I called animal control and fish and wildlife but no one was of help and no one came. They don't do rehab and the literal only option is to have police come and shoot it. Ultimately this is what happened, right in my yard. It was horrific because the creature seemed to trust me and had his head up and kept staring into the house before this. 

I feel like I completely betrayed this animal. It brings me back to when I recently lost my beloved dog to hemangiosarcoma. All day I have felt dead inside and am questioning the meaning of life. I feel like maybe I should have let nature take its course. Who are we to say what the animal wants. I don't think I would want to be shot dead with a gun.

I Don’t Feel Real. How Do I Work At This?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:49:45,"Sorry for the vague title I just can’t really express how I feel exactly.

My best attempt would probably be that, I don’t feel like I am who people think I am? I just think I’m absolutely abhorrent, and I wonder why people want to be around me.

I’ve been battling back and forth in my head about cutting friends off because in my head I rationalise it as me keeping my moping to myself and keeping them from what I deem to be toxic behaviours in myself. I try to refute them but then I just rationalise it all over. 

Occasionally I’ll get this feeling of breathlessness, like I feel my heart sink when I consider that perhaps my friends lives would genuinely be better without me, I stop to consider what I offer them and I come up blank every single time.

I respect my friends agency and their choice to be friends with me but I just can’t shake the feelings and I really feel like I need to say, something. Recently I did have a small argument with some friends and I claimed I felt “infantilised” but really I was just working back from a conclusion and obfuscating the point. 

I mean this may be small but it’s gotten to the point that if I see myself in a mirror and think “I don’t look too bad” I feel genuinely disgusted with myself, I guess in short I just really hate myself. I can’t explain why, even now I hate that I’m writing this and I feel like I’m pushing a burden onto others, so apologies for that.

I feel I should note I don’t have feelings of self-harm or suicidal notions but I do often consider self imposed social isolation. Blocking friends, avoiding physical meetings etc. I just think it’s best if I am kept away from others. 

So I guess the main question is, how can I begin to fix this?

My life improved like I never thought it would,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:45:02,"I fell into a deep hole at the beginning of 2022. I made a bad decision with my job, then made a bad decision with my relationships. This begun a cycle of avoidance with me. I’d skip out on almost anything thinking I’d make another bad decision. Then, I got into a relationship with someone after my ex just to help me forget. These things started digging the hole for me.

I’d do nothing but play video games and spend time with my gf. For work, I’d only work a job for a week then quit because I either hated it or I got sick (I got sick with various things after having a rock solid immune system my whole life). Some days I’d hardly see the sun. My house was a horrible environment as well. I share a 2 bed 1 bath with my mom and she constantly smokes cigarettes inside and has cats that pee everywhere. The air felt toxic most of the time.

One day, my dad said he’s finally in a position to help me with college. This was great news as I’d been wanting to go to college for 3 years, but couldn’t. Mainly because I never took the first step. Thankfully, my dad gave me the boost I needed. He got a house that I rent and helped me enroll.

Once classes started, it was hard to adjust to being out and about again. I used to love driving for hours, but even the 4 minute drive to campus had be paralyzed with anxiety. Being in a lecture room for any longer than 10 minutes was just as bad. I eventually opted to online classes just that semester.

Being out of the house and away from my gf made me realize that she was the reason for most of my anxieties. After dropping her, I was 90% better. The only thing left was to adjust more to being in public. That’s when I started doordashing.  Now I’m back to “my old self” in a sense. I’ve got no anxiety anytime I do anything.

Panic attack TW: talk of s**cide,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:40:09,So a few weeks ago my bf and I were not having a good time with our anxiety. My bf has anxiety surrounding vulnerability in regards to his and his loved ones health and he chipped his tooth that night and he has no insurance. His panic triggered my panic and I had one of the worst panic attacks of my adult life (I’m 29) I said some things that I did not mean about wanting to end my life and my bf was really scared about that and he blocked me from going to the other room and was holding my arms down trying to prevent me from hurting myself. I was screaming and crying and in the midst of probably a twenty thirty minute panic attack one or possibly more of my neighbors thought I was being abused and called the cops. My bf and I both spoke with an officer separately and even though I felt a lot of embarrassment and shame i thought it’s over and I just need to use my tools and we both need to learn from this and start actively managing our anxiety better. Fast forward to today several weeks later and a lady that works in the building comes up to me and says she needs to talk to me and I’m already anxious because I don’t enjoy talking to this woman. She proceeds to say the cops were called  because I was screaming help me (which I did not say I was saying you’re hurting me because he was holding my arms after I said I was going to end my life; also trust me I know how this all sounds which is adding to my anxiety 😞) so I’m just basically like I already talked to the cop and I don’t want to talk about it with you because nothing happened. Again I’m fully aware how this sounds and I’m not able to speak more coherently to her because she basically just accosted with this information literal weeks after the event. Then she makes a thinly veiled threat to my bf who is not present that he is not on my lease and he needs to keep it down. And I’m just standing there mouth agape barely processing what is happening. Like not only was I not able to elaborate on a very complex and nuanced situation but I’m also being painted in a certain light that I’m far from comfortable about. After this she tries to make it about how she cares about me which if you met her and knew what she was like you would understand she does not. I am now perseverating on who thinks I’m being abused and aware that to the outside looking in it seems like I’m in a dv situation and that makes me sick to my stomach. They didn’t see my bf also helping me breathe when I was hyperventilating and holding me while I shook. It’s not fair that we both gave our matching accounts to a police officer and haven’t had any incidents before or after and this is how I’m treated and how my bf is being treated. Not to mention that he is the one responsible for paying rent and that we both have spoken to management together and because of that assumed they didn’t care that he wasn’t on the lease. I am at an absolute loss of what to do and I’m just trying to regulate my emotions and my bf is doing the same. I’m not even sure I want advice but it does feel good to release this from my brain. ,mentalhealth,General_Ad_1545,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ddtva1/panic_attack_tw_talk_of_scide/,3,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06

Struggling with life and what it brings me 19m,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:22:50,"I’m having a very hard time right now in life. I was arrested on a reckless driving charge and ordered to do 24 hours of community service which isn’t a lot but while working 48 hours a week and having no car makes it hard to get those hours in. I’ve been completely procrastinating completing those hours for the 6 months given to me to complete it. I did get to complete those hours with an organization but turns out the court does not accept those hours from that organization (doesn’t meet their standards). And now I’m left with only 5 days to get another 24 hours of community service. No other organizations that were listen by the court offer court appointed community service anymore and I have no other options left. I don’t want to go back to jail, I mentally cannot get arrested again, I can’t do that again. I work in a hospital as a OR CMA tech and am under constant emotional stress while working on patients and it’s taking such a toll with combining all of this with work. 

With all of that, I also want to say I’m a serial liar. I’ve lied my entire life to make myself look interesting and cool, ever since I was a kid no one liked me for who I was and or anything about me, so when I realized I could become someone else by lying I did. I lied about rowing for team USA in rowing, even though I did row but only for a high school team. I’ve lied I’ve worked at prestigious hospitals and helped operate in patients even though cmas do not have those types of skills, I’ve lied I was a bad ass kid in high school messing with the wrong people and coming on top. I’ve lied about being a really cool rally racer even though I just liked driving off road in my previous car a ford fiesta. I’ve made my self look like a completely different person and I know the lies will catch up with me one day. 

All my friend around me won’t understand my feeling or will help me which lead me to write this to tell my true story no one will ever here. I don’t know what will happened if the court finds out I didn’t complete the community service hours.

I have severe bipolar disorder that I am very good at bottling it up, I appear as a very calm person but what people don’t see is me punching walls breaking my belongings and beating myself up or just existing. I get overly mad for things that happen to me. 

One of my breaking points in my life was when in highschool my ex showed up to my house telling me she was dying and needed me to come outside to talk. I did and her friend shot me with a nerf gun (for senior assassin). She had brought 5 people along with her and film the entire thing. Including the part where I slam the door and punch a hole through the wall in my house while yelling.

After A died I started analysing what I did wrong or how I could have prevented their death. I worried a lot about other people in my life who also suffer from mental health problems. I could not afford to lose anyone else. I tried to be a good friend and listened to their problems while not burdening them with my grief. About one month after the funeral one of my friends who we can call B had a really bad day so I tried to be there for them. We texted a lot during the day, but things got worse and worse. B started saying that they wanted to die. Then they stopped responding. I called and called. No answer. My worst nightmare started to become reality. After a while B texted me back. They where alive.

After that night our friendship changed. At a time where I needed support I forced myself to be the support of others. But I did not have any choice really.  B might have died if I wasn't there for them. After what happened I begged B to get help but they didn't want to. (They said they would get therapy, and I offered to help them get an appointment. But it didn't happen untill several months later.) I worried all the time, I felt helpless. I was not only worried about B, I have a handful of other people who also was at risk of dying by suicide. I think i didn't grieve properly because of the responsibility of keeping others alive. I  ended up getting depressed and dropping out of collage. 

After some time on antidepressants I still felt like shit but good enough to get back to collage. I tried to stay friends with B. But sometimes I got anxiety after hanging out with them. Sometimes so bad that I wanted to hurt myself (sometimes I did). But other times it was fine, but never as good as it used to be. After some time, I became scared to spend time with B because i did not know how I would feel afterwards. And after a lot of contemplating I desided to end cut ties with B. 

I do not feel good about it. A lot of the time I feel like a bad person. From Bs perspective they reached out when struggling and then lost a friendship. If they struggle with suicidal thoughts again I doubt they will ask for help again because of how I handled it afterwards. I wish I could have been a better friend. I am still scared B will die.

Why is my dad a shifty asshole?,2,1.0,2024-06-11 19:56:54,"Why is my dad such a shifty asshole

So for context, today I had a very important exam that I partially passed, I will most likely repeat the failed part after summer and when I phoned my parrents their reaction were these:


-Mom: understandable, supportive and somewhat pleased with my results and everything I told her what my professors told me after the exam

-Dad: ""YOU DIDN'T PASS!?"", agressive (even though he said he was calm and then told me why I was yelling even though I just slightly raised my voice to get to the) word, talked down on me (would later say ""he didn't mean it""), overall ignores the ENORMOUS amount of work he is well aware that I've put into prepearing for this exam, calls me crazy that I am going to therapy and that Im just wasting time


Now why do I think he is so shifty? Well its mainly because he's been telling me quite often for the past couple of months, that I shouldn't worry if I don't pass the first time and that I just need a bit more time to get it. That is before he doesn't get pleasing results and just does a 180° and says that the only reason why I passed my 1st year exams was because my mom ""helped me"" (she didn't, I did most of the learning, she'd just ask me questions before dinner) again compleatly disregaring another exam that I did after that one and passed it on the 1st try.

I really, REALLY, R E A L L Y don't want to hate my father like he hates his but ever since I started college I've either fantasized about hurting him the same way he hurts me or just doing something terrible to myself since it's been fucking misrable (hence why I go to therapy).

Desperate and need advice,1,1.0,2024-06-11 23:41:00,"Hey guys, I need some insight for the time being concerning my mental health (seeing a counselor in a couple days and looking for psychiatry appointment too). I’m really freaked out and have never been a worse mental state.

To try to keep it brief, I got Covid for the the first time in 2021 and had some trouble breathing which triggered some anxiety (I don’t have GAD), but when the Covid was gone I felt all better. Then I got Covid again, and was prepared for the anxiety this time but also developed a hyper-awareness of my breathing. The months following I would have intrusive thoughts about my breathing that I tried really hard to suppress. Well, that worked for a couple of months but was still bothersome to me. 

Fast forward to last week, I was on vacation with my family and on Monday night I took a delta-8 10 mg gummy (I’ve done regular edibles a handful of times). I actually had a really good trip. My sister was upset she missed out on the fun and we took one again the next night, this time I was way less high but had no negative affects. I don’t know if this is relevant but I wanted to include it just in case. 

On my vacation this hyperawareness of my breathing became so intense that I started to worry. I thought to myself, “maybe I’m not the only one who struggles with this” and I looked it up (this was Friday night). Somatic OCD was the first result and realizing I might have it sent me into a mind blowing panic attack. I stopped eating for 3 days and was throwing up/ dry heaving non stop. I went to ER and by this point I was disassociating and was have seizure-like compulsions. They gave me anti anxiety and a sedative that put me to sleep. When I woke up the next morning I felt really tired and tried to go work. My anxiety started to skyrocket at work and I couldn’t function. I picked up my Xanax prescription and it helped me calm down for a bit and went back to work and felt okay for the rest of the night. This morning I knew I couldn’t make it through work without the Xanax and so I took one before I left and had a pretty good day at work. As soon as i felt my medicine wear off I began to skyrocket and have extreme anxiety again, what felt like rolling panic attacks. I don’t know what to do and I’m terrified I will never feel normal again. It’s been a week today since I took the second gummy so I am totally unsure if it’s related. I’m scared of losing my job, I haven’t been able to do a single house chore, and feel the most terrified I’ve ever been. Does anyone have any insight or advice until I can be seen by a professional?

Like, when he is angry he'll make threats like I'll break your legs or I'll knock you out. I'm so angry and so afraid all the time. Also, though I live in a nice upper-middle class suburban neighborhood now but my family struggled before then. We had problems with our money and living situation. We moved maybe 6 or 7 times because rent was too high to the point where we had to buy the house from our grandma because we couldn't afford the current apartment we were living in. It was old and messed up, which eventually led us to spending some time living at a hotel. I am extremely grateful for my parents and their sacrifices but, these events have made a me a somewhat timid person. Though we are much better now, I still feel very alone and out of place. I don't want to act like my household is terrible all the time because it is not. But I feel the need to run to escape. It's a strong urge that I feel like a fight or flight response. And I get nervous over little things all the time. We act like nothing we experienced ever happened which makes me even angrier. All this stuff has turned me somewhat cold. My siblings call me this sometimes and can be afraid of me and express this. Because I'm ashamed to admit I've take this anger and fear out in things in bad ways. Like unaliving animals. I don't do this anymore. And I don't enjoy it, but I also don't feel any guilt from it. I am afraid of myself sometimes and how far I'm willing to go. Deep down I am compassionate, but basic emotion and compassion is not my strong suit. I did this because I needed to feel strong. I needed something to understand the way I felt. I wanted to be the one with the power. It was an escape for my anger. People at school only increase these feelings. Sometimes people will laugh at me, talk about me, and make fun of me. They sit there and laugh at my with smiles on their faces and say I'm weird and say that I stare to much or there is something wrong with me.

How to learn a language associated with trauma?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 22:54:50,"Hey there!

For some context:

When I was a child, my family moved to a German speaking country. Now I'm not going to go into details, but I was abused by various individuals, especially those who were supposed to teach me German.

This culminated in me having panic attacks whenever I heard German being spoken. Ultimately stopping any chances I would've had at learning the language.

After 12 years, I managed to leave that country, with basic - intermediate German knowledge.

The issue is that I will probably move to another country where German is the primary spoken language, but I won't be able to converse or have a normal life if I can't learn this language. Every time I try my trauma surfaces and I can't focus.

  
What steps do I take to recover from this?

It's a strong urge that I feel like a fight or flight response. And I get nervous over little things all the time. We act like nothing happens which makes me even angrier. All this stuff has turned me somewhat cold as well. My siblings call me this sometimes. Because I'm ashamed to admit I've take this anger and fear out in things in bad ways. Like unaliving animals. I don't do this anymore. And I don't enjoy it, but I also don't feel any guilt from it. I needed to feel strong. I needed something to understand the way I felt. An escape for my anger.

"Shushing myself or saying ""shut up"" or ""you f***ing idiot"" out loud. What is this?",10,0.92,2024-06-11 09:18:08,"I can't afford a mental health professional and have mostly been just trying to figure myself out on my own but there are limits to what you can Google. 

I don't remember exactly when it started but the first time I really noticed this.. tick? Was when it started as a head jerk. 

I will be minding my own business and then my brain will decide to bring up a memory of something I did that I feel shame, embarrassment, or guilt about. I am a very visual person, I get lost in my daydreams often they are so vivid. So when I remember something, sometimes it's so vivid that I'm actually relieving the event. And then my head would jerk and I would wince, as if I was trying to literally shake it off. This went on from at least age 20-28, 34 now. It went away for a short period where I was really distracted and feeling okay about myself but then it came back sometime during COVID and it started involving me verbally saying ""Shhhh"" and then it becomes ""shut up!!""

My partner doesn't say much about it but I can tell she's distressed or thinks I'm maybe crazy and I think I'm maybe crazy too.

Constant Unbearable Pain ,2,0.76,2024-06-11 17:19:52,"Hello everyone, I just don't know what to do, I just can't get over pain of losing the future I fought and planned so hard for. Throughout college, I was dating this girl and we had a very serious relationship. She met my family (which all lives outside the country) so that was a monumental deal for me. We were each others best friends, etc, etc, typical love story. One day after graduation, we found out she was pregnant. It was a rush of emotions because I've always dreamed of being a father and this was my time to be everything I wanted to be. A husband, a father, a leader, a provider. It was the same month that I graduated that we found out so naturally my emotions were all over the place-happy, scared, nervous, anxious especially since I was just about to start my career as an engineer. It was sooner that I expected but I was ready to step up. Long story short, we lost the baby and it was absolutely devastating for us. Even though the baby was not born yet, the pain is unimaginable and I don't wish this on anyone. I would do anything to hold my baby girl right now. I ache for her every single day, its something you don't just heal from. I feel so connected to my baby girl but she's not here and it kills me everyday. Long story short, a few months later, we had a rough spot, I'm honestly not sure why, it just happened. Maybe the stress from me entering grad school and her entering more rigorous nurse classes? I'm still not sure. She ended up cheating on me and got pregnant by someone else. Now this is already absolutely soul-crushing as it is being cheated on, but knowing that our baby didn't make it and theirs did hurts beyond a level words cannot create. The guy is a terrible dude, he's already a deadbeat to one kid, has another kid on the way from his fiancee, and now has another one from the girl who I was suppose to marry. This hurts my soul so much because everything I fought for so badly got ripped away so fast. Its all I think about everyday, what my life was suppose to be and now its so lonely, so empty, so meaningless. I was suppose to be a father. I was suppose to be a husband. She was suppose to be a stay at home mom. But now, its just empty. The void of what was suppose to happen is ruining my everyday life-more so the fact I should be playing with my daughter. To make matters worse, I've only been in about 3 relationships in my life. This was my first ""real"" relationship but the other 2 ended almost exactly the same way.

All 3 girls I was with cheated on me and then had a kid with the guy they cheated on me with.

Need advice on what to do,1,0.99,2024-06-11 20:47:28,"Hi there! This post is a bit of a mess, as I can’t coherently explain my thoughts, but I will clarify anything if necessary.

All throughout my life, I’ve been describing myself as being extremely lazy. I had trouble finding motivation to do monotonous tasks like homework or studying uninteresting subjects, especially after finding comfort in video games. However, if given task seemed interesting or challenging, I would find myself fully immersed in trying to master it. Thanks to it I actually managed to get good grades and be deemed as academically gifted. 

However, for the past few months my gf kept telling me, that I definitely have ADHD, and that I should seek professional diagnosis, to manage it, as it has been impacting me lately, causing me to lose all motivation, so much so, that even my hobbies stopped giving me joy. 

Now here’s where I have a bit of a problem. I don’t have enough money to go seek therapy on my own, so I’d need to ask my parents. Now, I haven’t told them about it, because firstly I don’t want them to see it as my excuse for my lazy behaviour and secondly I have hard time in general, confronting them about any difficult topic. For unexplained reason, it’s extremely difficult for me to ask them anything, as I don’t want to come off as ungrateful. On one hand, I do want to get diagnosed, or at least try. But on the other, the thought of trying to explain to my parents that I suspect I have ADHD, which I think they wouldn’t recognise as a problem but more of as an excuse, makes me very stressed.

Any tips on how I should approach this?

Tips for seeking FMLA leave for work-related anxiety and depression,1,1.0,2024-06-11 19:33:26,"Hello!

I'm seeking advice from the community on taking FMLA.

I've been seeing some conflicting information online, and am trying to get a few facts straight.

1. **PCP Sign-off:** I've seen some say that PCPs can sign off on FMLA easily, while others say that they may be unwilling to until they've referred you to a psychiatrist for their opinion. Is this purely situational and dependent on your PCP?
2. **Psychiatrist Sign-off:** Some people are saying that they were able to make an appointment with a psychiatrist, who was able to sign-off on FMLA right away while you receive additional treatment. However, the first two clinics I have reached out to have said that their policy is 3 sessions or 3 months of sessions before they can sign-off on FMLA leave. Is this the norm? Or should I continue to seek out someone who can help me quicker?

I've been in weekly therapy to help manage my anxiety and depression for over 2 years through BetterHelp, and unfortunately, my therapist said it's against company policy for them to be able to sign-off on this for me directly. However, if I sign a release form, they said they would be happy to give their recommendation to my PCP or a psychiatrist. This is helpful, but I'm not sure if this would even go anywhere.

Under normal circumstances, I would be fine with a 3-month assessment from a psychologist. However, I genuinely feel like I've reached my limit with work, and it's spiking my anxiety. I'm days away from quitting if I can't get FMLA leave (which I understand may have other career-related consequences that I've given a lot of thought about and am willing to risk), so I really don't think I can wait this long. It's just not worth sleepless nights and chronic stress, and I want to move on.

I have a few appointments lined up, so ultimately, I will have more info soon. I just wanted to make sure I was going about this in the right way and have the right expectations for this.

How do I stop dissociating?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 19:14:39,"I was in an extremely abusive relationship for 5 years and during that time I believe I was dissociating for the majority of the relationship. If it helps at all I am autistic as well as have ADHD. I plan on going to see a psychologist here soon again as soon as I have the money for it. 

The trouble I’m having is that I believe I am still dissociating at times, but possibly don’t know I am doing it. What freaks me out is that my brain “replaces” uncomfortable memories with positive interactions. That is the best way for me to describe it. I actually don’t know if that is considered dissociation or something else. 

An example:

During my abusive relationship my ex had to remove some flowers that I loved and would tend to every day. He HAD to get rid of them it wasn’t something that he was doing to intentionally hurt me. When I say I loved those flowers I mean I LOVED them. I didn’t have much left that was mine at the time. From my recollection I told him I understood and helped him do the stuff that had to be done and I was fine with it. Fast forward a year or so later he brings up the time I had the “extreme meltdown” over the flowers. I tell him I didn’t have a meltdown I was fine with it and understood why. He is adamant that I had a meltdown and at that point I thought maybe he was just gaslighting me. Well I’m talking to my mom the next day and tell her about him saying I had a meltdown…well she confirms that I did in fact have a meltdown. 

I still to this day have no memory of a meltdown and in fact have a distinct memory that everything went fine.

Now back to the current time. I’ve been out of that relationship for 4 years now and have been in a great healthy relationship for a little over two years. When I get stressed with work and life I find myself discovering that it’s possible that I’m doing what I did before. My partner will say something happened and my memory of it is different. It is very upsetting for me, but I believe him because I know it has happened before.

I don't really have hobbies or interests and haven't done in years, all I really do in the evenings is scroll the internet, but this all feels normal for me.

I dropped out of my university twice because I kept thinking that I was useless and wouldn't be able to accomplish anything.

I need to be better,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:57:01,"Suggestions, strategies needed.

I’ve come a long way in my mental health, anxiety and depression. I’m a mom and a wife and live in a country that is not my own. I have no strong family ties but I have made a few friends here. 

My husband got very frustrated with me recently, saying I need to take more control of my mental health. I am currently not taking medication or in therapy. I am uncomfortable with medication and all the local therapists have massive wait lists.

I take care of our kids and do all the household jobs. He is frustrated that I lm too tired to work on the farm with him, to work on the paperwork side of the business (he won’t do paperwork) and that I don’t have any hobbies. He says I’m just a sad lump on a log and he isn’t looking forward to being together for the rest of our lives if I can’t be a better, more productive person. 

I do cope with things by shopping. I’m insecure about my body after having kids and hitting my late 40’s. I buy lots and lots of clothes we can’t necessarily afford because I just want to not look awful in something. I’ve started working out and I’ve lost some weight finally, but he’s upset I’m doing that instead of getting outside and working on the land. 

I know I need to work outside more, I know I need to stop shopping, I’d love to make art again like I used too before the kids and the business. I’m just exhausted. I have to start waking up at 5 with my husband from now on. I also need to be calmer and stop taking my bad moods out by yelling at my kids or saying hurtful things to my husband. I’ve stopped  myself from having panic attacks most of the time, even when my depression is hitting hard I still make sure the kids are well cared for. I have a lot of good coping skills too, but I’m not sure how to hit the next level of getting better.

Struggling with Chronic Pain and Mental Health at 30,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:55:35,"Hello, I’m 30, male. I don’t know where to start or why I’m writing here, but whatever. I’m having increasing trouble getting through life. I broke up after being in a relationship for 5 years, and 4 of those were rather unhappy. I’ve been feeling progressively worse, both physically and mentally. Because I swallowed my anger and dissatisfaction all those years, I felt empty and lost. I thought the breakup would be the best thing and that I’d feel better because of it. 

Now, four years ago, I got sick. At first, I didn’t know what it was, just had pain all over my body. Some days, it was almost impossible to dress myself. I could barely move my neck for almost a year, which was unimaginable to me since I was always sporty and agile and never had such problems. After countless doctor visits and tests, it turned out to be ankylosing spondylitis (Spondylitis ankylosans is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease. It primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints but sometimes also other body structures), and also hip dysplasia wich courses pain in the hip area. I got medication but The pain was bearable, sometimes better, sometimes worse, but there was always a slight stiffness in my body.
I also suffer from tinnitus, which I’ve had for almost 15 years, and it significantly worsened last year. It’s like a 24/7 distraction in my head, and I got used to it but now that it got much worse making things increasingly difficult. My mind doesn’t come to rest.

I feel increasingly lost and, in my early 30s, physically and mentally at my wit’s end.

In the past, I would have told myself, ""Okay, take fewer drugs and take care of yourself, then you’ll feel better again,"" which I did. I joined the military, was sober, exercised a lot, and was disciplined. All of that has largely been lost in everyday life. I mean, I eat healthy and stay active by doing sports. I still occasionally take drugs, but only on the weekend with friends, within limits. 

But I’m getting older, and the physical issues are getting worse. It feels like my body is giving up at just 30 years old, leading to mental problems, and I can’t just tell my body to stop being sick. I feel worthless and ugly because the signs of aging are visible on me.

What should I do in this situation?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:48:27,"I am 19 yo, and I am having a hard time in the second semester of university, and that ranges from:
- 
-
having anxiety at mechanic class (the teacher manages to make it a living hell despite me sitting in the front, writing everything on my notebook and studying, but since I am recovering from burnout, it's now harder, and that makes me procrastinate sometimes due to not being able to focus and study at home)
- 
-
trying to uncounsciously avoid the next day by sleeping late
- 
-
beginning to stay at university to avoid home (I think the reasons behind that is that my family knows I am having a hard time at university (this course of mechanics is making me and my classmates to study exclusively for the course tests, and I believe that more than 75% of the class won't pass this semester in mechanics alone) and completly ignores it or (in case of my sibling) tickles me when I am trying to rest or procrastinate (wich pisses me off, because I am believing it's because they think it's laziness, and not me having a hard time) and asks me why I won't play with them or even asks if I am really going to study (wich drains my mood even more), and for the rest of the family members who lives with me, asks me to help with mudane things when I am studying and my sibling is free to help them, and even becoming mad when I refuse (wich obliterates my study routine) 
- 
-
my family disliking my hairstyle and clothing preferences (I lived my entire life untill 17 yo using the hairstyle and clothing they wanted, but nowadays I am exploring what I enjoy. But I can't still negate that this is impact my life, since it's relatively common with subtle things (like saying my fringe is covering my eyes and will hurt my vision or laughing at me for using a clothing or hairstyle that is different than what I used to have, or even asking why I don't show my forehead (the reason being that I disliking the style, but they won't listen) and saying I shave everyday (wich is far from true, but they won't listen that I dislike having a beard or body hair other than my head hair and that very likely it won't change) 
- 
-
my grandparent who lives in my house dislikes criticisms or being pointed out as being wrong, and is a controlling person since the time of raising my parent
- 
-
I am starting to believe that they are indirectally blaming me for not going to pass the course and loose my scholarship (I can't deny I could do better at the beginning, but feeling that they are ignorating my attemps to improve and my huge growth that I had and not even supporting me emotionally is infurating)
- 
-
I want to help them financially and to make them have a better life on another country after graduating. But their behaviour and the fact my graduation will be slower is also impacting me (my uncle and aunt said they can help me if I don't pass, but I am worried about their finances even thought my aunt has a profession that pays good in my country, and honestly, I know somewhat what to do if I don't pass, but I am afraid of getting stuck again in the same situation when retaking the course or studying in another university
- what should I do to atleast have a slightly better time (even if it's on the next time)?

-
tl, dr:
- I am having a hard time at university (despite my attempts to improve it), i feel that my family doesn't help, and I want to ame my family have a better life

Does Trauma ever really go away? Am i crazy?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:30:37,"As a kid, I was abused by my mom, mostly emotionally but with a few moments of physical (I think, I wasn't ever truly beaten but food was withheld commonly and I was underweight when I was kicked out of her house when I was around 11, to which i went to move in with my dad.) I had it decently with my dad but he pushed me to be extremely independent, and thus (and this is what my stepmom has told me) not really have a proper childhood. When I was 15 i cut contact with my mom, to which she freaked out (She has borderline personality disorder that's mostly untreated if that helps in describing her actions and mannerisms), and there was a huge fight but I ultimately won. Shes done some other stuff over the years, such as sending me an email while I was at work (age 18) on why it was my fault that she tried to commit suicide, and I also found out later that my dad was not even my biological dad, and the list honestly goes on. Also after the years that I moved out she refused to let me talk to my sisters, claiming I was a ""threat"" to her family and that everything that happened was my fault. 

My dad put me in therapy at a young age, because he didn't know exactly what happened with my mom and I didnt realize that what happened at the time wasnt normal behavior. I got iq tests, diagnosis and inititally I was diagnosed with abandonment issues before eventually being diagnosed with trauma induced depression. 

  
My therapist always praised me for how well I managed it, and at the time I agreed, but now that i'm older (22F) I don't feel like ive managed it well at all. My memory is awful, and i can't remember anything until I do if that makes sense. Ill have moments of clarity and then ill spiral. Im also married now, with a 1.5 year old, and my husband always argues that if i can't rationalize why i feel a certain way, then i shouldn't feel that way at all. I wish he would just let me be upset sometimes but he always gets annoyed if I am. It doesnt help we have been rocky due to some internal issues of not feeling loved, but part of me feels like i want too much. Lately I just feel like a child, I want to cry all the time, and I just feel so isolated and lonely. I find myself with a strange urge to go home, but I'm not really sure what that even means. I guess my question is, is this feeling ever going away? I don't like medicine because I can never really remember to take it consistently, but im really consider going back on it (I got off when i lost insurance at 19). I want to be a good mom too , so i'm desperate to get better. 

Is it wrong to still blame my mom for these feelings? Could I have more than just depression?

How can I regulate my newly super dysfunctional emotions?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:14:25,"I’m in my early twenties (F), and have quite a lot going for me. I am surrounded by a proper community of family and friends with whom I have built very strong and genuine, loving relationships with in the past few years. I have been blessed with work opportunities to do what I am truly passionate about doing. 

But it feels as though a switch has gone off and I am told by those who are the closest to me that I am acting unlike myself. My emotions feel incredibly dysfunctional, and I can tell myself that I am not centered. 

The simplest way to put it is that I have gone from being very lighthearted and free spirited to very negative. I complain about everything or feel numb/could care less about anything. I care very little for potentially building new friendships and even in social settings, regardless if related to work, I don’t engage in conversation or entirely seclude myself physically. Then suddenly I’ll be super positive, back to my “normal” self, laughing and joking around as if I’ve done a mental 180 within the next hour or within the next day. Only for that to completely regress into a heightened emotional outburst that can be quite aggressive verbally due to being “triggered” or stressed/angry about something. Doesn’t have to even be major, just enough for me to be ticked off. 

It’s exhausting and unlike me and I see how it is toxic and exhausting to those around me. I don’t know what’s happened, but it’s beginning to make me think very bad things about myself despite everything in my life being a dream come true. I can tell something’s wrong, but I’m having trouble catching myself and fixing it. My emotions tend to overpower my logical thought.

There can be several reasons for this. I’ve had a lot of stresses due to major recent life changes but tbh even those I feel like I should be able to handle and not let the stress get to me because they’re all really good majors life changes. Throughout my life I’ve had some pretty traumatic events happen to me, however I’ve worked through them due to counseling/working through it with my partner, and I don’t see how they could be causing this. 

At the bottom of my heart, I know I’m happy. I feel like I’m in a constant battle with this weird version of myself and I’m so tired of it. How do I regulate my emotions? How do I catch myself and manage this? If there is any clarity of what could be causing this?

please please help,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:06:07,"

Brother’s (21M) behaviour is concerning. He wakes up angry very often. Small things anger him, which seem to anger him to no limits. He will fixate over small problems that occur in daily life (such as shirt being wet) and hold on to this/ be angry about it for hours. He is in a terrible mood every single day, probably since years now if I’m being real. He doesn’t enjoy interacting with anyone from the family. He is rude to people who try to talk to him. He does not want help from others when he is angry or irritated. He isolates himself, acts depressed, and then goes to sleep for hours. When asked about anything, his standard answer is ‘nothing’. He takes no responsibility around the house nor does he listen to others when they ask him for his help regarding anything. He is extremely narcissistic and self centred with little empathy. He has some good moments during the day, which are extremely rare. What I’ve observed is that he has a lot of constant highs and lows. More lows than highs though. He doesn’t know how to manage his emotions and constantly argues with anyone when they try to talk it out with him. He is disrespectful and raises his voice, leading to no productive or constructive conversation/criticism most of the time. Needless to say, he does not communicate with anyone. This is probably out of choice since we have prompted him to seek help from us multiple times. He does not realise how his erratic behaviour affects others. But if it doesn’t change it’s likely to break the family apart. When we speak to him about it, sometimes he completely victimises himself and spirals while blaming himself, leading to another depressive episode. He also punches the walls and throws things around when he is pissed off. Small things trigger him which cause hours long of bad mood, anger, depression and the cycle repeats. It seems like he has deep resentment towards everyone, for no apparent reason. Our existence simply is a disservice to him and we are all an inconvenience to him. That is what his behaviour communicates to me.

Any advice is welcome. If you have faced a similar situation, please let me know how you overcame it. He probably requires professional help but what kind? Kindly recommend. Does he have some sort of disorder?

"I imagine things, what's wrong with me?",1,1.0,2024-06-11 16:56:41,"[SLIGHT MENTIONS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE]

So the question is ""what's wrong with me?"".
I would like to know if the problems I will list are symptoms of something.

To clarify, I'm a minor (soon adult) that has never been to therapy. I've never in my entire life seen a specialist or been to a hospital. My parents think it's a waste of time.


The problems are affecting me greatly.

Throughout my entire life I've been imagining people watching me. I do not mean real life people, but imaginary people that usually appear next to my windows, inside my house. They make me feel judged, I always tried to restraint from doing anything they would deem weird.
Usually, they take form of my favourite characters (I find comfort in cartoons and shows) so it feels worse when it's ""someone"" I look up to.
My family was already calling me a weirdo and thinking I'm useless. So I was wondering if this affected me so much, it spread to fictional characters? I can't stand being next to windows. I know they're not real, I want to believe that they're not real.
Over the years I started to get used to it, so I'm less affected by it. I think it was at my worst at ages around 5-7 and 12-14.

Another problem with imagining things; the screams I hear.
Often when I leave my house, I can hear screams coming out of it. This only happens when I know my father is awake, because if anyone screamed in pain it would be because of him.
I have a little sister, and every time this happens I just freeze in fear and I'm petrified. What if something really happened? Me and my brother are the only ones who got abused to this extent as little kids, she's not been in that situation yet, but I can't keep thinking of something happening.
I usually calm down, but then I'm late for school or work, and it's been affecting my education greatly.

Another case of imagining things, I feel presence or I see dark figures at night. I am convinced I will get hurt or killed or worse, though most of the figures look too inhuman so I sometimes have doubts if they're real.
Right now when I'm writing this, I know they're not real. But literally every other time I am actually scared and I feel as if it's real.

I was thinking if me imagining things was some kind of a mental illness? I am not able to be diagnosed, and I don't talk to people (I often limit myself to hand gestures) so it's hard for me to get any kind of help.
My grandmother has a really bad schizophrenia, she isn't even able to have normal conversations.

Or all of this might be because of the abuse I've gone through, I'm assuming.


I might make another post describing my other problems, and I would love to find out if everything is somehow connected. I am not a fan of self diagnosis, but this is the only way I can take a first step to help myself.

Should I tell my parents about sh?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 16:47:36,"My parents aren’t best with mental health. They themselves have problems but they don’t treat it seriously, though I haven’t had any serious talk with them about it in general. I don’t think they’d believe I have issues myself. I try to not imply I have depression since I’m afraid of claiming an illness that I might not have. People have told me I am healthy and I don’t need any professional help but it’s only because my anxiety is more apparent that my depressiveness.

So I’m scared of telling them. They’re gonna know it anyway. But I think if it’s better to talk to them myself instead of them randomly noticing. My parents get really explosive, they’re gonna be negative.

I need recommendations on coping with emotional dysregulation stemming from ADHD. ,1,0.66,2024-06-11 16:36:24,"I've(23f) had ADHD for years, but was actually diagnosed in the last year. it's caused me anxiety, depression, causes me to have issues making friends, makes it hard for me to trust, issues with cleaning but most recently, emotional dysregulation and anger issues. 

I've always kinda had anger issues, throwing things, yelling, cutting people out of my life, etc. but between that and my emotional dysregulation, I feel like I'm going to lose my 4 year long relationship. we will get into an argument, and seemingly it doesn't matter what it's about, I just shut down. I get choked up, I cry, I do my best not to yell, and I feel physically incapable of talking. this is where my bf(32m) doesn't quite get it. he also has ADHD but has had an extra 9 years to navigate the world and find coping mechanisms. I really love him, and he says that he still really loves me, but we're walking on a very fine line together and I feel like any second could be the last together. 

so PLEASE, how do you navigate emotional dysregulation/anger issues/trust issues/etc, with ADHD? I would love to go to therapy but I can't afford it. I want to make things work with him, I want to make things work with myself, as I've been very unhappy with myself for a long while now. any coping mechanisms, free therapy, ways you and your ADHD partner navigate stuff like this, anything?

"My partner has significant mental health concerns, and I just need support. ",1,0.67,2024-06-11 16:25:11,"The relationship I’m in is fairly complex and has been very rocky. We’ve only been together for 10 months now, and during this time they have had several instances of deep depression along with multiple expressions of SI. They are on medication, but due to insurance issues and America’s deplorable medical system, their meds have lapsed a few times. They have also been inconsistently seeing their therapist for the past 5-6 months. 
And I am burning out, quickly. Throughout this time I have struggled with my own mental health issues, not to mention going through the process of a divorce (different relationship), along with life’s just typical stressors/challenges. I have a background in mental health but since this is so personal, it’s been extremely hard to practice what I’ve learned, paired with the fact that I cannot be my partners therapist. There have been so many good times in our relationship and I love them very much. I don’t want to end the relationship but I am at a loss. During the “dark times” they have said and done some relatively unkind things to me personally and I have chalked it up to them struggling. But, I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, terrified that I’ll receive a call that they’ve done the worst imaginable thing, or them slipping into a state of rage as it is their typical response to a trigger. I am extremely sensitive to people’s rage due to past experiences and trauma, so this adds additional pain to the situation.
I feel I can’t turn to my friends or family for support because they say “just break up with them” and it’s not that simple. I’m invested, I love them, but I am hurting and feel my “shine” dimming. I feel like I can’t heal myself because I’m always on standby for them. It’s an ugly pattern of things getting better for a few weeks, which convinces me to stay and I begin to feel some security, then bam, outta the blue we’re back to square one. I can feel my patience and empathy dwindling too, and don’t always have to capacity to listen to them when they are more than venting.

I don’t really know where or how to start but I’ve definitely had high anxiety for a very long time. I constantly over analyze everything that I do and even everything that I think; with just about all of these actions and thoughts I end up thinking about whether or not that’s what is morally right or if that’s what a perfect person would do, I subconsciously do this during/immediately after I do or think things and even when I’m not doing anything I still analyze what I should be doing and how I should be doing it. It even happens with the smallest of things. I also have a lot of things that I feel like I want to accomplish but I can rarely take action. At first I thought the lack of motivation could be depression related but It’s weird because I feel like I do have motivation but just not enough to get me going all the way and I don’t necessarily feel depressed more so just a slight disconnection or something idk. I also have realized I tend to day dream and think about possible scenarios which makes it hard to focus sometimes and it sometimes causes me to immediately forget what people are saying and what I’m doing (like if I’m looking for an item etc.) another thing is I often get a feeling like I need to cry but I stop myself and the feeling just slightly lingers for a little bit and then goes away. Another thing is I always convince myself momentarily that what I was feeling wasn’t even real anyway.

I have a problem,1,1.0,2024-06-11 15:26:06,"I'm posting this again because I really need advice and directions. Hi, everyone! This is my first time posting on Reddit. And I'm not how it can help me but I've decided to give it a shot. Before I begin I just wanna say that English is my second language so there might be some grammatical mistakes here and there. This might be long so bear with me. So my problem began over 2 months ago and it's been making me crazy. Over 2 months ago I heard this bizarre story on YouTube through a story narration channel. You know those channels where they use AI voice to read stories that are written in reddit formats. With the #s for algorithm and no source provided of the original author. Anyways when I found this particular story my gut kept telling me not to view it but curiosity got the better of me and I did and well, it went down hill. Firstly, I started looking for the source of this story and saw that it was nowhere on Reddit or any other platform. Nobody in the comments could provide a link or confirm if the story ever existed on Reddit. Now, I'm 100% sure the story is fake and was never on Reddit. It has a lot of inconsistencys and plot holes and the premise itself is bizarre. But the problem was that I became obsessed with it. To the point I sort manifested myself as the main character. I started to feel their emotions which were heartbreak, pain, anxiety, betrayal etc. all of these emotions are overwhelming me and I'm sick of it. I wake up in the morning sad and I often get triggers. I picture some of the characters in people around me. And it makes things worse. Even in the last few weeks I was able to thin it down and get over it a bit but my mind keeps relapsing and in the last couple of days it has become hard. I came here because I was very overwhelmed and didn't know what to do.

Now let me give a brief about the story in question. It is a story about a guy who's girlfriend suddenly dissapeard and 5 years later he found out that she had ran off with his brother to Canada and had started a family and his own family( parents, relative's) knew about it and kept it a secret. I know a bizarre plot but the story has a lot of problems such as it has very little relationship dynamics, it has a lot of details missing line the OP never mentioned the comments because if it was a real post people would have asked a lot of questions and the story ends on a weird note which just creates a lot of questions. I don't know why I became obsessed with it because I've red worser stories than this but somehow I became.

Anyways I came to this sub asking for help and will appreciate any help that anybody provide. And also can anybody please help me confirm me that the story titled ""My Girlfriend Disappeared right before my Proposal And 5 Years Later I Find Out She Ran of with my brother"" to see if it's real or not and if it was ever on Reddit? It will help me out a lot. Apparently it was on aita. Sorry to make this so long I've going though this for a while now and just want help.

I was having hard time because he was a cat I really chose for myself(btw all of my cats were born into our family and not adopted) because I felt deep connection with him like I did w my other 2 cats(that passed away 3 years ago) and I felt finally ready, we were having amazing time but one evening he was run over because he left our yard (we live in rural area so most of us have out-door pets)

On April 15th my grandma passed away, late night, my mom was talking to her 40 mins before she passed away. She died of heart attack in my grandpa's arms. It was really sudden because she was known as healthy one, she never went to doctor because she always found herself a home remedy for any type of sickness (that would actually work) however, she died due to having water in her lungs. A month before she said her back was hurting but she was getting better, 2 days before she passed away she even sang with my grandpa, as she always said ""Sing so loud to forget any type of pain"".

People said I should get a new provider, so I have an appointment with one tomorrow. I am using some of my rent money to pay for it. This is after having two panic attacks, the second one way scary, on top of struggling to care for myself. 

I am so anxious now I throw up anything I try to eat. I can't shower because of my anxiety (and I need to clean out my shower) and overall am struggling to function. 

I'm stressing about it a little because I don't know what I am going to do about rent, but my OCD support group told me I was making the right decision. I'm also stressing because I know when I ask my mom to pick up my meds and bring them to me shes going to complain bc she's already been out here this week to bring me groceries (I can't drive, nor do I have a car). A friend also helped me out by ordering me bath wipes, shampoo caps and a few other items so I could at least get clean without having to get in the shower. I also ordered kid scissors  (too scared to order grown up scissors) to cut my own hair. Its so dirty and matted, I look like a filthy troll doll. Or like filthy Vegeta. I've cut my own hair before but I am worried about how short I want to cut it. Never done a pixie cut on myself but I figure its hair, it will grow back. But the items won't be here until Thursday.

The point is that my mom will have to come out here 3 times (because all my amazon packages go to her address, bc we can't receive mail where I live) OR I will have to wait until at least Friday for meds and items. I'm not sure which option, because I don't feel like I can wait until Friday but I don't want to inconvenience my mom. 

I want to try the Geodon (the med my old psych yelled at me to forget) again because when it was working I cleaned my entire place, was holding down a steady job, wasn't having anxiety as much, wasn't depressed and was a functioning person. Then it suddenly stopped working and I ended up in a behavioral health hospital after a manic episode that kerplunked me into a HORRID depressive episode. There they switched me off Geodon bc they didn't wanna deal with the fact you have to eat 200 calories each time you take it (I took it 3 times a day, which was admittedly hard bc I have an ED and only eat once a day normally but I worked hard to keep up with it). BUT NO OTHER MEDICATION HAS WORKED THAT WELL. I would cut off my limbs just to feel that good mentally again.

I also want back on propanolol for my heart rate.

I can mutilate myself when things are bad to get better. Usually by hitting me, sometimes by cutting and biting my flesh. 



I suffer a lot from the eyes of others and I attach great importance to what they think but I always think of myself as judged, betrayed and abandoned sooner or later.

My wife and I have been struggling for a while and now we’ve decided to see a marriage counselor. The therapist has been great, honestly. He asked me a question I haven’t been asked without strings being attached in a long time, “How do you feel?”. 

It took me a few seconds to answer because I really wasn’t sure. I finally said, “I don’t really feel anything.” He asked if that was towards my wife and I said towards everything. I don’t care about any relationship I have. I don’t care if I see anyone, speak to anyone, etc. 

I feel so much anger over the smallest things sometimes. To the point where I bite my teeth to hold it in and it feels like they’re going to break. I’ve lost all interest in old hobbies and don’t care to pick any up. 

My therapist asked if I’ve ever been through anything traumatic in my life and I told him about my careers. His eyes got wide and said, “That makes sense”. He said I’m showing signs of PTSD (not diagnosing me, just saying he sees signs of it), which was news to my wife and I.

With not being good at sex I don’t think I’ll really connect with a female here I feel like ima be alone for ever which I do like the peace and quiet but it does get lonely.

I feel like I’m just going to be a statistic in depression or even suicide, I just don’t care most days forcing myself to hang with family and pretend to be happy even tho I love them I just would rather be alone, I’m such a let down

Another New Job?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 10:26:22,"Again???

I'm not sure I have the strength to even look for a new job, but things keep adding up that make me wonder if I should start looking.

I've been there since March 1st and have not been well received. There was a married man that I was told harasses the women, and he came in, and I waited on him, and then he called back at the credit union to flirt with another woman. This triggered me, and I got very upset about this, and people became upset with me, saying there isn't much they can do. 

Also, no one will give me their cell phone numbers in case I'm running late. They each have one another's phone numbers, and I only have my bosses. 

Today when I went in one girl said you look terrible and I said I was sick. She ran upstairs to tell her mother who is also the CEO who called me and said I better go home before I get everyone else sick to which I said I need the hours I don't have sick time. When I started, 2 women were so sick for weeks. Coughing and sneezing. Blowing their nose. How come they could work while sick?

She said I could come in 2 hours early on Friday. 

Then I began researching, and there's a new law called New York State Paid sick time its mandatory for employers. For every 30 hours worked, one sick hour is accumulated.I texted this to my boss, and she said she'll look into it. 

We are merging with a new Credit Union on July 1st, and I also asked if I can go full-time since this new credit union is looking for a full-time teller.

I was told we will revisit the subject in July. (also our pay will be held the first 16 work days of July due to payroll changes and bi-weekly pay)

For me, it's just kind of adding up and making me feel as if I need to look for a new job.

However, I want to make a smart move and educated move, and I don't want to have to switch jobs as I am 56 this year.

Is this just a normal work environment? Does everyone put up with some sort of crap at their job? 

Maybe I should just stick it out...

How would I know when to leave? I don't want to act too hastily.

Or maybe my MI is causing my perspective to be askew. Maybe I'm over sensitive 

I have had a ridiculous amount of jobs and usually find myself having trouble navigating these types situations, then I quit.

Need help coping with death anxiety. Desperately.,2,1.0,2024-06-11 06:39:54,"I need help coping with death. Desperately. 

I (23M) have been struggling with death anxiety for weeks. I know I’m not old or anywhere near a natural death, but the fear has taken over my life. I just want help.

It began due to stresses in my life and some family passing last year in both mine and my girlfriend’s life. I was raised a Roman Catholic but I feel that my scientific education and life experiences has taught me to value verifiable evidence based knowledge. Now the fear of an eternal and absolute non existence consumes me. The fear of a slow death stealing my body and brain control from me until I could no longer said to be alive is a close second.

Since this crisis has begun, I no longer view my life the same. It’s like I’m acting out the person I used to be, but under the surface I’ve lost passion and love for things that gave me joy. 
I used to exercise 6 times a week and maintain rigorous nutrition regimes, but I can’t bring myself to do it anymore.

My loved ones support me and offer me comfort, but all I can see when I look at them is how much time they have left on this world and how they will feel as they pass. My girlfriend cherishes me and tells me it’ll be ok, and I try to focus on the life I want together, but all I can picture when I look at her is the thought of saying goodbye to her.

I’ve even had intrusive thoughts of suicide. I rationalise that my fear is a symptom of being a living biological human, but that fear evolves into the idea that since my fear of death is a human construct I might as well experience it now to relieve my fear and pain. The fear pulls me back to clarity.

I’ve been trying to cope. I learn and research about death, from the viewpoint of the sciences and theories/evidence of after life. It all makes me more afraid. Naturalism, Theism, Dualism, Reincarnation. I’ve spoken to priests, friends, family, even my coworkers. I’ve gone to therapy and it hardly helps. I’ve pondered over every argument for how final death wouldn’t be so bad, but none of it gives me comfort. I’ve even considered hypnotic past life regression therapy to see something to put me at ease.

I appreciate any answers and help I can get. Thank you ,1,1.0,2024-06-11 10:01:11,"
To this day, I feel like I can’t say I was abused because I wasn’t beaten up or battered. I feel like I’m blowing things out of proportion 

My stepdad used to slap me hard around the face when I did something wrong, the one time I remember is when I was about I accidentally took the car keys to the skatepark with me and then I got home and he slapped me in front of my friend.

One time my mum asked me to do something and I replied something which was rude - I can’t remember what it was but it wasn’t insulting or anything - then my stepdad stormed upstairs and strangled me against the wall with my legs raised off the ground in front of a different friend.

He also used to sit me down with the door closed and shout at me for about 30 minutes whenever I did something wrong. (Missing bus home for example). What’s stupid about this is I don’t remember a word he said but just how it made me feel.

I told my biological dad about this at some point and it got back to my stepdad. Or I might of confronted them when I was a teenager. I can’t remember. And then it became real - part of the family narrative and my stepdad had to face it.

So now, from time to time, he will joke about how he’s going to hit me if I do something wrong. In a way that implies that it never happened.

I think this gaslighting is what has lead me to think that it’s not a big deal.

Is it a big deal?

Does anyone else experience this?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 09:54:24,"I've been diagnosed with a few different disorders, which include BPD, OCD, MDD, GAD, and SPD. This is just for context. I need to know if anyone else has experienced this specific situation below.

I am in general disgusted with bodily fluids. Thinking about my own or other people's makes me gag, makes me angry, or literally recoil. I am grossed out by people's existence and the flesh suits we are forced to inhabit. I thought this might be because of contamination OCD or the SPD. I am also very fearful of being touched. 

I struggle with impulse control and that includes with sex. I crave the external validation and have no care in regards to how many people or who it is. I think about it daily and it's overwhelming. I need other people there. I don't like to be alone. 

It feels like there's 2 different people in my head fighting for control over my body. The one ""person"" wants to sleep with everybody and it's hard to think when that one is leading. BUT the other ""person"" who is disgusted with it all instills fear by focusing on the possibility of STDs or negative repercussions of those choices. I imagine the second person with a clipboard giving the first one a lecture. 

I want to also include that when I make a genuine connection with someone, that the disgust for bodily fluids disappears completely. The ones I have for my own body don't, but I find myself WANTING theirs. I don't understand this 180 degree shift. Also as soon as I lose trust for someone, I'm right back to feeling disgusted again.

Usually the second ""person"" wins because the fear is stronger than the desire to sleep with people. It's the only thing that's kept my life semi-functional. I've only had 2 sexual partners in my life and honestly that's amazing considering my circumstances. But it still leaves me feeling out of control and like my head is spinning. It's not like I come out of it satisfied that I've come to some sort of ""good"" conclusion to not have sex in an unsafe way. I usually feel stuck in limbo like I'm unable to act. I feel tired. My head continues to spin and I end up laying in bed. 

It bothers me that it feels like I'm a 3rd wheel to these occurrences. How do I go from being grossed out by people to craving it?

Can't be myself,3,1.0,2024-06-11 03:54:37,"People have historically always said ""Just be yourself and people will like you."" ""Just be yourself and you'll make friends."" But this factually isn't true, and I'm living proof of this. It's been taking a toll on my mental health. I feel completely alienated from other people in general, I feel like I can't keep a single friend or have any meaningful friendship, and I just feel alone.

Every time I meet someone and just 'be myself' it always takes a turn for the worst. I'm too negative, people don't seem to like what I have to say, and the relationship always becomes toxic and crashes. I've tried being fake around people, never giving opinions, acting collected and keeping myself together, being shy and quiet, but then I can never tell anyone anything and the relationship stays shallow, then eventually ends. I can't be fake because being fake results in no real friendships, but I can't be real because I'm just genuinely a horrible person that people hate more and more as they get to know me.

I could try to 'work on myself', but then that'd inadvertently be proving that 'being yourself and you'll get friends' is a complete lie. I don't want to have to change every faucet of my being just to fit in with humanity, because I am who I am. If I have to change to fit in at all, then that just means I'm not welcome here. There really is no winning no matter how I think of it, and it's all extremely upsetting. Sometimes I think I should just give up on friendships and be some cringy 'lone-wolf' type that doesn't need anyone, but I already know that's physically impossible because I'm a human being that needs social interaction.

Overall, I dunno. I dunno what type of replies I'm expecting from this either. I'm pretty positive nothing anyone says will help, and saying ""It's OK, everything will be alright, we all feel this way sometimes."" is just a generic non-helpful answer that'll only piss me off more.

Comparing myself to white girls ,102,0.85,2024-06-10 07:37:02,"I miss who I was before my last relationship. He always hooked up with white girls behind my back. I never had anything against them I’m not racist but I’m fucking Mexican, I know I’m not ugly I’ve been compared to Kali Uchis, and Kim Kardashian which are very beautiful women. I could never be like a white girl tho. One day I told him I didn’t think I was his type bc all he did was get with white girls behind my back and he told me I was and that he did like me. Next day he goes on snapchat and I had the urge to tell him to look someone up to make sure he didn’t have them added, on snapchat it shows the history of who’ve you searched and you can basically tell what they look like because of the bitmojis. The history was literally all white girls like a row of just 8 white girls.

Idk now when I see a white girl online I just think about how my ex would probably think they’re so pretty. It’s been a year and a half since I’ve even been with him and it still crosses my mind every time I see a white girl. At this point it’s driving me insane. 

(I forgot to add that one of the girls had actually interviewed me a couple months back for a job I really wanted that I had no idea she was at. Of course she didn’t give me the job all because of this man. She pretended to lose my job application and that honestly set me off even more with insecurity which is why I also couldn’t stop thinking about it.)

Needing advice on doctor push back,1,1.0,2024-06-11 08:24:38,"Things have been rough lately.. Just about every aspect of my life has been pressed and it's becoming difficult to even think straight. My daughter has had health issues, shes had issues at school, where a substitute teacher was investigated due to aggressiveness in the classroom and with my daughter and students (she was in Kindergarten btw) which has had my wife and I on edge, weve had financial issues, and ive had health issues ranging from back problems to having CT scans over pain I've been having in my lower abdomen. All the stress has caused me having difficult sleeping, and depression. And that's just from problems I've felt comfortable sharing lol..



I requested some time off from work. 3 weeks to be exact. And btw I requested NON PAID time off. I don't care about the money I'll be losing. I just need time to get myself and my family together. 



The problem is, my employer does ask for medical documentation because this is considered a mental health issue. And the issue is when I asked something similar a few years back, my doctor had a bit of push back, stating I'd have to go to therapy to get that sort if documentation. I tried meds a few years ago and didn't like it as well, so the last thing I want to do is just take pills for depression and sleep. 



I've talked to some friends and family about this and many of them have stated that if my doctor brushes it off again, I need to find another doctor. Because they said it shouldn't be this difficult getting documentation from a doctor stating they are supporting this time off. ESPECIALLY when im not hunting for money or disability. It's just so I don't lose my job.



Now if I take this time off and I'm still in a rough spot, then yea  im open to seeing what other options there are. But for now, I just need to take care of some issues and most of all, spend time with my family. 



What do you guys think? If my doctor continues the push back or flat out refuse the support, should I seek better support from another doctor?

I work most of the days and study when I am free but I cannot focus. I am struggling to pass the units and it’s hard for me to think about the fees that I will have to pay to do the units again and that my study year is going to be extended if I’m not wrong. 

And today my mom found me smoking cigarettes and the guilt is making me sick. Until now I am always feeling that guilt of failing, having no fun and buying things I love which are not necessary. I know I should be saving money which I do, I just buy things sometimes and go out sometimes with friends cause my parents are very strict and they worry about me spending too much money and also my safety. 
Idk what to do I’m not able to focus on my studies and feel like a failure everyday. I feel guilty when I go out with friends, when I eat out without my family, having fun and even being out late. This is making me hard to commit to a relationship and be open to my close ones. But today when she found me smoking I didn’t know what to say and do at that moment, now I’m feeling guilty makes my stomach sick.

Mild Depression (probably),1,1.0,2024-06-11 06:07:54,"TW// SMALL MENTION OF DISORDERED EATING

Hey y'all, F17 here, 

for the last 5 yrs of high school, life has been up and down. Or more like, my home life is fantastic (great parents, travels a lot, comfortably living, steady job, etc etc) but school has just been awful for me. shitty people going behind my back, not a ton of real good friends, I was overweight for the first half of high school and that took a toll on my mental health as well. I've felt very ""Meg Griffin-ish."" not an outcast like her, people talk to me — I just have NEVER really been anyone's favourite/first choice, and it has gotten me down. Recently, the thing that has had me REALLY down is my recent breakup.

Because of it, something has changed. I feel like an off switch (?) has been flipped in my mind. Im not suicidal, more like empty, and Im constantly living in the past, and daydreaming about a better school experience/friends. I deleted all of my social medias and unfollowed a bunch of people, I wanna throw away my phone completely and the thought of seeing people I know in my area makes me sick. I literally just want to ""disappear"" and restart my life when I go to university in September, with a clean slate. 

Sometimes after having fun with my only 2 real friends, I'll get home and get overwhelmed with emptiness, then cry. I dont know why, because I genuinely have the time of my life then go home and crash. I struggle with body image still and although I don't s/h, I do starve myself. I sleep normally but lately ive been having disturbing dreams about my ex and I can never seem to get my mind off of the fact that I had so much fun in elementary school, before everyone did me wrong. Im sick of people effing me over and treating me badly.

  
I am not diagnosed (AND NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS) but low-key I might ask for therapy. I feel like I have MILD depression at least, or depressive symptoms, because sometimes I cant even function, I sit in my room for hours and fall into a deep dark hole of thoughts and Im sick of it. Im sick of ruining my own fun, especially when other aspects of my life are so good. I wanna go one day without letting the thoughts consume me. Im tired of remembering how badly Ive been treated.

Much I eat. Toothless, and others I forgot. But my brother is a perfect angle and when I make fun of him he cry’s and gets all sad 
I am also worried my parents might split because they are clearly both on edge especially my dad. He is constantly mad at something. They are talking alone now and I am worried. They just seem to be fighting over the smaller things. This also is with the condom I found in the couch even though my dad had a vacsectomy a while ago but then my mom and my dad both just seem tense around eachother and I don’t get told anything they also told me
I get no freedom because I am a minor they said they have hidden cameras in some rooms which makes me feel very uncomfortable. So I just am trying to not do anything to big.
It is killing my mental health cause I like to know everything. I am starting to wonder if it is my fault. I also want to just disappear some times. I feel like I need to force myself to be happy even when I am not just to keep everyone happy. 
I don’t know what to do or what I should do. Like I said I don’t get told much and I am supposed to just agree with everything and do everything they say blindly. Should I say something or should I stay quiet? Or what all advice is welcome.

Pretty much his anxiety and depression has gotten so bad he almost never leave the house, he would say yes to anyone invite him out but not go or come up with an excuse at the last minute. This job was pretty much the only thing that got him out of the house. But even then it was exercise. He’s in a place where he can get easily distracted or triggered. He’ll spend three hours getting ready for work but leave the door when his shift started in 5mins. Other little things where his boss wasn’t treating him the nicest, he was sort of forced into a manager role,many times being left alone for hours on end. 

How he wasn’t fired for tardiness alone is beyond me. Anyway fast forward to this past December, he was kinda pressure sto participate in a Secret Santa and one a persons list they asked for a Twisted Tea. The lists went through management, nothing was said. My friend even asked their security if it was fine. They said it as long as it wasn’t opened or consumed on the premises. Fast forward after the fact the boss finds the Twisted Tea opened in their break room fridge. Never caught my friend drinking on the job, nor was he; but was fired because he brought it in. Now this was Christmas Week 2023. Almost 6 months. My friend has been trying to create some sort of letter to get his job back, laying out what’s been happening to him, making a plea. Personally I think he’s waited too long; so much so he could probably just reapply. 

I can’t see any HR company taking his letter legitimately justified or not. It’s just a greeting card store at the mall. But I think having that job was “keeping him together” and losing it destroyed everything. Since then his been home alone every single day with little to no interaction from anyway. Every time I come it like word vomit because I’m usually eh first person he interacts with. We have other roommates but they keep to themselves. So I think he’s attributing the job to the downfall of many things as his mental health has gotten steadily worse. He claims he’s been trying to get a new job but I question it cause he never leaves the house. Unless they’re all zoom interviews but again idk. I think it’s time for him to move on but he won’t see reason",mentalhealth,NaiRad1000,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dd1ocj/friend_thinks_his_entire_well_being_rests_on_him/,0,2.0,0.0,4.26823282356406e-06

I recently had a run in with a girl who used to physically bully me in high school and I didn’t necessarily come eye to eye with her it still stayed in my mind, then my partner brought up my sa experience because he had heard a rumor from his friends about two kids hooking up in high school and he said it sounded a lot like my story and began doubting me and my story.

By spiraling I mean I like start overthinking and it leads me to become dizzy, and then I start to feel nauseous and then end up vomiting. I do see a psychiatrist and I am planning to update him on all of this but I will be seeing him in 2 months so I have to wait, but meanwhile I wanted to see if you guys have tips for me on how to calm myself down, I’ve tried breathing exercises and distracting myself, but it doesn’t help me much.

I wouldn't say I'm a bad person or smth I just have nothing interesting to offer in a friendship, coupled with some negative qualities, too, which shows with most of my friends outright saying that they're friends with me due to a lack of better, interesting options.

This shows further when I realise that I'm moaning on a Reddit post on a sub where people actually have a reason to feel bad where as my issue is that I'm ungrateful for what I have... anyways:

I'm just a 'safe' option which I hate. I can't have the deeper friendships that I long for cuz I'm not good enough to have that luxury. It's unfair but It is what It is I guess.

i’m slowly realizing that i’m actually not okay,1,1.0,2024-06-11 03:44:30,"My anxiety has played a big role in my life for the past couple of years. I’m the type of person that would rather deal with it myself than ask someone for help because “it’ll pass or go away”. so, right before the pandemic and soon after i had actually spiraled. we had gone on a family trip and while at a hotel i had a panic attack and could not leave the hotel room. i sought out counseling and it was okay for a while.

Fast forward last year, perhaps the worst year of my life and the year that changed my life. we found out that my dad had been cheating on my mom— i was a big daddy’s girl growing up and my life changed completely after that. i never expected it to affect my anxiety but it did.

i began to worry about dumb things like what my family is thinking about us, how they perceive us, what my dad is doing now with his ‘freedom’, does he have another family now, will we eventually cut all contact with him??? will i never have an actual father figure in my life?? i assumed that they where insignificant fears that i was imagining but a few months into this year I started to notice a difference in me — and specifically in my thought process. 

i’ve begun to think a LOT about self harm… specifically things like ‘what if i offed myself right now before anyone came home?’ or ‘what if i took a little too much medication and yknow… make it or didn’t make it?’ i HATE it, never have i ever in my life EVER thought about things like that.. it terrifies me so much that i get severely anxious thinking about it.

also.. another thing that’s recently been in my mind aside from the previous topic is hurting someone else. i feel so disgusted with myself for even THINKING about hurting someone and even worse someone close to me (someone who genuinely loves me and looks after me). my anxiety has now spiraled out of fear that i might hurt myself or someone else…

i honestly don’t know if it’s common to think about stuff like this or if it correlates with  anxiety but i’m going through it… any thoughts?

For eg, once i gagged real loud cause the trash smelled bad. And that exact soundbite of my gag was just playing over and over the rest of the day.

Is this just an anxiety thing? Cause I've noticed it only happens with things said or sounds made by people in a distressing or angry way.

I'll start hearing people calling my name angrily, random yells or screams of a family member scolding someone, or crying. Or just phrases like ""Don't do that!!!"" ""Look here!!"" ""Please!!! Stop!!"" Etc etc. To stop this from happening i need to listen to a podcast, otherwise it makes me panic tf out.

I felt really good and felt like I was on track to doing what I really wanted to do in life. But anyway I went off to a small college in Missouri and less than a month into college I went through something super traumatic that my friends (term used loosely) basically set me up in and let it happen. Since then I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I have always struggled with anxiety, depression, and OCD, but ever since then everything has just gotten so, so much worse. I went from being valedictorian of my class in high school to failing a class my first semester and not being able to keep an A my entire first year of college. I know people say you shouldn't compare high school coursework to college coursework because it is harder but it really does just make me feel like I’m really setting myself up for failure. None of my family knows what happened and I have basically no friends anymore because everyone stopped talking to me after I got so depressed and the one person that i would've called my best friend (was not there when incident happened) told me that what happened was my own fault and she didn't want to deal with me anymore and ghosted me. I have two friends that I talk to pretty consistently and they genuinely have tried helping me through everything but I'm just feel like they don't get it enough to even help me and that makes me feel extremely guilty.

I don't want to expect that they should listen because I know it's probably hard to hear nothing but negativity from me all the time and I don't want them to feel pressured into hearing it because the last thing I would ever want to do is make them upset.

Here's the situation: Yesterday, my parents found out that I changed my name and wanted to become a girl. They sat down with me and launched into a huge lecture about how LGBTQ+ people are all delusional, that I only think this because I have ""too much time to think"", that being LGBTQ+ was going to lead me down a path that ends with drug abuse and AIDS, and that all of my current problems and anxiety were because I strayed from religion. Not only are they forcing me to act like a boy and become religious, they are also not allowing me to pursue my major of choice at a college that I have already applied for (I was in their honors program too) because they are ""worried about the friends I'll make"".

I tried to overdose on Advil because of this (I only had a mild stomachache to show for it).

I feel like seriously killing myself, something I hadn't felt for years, and that I am only going to become a bigger threat to myself as time goes on.

All of my ambitions seem impossible and I'm kind of numb about my passions.,1,1.0,2024-06-11 03:00:02,"My biggest ambition above all else is to have a wife who loves and respects me for me. The woman I was with for some time showed me neither of those were ever present from her.

My next ambition was to succeed at starting a business. Even if it failed, successfully start one. Had the business registered, had distribution set up, software in place, and was set to give the manufacturer the green light to ship us the first 10 units. But, with the depression and corresponding alcoholism from the breakup I had to put a pause on things. Which is essentially the graveyard for startups.

If I couldn't be successful at business with my ideas, I could at least create them. Collecting royalties on patent work could keep me afloat and getting to create new ideas has always been my dream (only behind a loving wife who respects me). I successfully was granted a patent, of a technology my business was going to leverage.

But, in the past, I used to have passion about new ideas. I'd work on one, then move on to the next if the first proved futile. I don't like to bring it up too much, but, I have Aspergers. So, when I hyper fixated on something I was spending weeks forgetting to eat or leave the house because of some new idea. The last handful of years and especially recently I haven't gotten passionate about any project. I'll work on something and get interested in it. But, my eyes won't light up when I talk about it.

Women have told me I'm attractive and sweet and well put together, so, my last resort was to just give up and seek comfort in the hollow love I can receive by becoming a womanizer. I studied up on what they do and how they do it, spent a couple months figuring out how I personally could go about having someone to hold for the night, then set it into practice. End of story, I blew through money on drinks for months and proved to myself I am abysmal at speaking to anyone in a casual manner.

I have failed my first three ambitions and couldn't succeed at the ambition I settled for after them. My depression is running rampant in a cycle that worsens itself as the only way to silence the suicidal ideation is with alcohol, which of course makes the depression worse.

Before I begin I just wanna say that English is my second language so there might be some grammatical mistakes here and there. This might be long so bear with me.
So my problem began over 2 months ago and it's been making me crazy. Over 2 months ago I heard this bizarre story on YouTube through a story narration channel. You know those channels where they use AI voice to read stories that are written in reddit formats. With the #s for algorithm and no source provided of the original author. Anyways when I found this particular story my gut kept telling me not to view it but curiosity got the better of me and I did and well, it went down hill.
Firstly, I started looking for the source of this story and saw that it was nowhere on Reddit or any other platform. Nobody in the comments could provide a link or confirm if the story ever existed on Reddit. Now, I'm 100% sure the story is fake and was never on Reddit. It has a lot of inconsistencys and plot holes and the premise itself is bizarre. But the problem was that I became obsessed with it. To the point I sort manifested myself as the main character. I started to feel their emotions which were heartbreak, pain, anxiety, betrayal etc. all of these emotions are overwhelming me and I'm sick of it. I wake up in the morning sad and I often get triggers. I picture some of the characters in people around me. And it makes things worse. Even in the last few weeks I was able to thin it down and get over it a bit but my mind keeps relapsing and in the last couple of days it has become hard. I came here because I was very overwhelmed and didn't know what to do.

Now let me give a brief about the story in question. It is a story about a guy who's girlfriend suddenly dissapeard and 5 years later he found out that she had ran off with his brother to Canada and had started a family and his own family( parents, relative's) knew about it and kept it a secret. I know a bizarre plot but the story has a lot of problems such as it has very little relationship dynamics, it has a lot of details missing line the OP never mentioned the comments because if it was a real post people would have asked a lot of questions and the story ends on a weird note which just creates a lot of questions. I don't know why I became obsessed with it because I've red worser stories than this but somehow I became.

Anyways I came to this sub asking for help and will appreciate any help that anybody provide. And also can anybody please help me confirm me that the story titled ""My Girlfriend Disappeared right before my Proposal And 5 Years Later I Find Out She Ran of with my brother"" to see if it's real or not and if it was ever on Reddit? It will help me out a lot. Apparently it was on aita.

Struggling with Severe OCD Episode,3,1.0,2024-06-10 20:09:54,"Hey everyone,

I'm really struggling right now and I need help. I'm trying to get control of my mind, but I don't know what to do. I'm currently experiencing a very severe episode of OCD, and it's affecting me every single waking second. I constantly make specific predictions about things happening, and if they do happen, I take it as a sign. It's driving me crazy and I don't feel safe anywhere.

For example, when I was at the mall, I kept thinking, ""If I walk by this store and this happens, if my phone rings now, if my phone randomly shuts off, if this store has a light flicker,"" and so on. I can't be anywhere without worrying that something specific will happen, and when it does, it just reinforces my fears.

Every second, I'm making dozens of predictions and I can't focus on anything.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. How do I stop this? I'm freaking out and need some advice or support.

He says hes so fed up with life, and hes completely given up, he just puts up an act everyday.

Looking for specific advice on triggers and intrusive thoughts,1,1.0,2024-06-11 00:10:30,"Hello,

I've written here a few times but never really received a reply to anything, but I'd like to give this one more go.

I have, for three straight months now, been experiencing trauma symptoms. I believe this was triggered by a procedure called a flexible cystoscopy, which to summarize is a camera being fed up the urethra in order to check the bladder. I was both humiliated (I didn't want the tech nor the assistant there but I felt compelled to try to grin and bear it anyway) and the doctor actually injured me during the procedure in such a way that took months to heal.

It's getting better on its own now, but I spent the better part of three months unable to sleep properly, eat properly, or do much of anything without experiencing flashbacks. I had pain in my bladder and prostate that constantly reminded me and I have felt nauseous to the point of frequently vomiting and I couldn't ever feel clean, no matter how many times I washed I felt like my skin was crawling.

I have been looking for a therapist, or hell, even a hotline to call about this. My life is otherwise going great for the first time in decades, but if I can't get through this I genuinely don't know what's going to happen. I just took a long weekend but I need to go back to work on Wednesday, and right now I would rather just not wake up at all.

Enabling vs helping,2,1.0,2024-06-10 20:12:58,"Cw!:Executive dysfunction, depression, anxiety

Hello, I am a person with audhd, depression, anxiety and I have a partner who suffered from the same things for sure but unfortunately not diagnosed. He just has the same brain as me but since I take meds I'm able to function just a tiny bit better... 

I was wondering how I could support him while he's facing executive dysfunction with enabling him to get used to not doing stuff or ending up with bad consequences? 

He has extremely bad executive dysfunction and cannot work or really do much because he is in a state of mental paralysis. But he really wants to work it's just really painful to the point of breakdowns everyday. 

I want him to be able to reach out or help and work but I'm not sure how to encourage him to a more healthy lifestyle (when I'm also pretty unhealthy..) I want to be there for him but at the same time I'm afraid I'm causing him to feel like there aren't negative consequences (even though he definitely knows and reminds himself every second)... 

Any suggestions etc would be appreciated!

I developed depression, c-ptsd, anxiety and OCD, which affected my self esteem and confidence. Right now my family dont give a fuck about me because i cant provide them money bcs of my issues (my dad passed away and im the eldest son in the family) and i dont have any friends at all. Because of those issues, i started using drugs (im done using now thankfully) .Luckily for me, there is still one good thing going on about my life which is my girlfriend ( although she was one of the main reasons of me having mental issues in the first place, its complicated, ill explain if you guys are interested in knowing why) She has been supporting me financially in the last 3 years, after my family kicked me out of the house. But because of this, i feel like im a worthless, waste of oxygen, even more than before. Ive thought of ending my life a few times. If it wasn't because of her and my faith, i wouldve been gone a long time ago. The most ive worked and stayed on a job is three months, and ive always ran away, bailed out, quit, ditched the job, whatever you wanna call it, in the end. I also tried to ditch and leave my girlfriend a few times, because i love her so much and i feel like she deserves way better than a worthless piece of shit like me, but she always stayed no matter what i do. She also offered me to go to therapy, but there is no way i would agree to burdens her even more than i already did and still doing to this day, plus her income is only enough for her commitments and needs/wants, and therapy costs SO MUCH in this country, since mental health awareness is basically non existent among people here (if you have one, 90% of them would just quickly assume youre abusing drugs). I just want to hold a job, so that one day i could pay her back, but i just cant seem to find a motivation to hold onto or when i do, it just doesnt seem worth it. When i do hold to that momentarily, there will always be, ALWAYS BE something that will prevent me from holding a job , for example, like toxic work environment (this is the most common thing that happenend to me on the job, bcs of mental health awareness issue i was talking about), or even my mental illness, where they just made me lost the will to do anything at all.

I just don't know if this is the right call. I know my boyfriend would be much happier just telling them it's a myth and to not put anymore thought into it because it's pointless.

The most previous time it happened was when I was invited to a small gathering at my SIL’s and after a while, all of a sudden, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, and realized I started tearing up. I asked to go home immediately, even though nobody did nothing to make me uncomfortable. 

What confuses me is there are social occasions where I’d be just fine and having a good time. Several times would be like this.

Is it wrong that I'm hurt that my mom wants another baby now that I'm almost an adult?,1,0.99,2024-06-10 21:42:26,"For the past two years my parents (mom and step-dad) have been trying for a baby endlessly. My mom has expressed how much she would love another child, but due to older age, health issues, and immense stress, she has miscarried multiple times. It has destroyed her mentally, her last miscarriage was around the beginning of last year, and despite the constant devastation of not being able to carry another child, she continues trying. 

She has alluded a couple times that having this new baby would allow her to start over as a mother. She wasn't the greatest mom to me when I was young, and to this day she still isn't the best. I won't get into it, other than that I will never have a healthy normal attachment to any person for the rest of my life. She is aware of this.

I feel like if she truly has this baby, that when I finally leave the house and start my own life, that baby will be my replacement. *That* will be her clean slate. She believes she's too far gone with the shit she did to me, and there's absolutely no way to fix things between us. Instead of, you know, being better, but whatever. She doesn't want another child to fill their world with love and light and create a wonderful person, she wants the confirmation that she's not a bad mom by raising someone else and making them better than me.

It hurts, that she would rather put herself through the pain and devastation of miscarrying one after the other, destroy herself mentally and emotionally, for the miniscule chance of having a new baby, than truly fix things with me. She would rather endlessly face the fact that her God refuses to grant her the gift of giving life, than face me.

"Have you ever had the urge to bite someone, smack someone, or hit someone after constant shitty behavior?",1,0.67,2024-06-10 21:09:31,"I live an... interesting life. It's not awful by any means, but I feel as if I am being constantly prodded, provoked, and bothered. Not all of it is purposeful, some of it is just odd behavior by people. For example, one thing that has recently highly annoyed me is going through a bad time, and then listening to a relative who was there with me recount that experience via a phone call ... very loudly. The loudness isn't the issue. The issue is that the situation completely changed in the context of a phone call with someone else. Said relative LIED about half the things that happened, and revealed new information to the person on the phone that was not disclosed to me.

I don't know why, but I have the urge to bite them over the lies. An urge I know I cannot act on, but like god damn, all the strange behavior has me under extreme tension. I have no idea if that is how humans act, and I am unjustly freaking out... or if that is bizzare and not normal human behavior... and I am rightly uncomfortable and stressed.

I can describe my anger as the following: I find my jaw clamping down very strongly, and I tense all my muscles and fists. I then have a fake mental fight with said person where I take a big ol' chomp out of their arm out of principle. Then after my fake mental fight, I kind of feel justified and start to settle down. Kind of imagining giving someone an ass-kicking is my go-to relief lately. Kind of like those fake shower arguements some people have with themselves.

The issue is that I feel pushed just a *tiny* bit farther every time (when having a legitimate confrontation with the person), and I don't wanna snap. Everyone has that point where they go ""that does it"" and they do something unimaginable wacky. Whether that be walking away and never coming back, going crazy, or getting out the cast-iron frying pan and dishing out an ""abusive father level ass kicking"".

I feel like for me, my current solution is suppressing all the bad feelings, smiling and waving for one or two more years, and then finally being set up for the permanent leave when I can finally go and be around people I want to be around.

"have been lying to my psychiatrist about my real issues because i’m scared, what do i do?",1,1.0,2024-06-10 20:48:06,"I’m nervous about posting this because truly at this point I have nobody to talk to regarding this that I think may understand? So..I will try to explain everything to the best to my ability. I [18F] have been diagnosed with AD(H)D, an unspecified anxiety disorder & depression, BUT this is only because my parents just wanted me to get a 504 help plan in school because I can’t focus, so that’s why they got the psychiatrist in the first place. 

But this is where it started getting worse, I know I have more issues than this, but i’m horrified to get help. Before I started seeing this psychiatrist, she met with my parents and they filled out a form with characteristics I met, and I asked my sister about it when they showed it to her and she had told me that they had lied on portions of it relating to more problems because they only wanted an ADHD diagnosis (such as possibly having autism, suicidal ideation, blah blah blah)

Our meetings have been normal because my psychiatrist just wants me to finish school which is why I’m seeing her, but I want to tell her my real issues like the things that have been going on at home. My mom is a huge alcoholic and drug addict, and it gets really bad on a nightly basis; she screams and screams and nobody does anything and we can’t get her help even though we’ve tried. She has constantly abused me emotionally and mentally, mostly due to the fact I’m behind in credits for school, I don’t have my license yet (working on it now that it’s summer) and the fact I have a girlfriend. My sister recently cut me off too because of my moms actions, so I can’t talk to her about all these things. I do have really bad issues with self-harming to cope with these things in my life or I punish myself to go without sleep. 

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist later today, but I’m so scared of telling her about these things, specifically the self-harming & asking for pills that work? Because she has prescribed me anxiety pills that are only meant to be used in emergency situations, but I’ve gone through them because it’s everyday that I have panic attacks at this point and I truly don’t know if I’m even capable of being helped as I have been deemed as a failure by everyone in my life. I feel so horrible and guilty that I’ve lied to her about everything being fine when it’s not, I don’t want her to think i’m crazy or even send me to an inpatient facility because my mom has convinced me that’s what’s gonna happen and that my issues aren’t as bad as hers. 

I plan to tell her today but I know i will break down so very bad in her office, i’m scared that i will look like an attention seeker, but I hate feeling the way I have been every single day. Moving out isn’t an option, living with anyone else isn’t either, I’ve talked to my dad about my moms issues but he doesn’t understand her and lets her get away with all of this stuff because she is very disabled.

Grounding? Struggling to keep going.,1,1.0,2024-06-10 20:37:51,"Hello all,

I suffer from general anxiety and clinical depression (have been on medication for 32 years) and am going through a really bad depressive and anxiety episode at present. This is not my first episode.

I have access to a psychologist via work and she has advised to use grounding techniques when the bad / intrusive / suicidal thoughts occur.

However, I'm struggling to find one which works. 
I've tried the 3-3-3 and 5-4-3-2-1 techniques but I am still thinking the other thoughts while doing these.
I only find it takes me a few seconds to complete these and then the bad thoughts continue.

She suggested touching something physical e.g wedding ring but doesn't help either.

I've tried mindfulness but I cannot find 'now' 

Whether I am doing something wrong or I am utterly useless (more likely the case)

Today started as being very  anxious without being able to feel why. I've been going downhill to rock bottom since.

I thought I was doing better as I had 3 consecutive days without suicidal thoughts.

My psychologist wants to try EMDR but I can't  remember any trauma and have no reason to believe there is any. I have no reason to believe that my childhood wasn't generally happy. Therefore would EMDR work.

I have tried CBT several times but it never seems to work for me. I am a generally logical but the same logic that I would apply to others doesn't apply to me. I feel I am not worthy of it and am worthless, useless and a waste of space.

Both my parents are wealthy and working as doctors.

I wasted a lot of their money in my studies (16 000 €)<---(And now I feel like a clown and guilty :-| ).

I never worked (neither in school nor for money) because I never needed to and I failed to learn to work/learn in less than 2 years.

I feel like a disappointment to my family, and I feel like it's rightfully so.

I have no experience, no diploma in a country where diplomas are the basis of all jobs.

I got kicked out by my mom "" for both of our well being"" and I live at my father's home

And i am getting pressured to work by my father ... Or ill get kicked out eventually

I isolated myself to an extreme degree, due to feeling bad and not wanting for anyone to worry.

I forgot how to socialise and can't handle shame/awkwardness, not even in movies (I flee).

I feel like all tasks are hard, each more than the other even showering is bothersome, i always feel like sleeping.

Even though I was educated to see the half full cup i only see the half empty one.

I hate myself, I fear myself.

I am scared of everything and everyone. And I walled myself in that.

I feel like I am drowning in anxiety and in doubt

I feel dull about everything ... nothing feels significant ...

I had a relapse of mental breakdown last Saturday ... Somehow I abandoned all hope while having it ... I wanted to let myself drift away ...

I had suicidal thoughts >!(and I devised a few plans to kill myself)!< and then i talked to a friend for 8h and he convinced me not to execute the plans and gave me help, but now I don't want to monopolise his attention or disrupt him, he is not an IRL friend and I felt and still feel lonely . (And my ""bad me"" thinks it's deserved)

Then i reached out to a help chat online which told me to talk to a doctor ...

I found the strength to talk about it to my dad and he answered with a "" I am happy you are not feeling well mentaly with how dire your situation is ! "" (talk of a mental support)

I contacted a psychologist ... i am seeing him later this week .

I feel extremely anxious and guilty of feeling all that. And I feel like i have no redeeming quality .

I don't have any more suicidal thoughs but scarily enough i don't feel fear for death ?

Everything is just empty ? Usually I am extremely sensitive and i have a hard time figuring out my emotions but i just feel EMPTY ?

"Can Grief Cause a Breakup? Seeking Advice on Navigating My Relationship While Grieving
",1,1.0,2024-06-10 19:21:54,"Hey Reddit,

I’m a 21-year-old in a two-year relationship, and I could really use some advice or opinions on my situation. To give some context:

In May of last year, I lost my dad, and it's been incredibly tough. My girlfriend has been there for me through everything, and I genuinely don't know where I'd be without her support. However, we have some compatibility issues that seem to be getting worse. She has an anxious attachment style and needs a lot of closeness and reassurance, while I have an avoidant attachment style and tend to pull away, especially when I'm overwhelmed or need time alone. This dynamic has caused friction between us in the past.

About a month ago, things came to a head, and we decided to take a two-week no-contact break because our issues were becoming too much to handle. During that time, I tried to focus on grieving, spending time with friends and family, and engaging in hobbies to distract myself.

When we reconnected after the break, we both expressed our desire to make things work and reaffirmed our love for each other. I was honest with her that even though it's been over a year since my dad passed, I’m still not in the right emotional headspace. I told her that I wouldn’t be able to give as much effort to our relationship as I did before my dad died—maybe only 20-30% compared to before—and she agreed to try to work through it together.

Now, a month later, the same issues have resurfaced. I’m feeling overwhelmed again and unsure what to do. Should we consider taking more time apart for me to heal? Is there something I can do to better balance my need for space and her need for closeness? I’m struggling to meet the expectations I set for our relationship before my dad died, and I’m worried this might be affecting us more than I can manage. I also worry that us continuing this will just lead us right back here since we were just here about a month ago. I also feel like she doesnt understand me and my grief or why I might feel the way I do.

Has anyone been through something similar? Can grief really be a factor in a breakup? How did you navigate your relationship while dealing with significant loss? Any advice or insight would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading and for any help you can offer.

TL;DR: Lost my dad a year ago and still struggling emotionally. My girlfriend and I have different attachment styles, causing friction. After a two-week break, we’re trying to make it work, but the same issues are resurfacing. Seeking advice on whether to take more time apart or how to balance our needs.

Hallucinations at night are getting worse,1,1.0,2024-06-10 19:19:43,"I actually don't think there is anything to do about this. Maybe this is more like venting, but I feel like I need some sort of support rather than shouting out problems.

I've always suffered from seeing hallucinations at night. I only recently learned that they are called hypnopompic hallucinations, which is ironic since i first remember experiencing them in the nineties. Should have looked in to them more earlier in my life, but they come and go. Some periods are more intense, sometimes they can disappear for months at a time.

I'm not a drinker, don't take any drugs and would call myself healthy otherwise. 

A typical ""session"" is that I wake up in the middle of the night, and see insects. We're talking big bugs, the size of your palm, crawling around in the room. I can see them as clearly as day, and there is no doubt in my mind **they are not real**, but they seem real enough for me to get a elevated heartbeat and worry my wife each time it happens.

For anyone wondering what it's like waking up tired in the night, and suddenly see 10 centimeter big cockroaches crawling in your bed, I can tell you it's not that much of a walk in the park. Note that I do not have a phobia against bugs.

I've gotten used to these sessions though, but the last two weeks the hallucinations have been getting progressivly worse. It's not only creepy crawlers, it's rodents and bats. And it's not only seeing them anymore, now I can also feel them. Havn't experienced that since childhood.

Last night i was barely awake, when I saw a bat flying trough the bedroom and land on my hand. This time i felt it crawl briefly on me with it's claws before I shooed it away, and it landed by the window.

I was so convinced it was real that I got up and got a big bowl from the kitchen to catch it. Surprise, it was not there when I got back. Never was. Good luck falling asleep again.

I don't want to burden my wife with these hallucinations getting worse, she has enough to think about anyway. And I know the hallucinations are not dangerous. But they *are* starting to affect my sleep more severely than ever, which triggers them to occur even more often.

Propably just need to vent Guess the flair is wrong, but I also feel like I need a good tap on the back with a ""*It will be allright*"".

"my friends betrayed me, again ",1,1.0,2024-06-10 18:53:32,"
So about 3-4 months ago my boyfriend broke up with me and it broke me compleatly, I became suicidal and my addiction to self harm returned. For the first month I was texting with a few of my friends about what's happening and how I'm doing and then on my last phone call with my ex he told me that he's getting information from my friends about what I say about him. That was the second time that I was ready to commit suicide after the break up. I felt betrayed beyond belief. It's been like two months from this situation and clearly all the people around me were done with the topic of my ex so I found shtwt where I was just posting my thoughts and it helped me, because even if I didn't get any feedback I was able to put it into the world without knowing that I'm making people that I care about feel bad. And yesterday I posted on shtwt that I was feeling suicidal, but when I got it out of my chest I deleted it and went to sleep so I wouldn't do anything stupid. My sister woke me up and our mom told us that someone called the police, I thought it was my friend because I deleted messages about my other friend working with my ex and she knew that it made me feel horrible. Turned out that it was also for that reason, but the biggest reason was because they saw what I posted on shtwt and sent it to the police. The police forced me to go to the hospital even tho I refused and so did my mom, there the doctor said that she doesn't see a reason for  hospitalization and also said what I said to the police, that the hospital won't help me. so I went home and had a pretty heated conversation with my friend and she reveled that she and that other friend were basically stalking me on twt and that they used it to control how I was feeling. I tweeted many times that I'm suicidal and none of them texted me once about it. I feel like they're treating me like a number that can't dissappear because they'll feel bad and that they just forgot that I'm human and that I'm hurting. I feel even more alone than I did before and now I'm not getting any response from either of them, I'm just so tired.

not depressed (?) but have to force myself to do things I enjoy? [any ideas/keywords for what it could be?] ,1,1.0,2024-06-10 18:50:15,"**context:** 23F, psychiatrist sessions every 1-2 months, diagnosed with a mild depressive episode, medicated

\_

RN I feel like I have to fight my own brain every day to do things I end up enjoying.

Usually this just results in me doing ""lazy"" things (laying with cats, playing easy/comfy games), or in ""brain-dead"" tasks like cleaning.

But it causes problems with my job (late to work, tempted to skip). But I don't... hate my job? I love my team and I don't mind most of my tasks.

A higher dosage (triple) of my medication didn't help with this either.

\_

Other notes/thoughts from my end:

* To me, it sounds like some form of executive dysfunction.
* I don't think I match the ADHD criteria.
* I also doubt it is bipolar, because neither my moods nor their swings seem intense enough.
* Cognitive function is good (tested during psychological evaluation)
* Impulsive tendencies (want to do things I think of right away)

I can deal with forcing myself to make a call, but forcing myself to get out of bed the majority of my days is just too much.

So if anyone has any input for me, it would be greatly appreciated!

Ofc I'll bring all of this up to my psychiatrist next session, but I'd be happy if I can find some leads \^\^ (and also I had the impulse to do something about it *now* lmao so here I am)",mentalhealth,vika-hime,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dct83m/not_depressed_but_have_to_force_myself_to_do/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06
Uncontrollable rage/anger after watching porn/playing games.,2,0.75,2024-06-10 14:51:51,"
My last few outbursts have gotten really bad, my anger has always been a problem since I was a kid, I had a habit of breaking my electronics for stupid reasons but I feel like it has developed into something more serious. 

With today, my reaction was really frightening after watching porn, first I started punching my shelves beside my desk, after that I moved to the bathroom to clean up where I punched the door twice, punched the door again to the bathroom door, I tried to calm myself down but failed and raced into my room, I started throwing/punching/kicking anything I could find even going as far as hitting myself.



Then after all that, I sat down on my bed and starting crying, I really don't understand where this anger is coming from.  My anger has never been directed at other people so I know I am not a danger to anyone, but the fact that I have reacted like this today and in the past is really starting to scare me.

Parents constantly remind me of how ugly i am,1,1.0,2024-06-10 18:29:19,"Last 3 days ago, my parents made fun of me by saying how ‘pretty’ i am in a sarcastic manner. At first, i’m just brushing it off not until my dad told me how my acne scars resemble a map. This is when i started to lose it, and told them that i’m ugly because they were too—that i got it from their genes. For reference, i know to myself that i’m not conventionally pretty—i’m short, i’m fat, have acne scars and have too many imperfections. But when i fix myself, i know that i look decent. I also take care of myself (salons, facials, etc…) and most of the time they tell me that i should become beautiful by the end since all of these sessions are expensive (they both laugh while telling me this).

3 days have passed and i’m still giving them silent treatment, and it feels so heavy. I have trouble sleeping even though i’m taking melatonin. I love them but i just can’t ignore the fact that they didn’t respect my boundaries.

I am currently with a new partner of 3 years now. At the beginning of the relationship he told me all about past relationships and sexual experiences. I constantly obsess over it with occasional breaks of obsession. I’ve told him about it and he’s been awesome at trying to help but there’s obviously not much he can do. As of right now, we are planning a trip to Cali and all I can think about is how he had a sexual encounter with a waitress in Florida (before we met).

Whether you did green to gold on your first 4 year contract and did 16 years as an officer and become a chaplain and are still serving, wondering what it'll be like when you finally have to retire.

I'm not sure about the National Guard or Reserves but I know you did basic training and you did advanced training. That is where much of the trauma lies. And they are introducing more holistic and wellness practices into basic and ait, "" "" , to mitigate the extent of the mental health damage a lot of us have already before joining, which is why we joined in the first place. We didn't play nice with others and always knew we were destined for something greater.

I say all of that to sort of touch on some real life matters that bring all of us together as Veterans. We are not fighting for our benefits but for our identity. I don't identify as a proud person or a shameful person but a tough SOB and I know that being vulnerable is the toughest thing anyone can do.

And I'm living through the invasion of Ukraine with personal connections and am currently 90% going for TDIU. I was 80% from active duty because I cleared the base at JBLM.

My friends ETSd with no medical record hard copy. Some of.them never saw a VSO and are struggling now. I meet veterans on the street just hoping for help. When the government has 516 billion dollars in VA money why are they so afraid to use it on veterans? I'm hearing about claims taking 10 years. How about they pay us thinking we are innocent and if we end up lying we owe the money? 

I'm tired of thinking veterans are treated worse than criminals. Guilty for benefits until proven innocent. I've seen reenactments of Vietnam vets. They talk about seeing all of their friends murdered, and so they go in at night and start shooting up villages and come home and dream about being able to make amends to the daughters. But they wake up to reality.

I did 4 years but I'm a very sensitive person. My mom died when I was 6, I was in a group home, my dad died when I was 19. I was abused by my aunt.and uncle, and my group home was pretty violent. 

Mother fucker I'm so happy to have NY benefits. It's like winning the lottery. But it's been 2.75 years since I ETSd and less time since I got med boarded after that and I feel like 10 years has passed. My memory is fucked, people are afraid of me, I'm not in touch with reality.

The Wellbutrin has done very little for my adhd. I actually feel like I have a lot of energy but very little motivation/focus. It’s caused minor memory loss…My ocd is bad.

How do you fight a victim mentality?,1,1.0,2024-06-10 16:14:47,"I've gone through a lot, that much is for sure, and I don't want to invalidate that by any of what I'm about to say.

However, nowadays I can't seem to see the positives in any situation and always feel like bad things are happening to me. There are good things, I'm not the worst off, and I can rationalize all of that, but it does *nothing* to stop how I feel, and I'm on a pretty steep downhill slope right now that's leaving me feeling very depressed and hopeless and verging on dark thoughts I've been fighting off for a long, long time. 

For example, I presently have huge housing issues, which has been a running theme for 10 years based on nothing other than bad luck, really. I'm financially OK-ish, but I've had a horrid run of awful rental environments (including one where sewage was infiltrating my basement, causing not only structural issues but also black mold and flies, all of which led to me losing hair from stress!) that just seems to keep going. I find it really hard not to look at this situation and not think I'm either being targeted, that I'm somehow deserving of it, or that there's no hope of me ever being happy. 

People keep telling me not to think that way, that it's just bad luck or a sign of the times or whatever, but it's not helping. I'm sinking further and further into this feeling that I'm basically destined to live miserably forever, and quite frankly I'm running out of energy if that's the case.

I’m a 25F working adult, and have been working under a company sponsored visa for 6 months now.. i feel trapped and powerless.

For context, i cannot stand to live with my family, and looked for overseas job. This was the only one who offered me visa, albeit i got extremely lowballed, but i was also extremely desperate.

I thought this job will be decent, but unfortunately i’ve found myself hating it more and more because it wasn’t what i expected. The commute is long, i can’t feel the growth from the job, and the management people is disgustingly controlling for my field. It has come to the point that every time I’m commuting, i legitimately wishes something happens and i won’t have to go to work for a while, maybe forever tbh.

Switching a job is difficult, work visa process and bureaucracy is a nightmare and idk if the opportunity will present itself anytime soon. 

I just don’t feel like the luck is ever on my side, and i’ve been going thru hardships again and again about this. I’m so jealous at people who can job hop without consequences..

I feel conflicted. Of course i’m glad for the visa allowing i can stay independently, and i have a loving partner that i don’t have to LDR anymore. But at the same time, i have intense anxiety and depression on the weekdays i have to go to work.

Am I just way too sensitive? Do I overthink?,3,1.0,2024-06-10 09:33:37,"Preface: No big event happened. I still felt terrible all day. I've been like this for years.

I have been friends with a girl around my age (20 yo, I'm 21) since november last year. We go to uni together and have grown very close quickly, to the point we text every day and hang out often.

Details: >! Over the time we spent together I absolutely cherished her friendship. I rarely feel compatibility like this when I'm with someone, to the point I have developed romantic feelings. It was a very slow burn, admittedly with me pushing back on any love to avoid compromising what we already have. !<

Recently I spoke to some friends about my romantic interest in her and they insisted I should give it a shot, so I did. I didn't tell her straight up, but I started showing more interest, some flirting wich she sometimes reciprocated and, for a few days, goodnight/good morning texts.

I figured she'd appreciate them. She never replied with much emotion, but didn't seem bothered either. Two days ago, I sent the text and she replied the following day, after leaving it on read, with a random sticker.

She's not supposed to reply in a specific way or right away. She doesn't owe me a reply either. She didn't really say anything about it. Nothing really happened. But yesterday I felt completely depressed, cried for the first time in years. I felt like that was her telling me she's uncomfortable with that and that I just imagined any romantic hint I might have picked up on. The sticker is really an excuse for not replying, or so I think.

This happened yesterday, but I've been like this for years. Whenever I step into anything regarding love I crumble in the wind. Never been in a relationship mostly because of this. I'm normally not very sensitive.

Is this normal? I'm concerned with how easily my mood drops. She didn't really do a thing, but I'm reading a lot into that and pretty much creating problems in my mind. Am I right in doing that?

My sister hates my (depression?) room and criticizes it every visit,1,1.0,2024-06-10 15:22:26,"To expand on my title, my room is messy yes but I work hard in cleaning it. I vacuum all the hair and dust (that accumulates very fast) once or twice every week, I change my sheets weekly and yes sometimes the plates of old dishes or cups overstay their welcome for 2 days or so, along with empty plastic bottles. My desk though is a little cluttered, with little trinkets and my school work and papers, hair ties and random daily use objects. 

When a mess occurs, I do not feel nor do I think that I have to clean it up immediately or take care of it in some way. It isn’t my priority, it does not bother me, but it bothers other people; which bothers me. I have depression, as well as frequent thoughts of suicide and I really do my best to manage and cope with them, trying to take care of myself and my appearance, maintain my relationships and even to do a daily routine. I know mental health can affect a person’s room, and I want to have a clean room, it is just a preference so I clean my room in the standard that I think is clean.

All of those things I mentioned above are very mentally tiring to do and to maintain despite being basic things in life. 

My sister doesn’t seem to understand though, I think. She’s in her mid-twenties and I am in my teens. Every time she comes over, she criticizes my room and mentions the strands of hair on the floor (I try to vacuum them everyday since my hair falls often), the papers, my cluttered desk, empty water bottles. Even if my pants that were on the floor (due to me rushing to change for dinner) had her saying “Disgusting.”

Some days (when I freshly clean my room and no mess has accumulated), I have no trash, no dishes, very little water bottles, a clean floor, slightly messy table but just a singular shoe box in the middle of my room and she would criticize and berate me for the shoe box. 

It hurts my feelings deeply in the moment, but later on the feeling goes away but it makes me scared to let people into my room or seeing my room.

Just a few minutes ago she told me “Do you know a few people have even asked me to teach you at how to clean your room? It’s embarrassing for me, you know?” and it hurt me. 

She’s aware that I have suicidal thoughts, and that I have depression. I’ve opened up to her about how I even find it very hard to even do the most basic tasks, so I do not know why she says these things. Maybe I am a kid to her and seem lazy or careless, I don’t know. We are on good terms and are close, but moments like these make me feel insecure and alone.

Any thoughts or opinions? I don’t necessarily need to know who is in the wrong. Should I clean my room more deeply and care for it more? I don’t mind doing so, but it is not a priority as I think handling my emotions and thoughts comes first daily. 

I’m open for criticism also, I just want a better understanding of the situation and my sister, as well as how I should proceed.",mentalhealth,Strong_Reception_134,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dco4z4/my_sister_hates_my_depression_room_and_criticizes/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06

So we broke up. I broke up with her, neither of us were very happy. Her family had been going through some stuff ( Her dad had cheated on her mum) and I had been coughing up blood and been in and out of hospital which I then later found out was Tuberculosis.

Meditation works - it just takes a while ,1,0.66,2024-06-10 15:09:46,"I've struggled with depression, anxiety and SH for a long time. Of course, therapy and medication can work really well if you get the right match. I unfortunately never found that. I've tried meditating before, but it really didn't help and made me even more anxious so I stopped. 

But recently I tried again - there's a video by HealthyGamerGG that breaks down how meditation affects you in the short and long term. It made me reconsider the practice. 

I'm just sharing my observations of my own experience. Before, I would do 10-minute guided meditations that really didn't help much. But this time, I tried going longer, roughly 20-30 minutes. I tried a couple of different types of meditation, one of them being a guided approach, the other a breathing exercise. 

By doing it longer for each session and not expecting immediate results, I found myself much more aware of my own predicaments, reducing my impulsiveness, being more comfortable with myself instead of reaching for distractions. And I'm slowly realizing things about myself that I never had the space in my mind to see before. It's definitely not useless. 

So if it's something you feel might help you, I'd suggest thinking of it like going to the gym.

I told him from first day on that I am not the typical girl, and that i often get misgendered what i kind of like. I even told him that my best friend called me ""Jamie"" sometimes even though my name is Lynn. He seemed to be okay with that. That i am non-binary 

He has a lot of ""red flags"" in his behaviour through to the psychologic problems that are reasoned by his past. His words are kind of hurtful sometimes but I accept him the way he is because I love him. 

Well yesterday we had a big fight after a friend of ours made a joke that he is eating again. My husband gained a little weight through to immobility, our friend on his side had cancer in his jaw which made him unable to eat (he has a feeding tube through the stomach now) 

so the last times something like that happened I explained my husband calmly that our friend meant no harm to him he is kind of sad and jealous that he can eat. Oh boy little did I know that my husband didn't see me as de-escalating he saw me as his enemy having an affair with our friend (which I definitely haven't and would never think about) 
Well I learnt my lesson and didn't say it this time, but it went down hill quite fast. He held a knife to his stomach and said he don't like his body and will cut it off. 

As I explained earlier I am as well are not happy with my body. So It has been enough, the whole situation was just overwhelming and I snapped, I told him that he knows I am as well not happy with me and asked him how he would feel if i would held a knife to my body parts i don't like.

How to deal with FOMO even for things you don't necessarily WANT to do?,1,1.0,2024-06-10 13:27:33,"So this might sound like a bit of a dumb thing to struggle with, but I've struggled with it for years and I feel like it's beginning to take over my life. Essentially, FOMO has got the better of me, to the point that I'll even talk myself into doing things I'm not really that interested in doing. 

For example, it might be something as small as going for a drink with friends after work, or something bigger like going to a music festival. The reasons for not going range from just being tired and wanting to go and collapse after work, to just having some bad experiences with attending music festivals in the past and not wanting to have to go through it again.

In my head, I know I should just say ""no, but thanks for the offer."" But I find it so difficult to accept that I might miss out on a funny moment, not be included in future plans, or that my friends might talk ill of me behind my back, that I end up caving and doing it anyway. I also argue that because I'm admittedly a bit more introverted and recharge my social battery by being on my own, making myself go out and go for drinks etc. is something I should do to push myself out of my comfort zone a little more.

It's reached the point where I've turned down going to see my partner's family for a weekend or going on holiday in fear of missing out on a single night out. 

I think there's probably some childhood trauma of bullying/ being left out playing a part here (for some reason, when I was younger I didn't get invited to some kid's pool party despite being in that friendship group). I know I've got insecurities, and I'm trying to just push through the FOMO and accept that it's going to happen. I hate how it makes me feel, but I hate knowing I'm missing out on living my own life and being there for other important people in my life. 

I know this probably reads a little jumbled and unclear, but that's how my head constantly feels nowadays and I think it's this chronic overthinking and FOMO that play the biggest part in it.

• I get a little crush on this fictional 2D character when I was ovulating and was during my finals so I was stressed in first week of May.  
• I read one fanfic smut and got so excited, horny and obsessed. That night I really wondered what Im doing with my life. 
• I started with questioning whether I really like my partner of 5 years, since I havent been so obsessed with him ever. I was in love with him but never obsessed. And I also had small doubts that I was happy to look over. I also had plans to move out after I turned 20 but since finances didnt work out, I stayed with dysfunctional family at the cost of my mental health. 
• Then I started regretting not moving out, not exploring more, not living my life to the fullest. If I'm actually physically attracted to my partner because I had never been this horny with them. I never wanted them as much as I wanted a fictional character. Things started Very gradually and suddenly. We decided to stay long term after dating for a year or so I had no plans otherwise. I just thought why not. But then I started having feelings. 
• After a week, the regrets stopped. But I began to find flaws in my partner. I felt like I was overlooking a lot of things, and whether I'm sure about him. 
• The last biggest hit was I stopped seeing a future, for myself at that. I began to think if there's any meaning in whatever I was running after. If I'd be better off im a fictional world like the one im in. 
• But the biggest problem has been with my partner since they are involved in my life. It was like a switch going off. I was repulsed by the idea of dating them, liking them. 
• I cant imagine myself with anyone anymore. I can't imagine chasing after anything/any achievement in this life. Im obsessively reading stuff related to that fiction. 
• I do feel sudden waves of emotion for my partner once a week. But then ut wears off sooner than it happened. I feel very distressed. Its been a month I still havent felt the way I did before all this happened.  
• I suddenly find no meaning in anything in life. i just want to be left alone. I dont know what I want to do honestly. I can function normally outside of the house and have all my life in place. But mentally Im absolutely devastated especially about my relationship. 
• I dont want to breakup because it felt right even couple of months ago what could go wrong? 
• Im still very sexually attracted to my partner. But I feel no love or obsession or attraction inside thar made me wanna be with them no matter what.

My healing journey ,2,1.0,2024-06-10 07:41:31,"My journey of healing from trauma has been a rough road. Recently I've been posting on Instagram and reddit about incidents that have happened to me over my 27 years of living. I battles with physical, verbal emocional and sexual abuse for years. I kept a lot bottled up for years in my attempt to ""not seem as I'd I was attention seeking."" A quote heavily thrown around my in my family towards my mental health struggles growing up. 

My last suicide attempt was in 2021, two years after I was sexually assauted. My assailant was dragging the court case along with continuance after continuance and I had finally grown so weak I could no longer take how utterly mentally exhausted I was. Clearly my attempt at taking my life did not work and I am so grateful it did not, however the reaction I was met with by my family was harsh and still haunts me to this day. My eldest sister posted on a comment of one of her Facebook quotes that I was ""one attention seeking suicide attempt away from losing my son.""
I know I will never see an apology from that woman. And I'm coming to terms with it. I've been doing a lot of introspection these past few months. Thinking about my childhood abuse and neglect and seeing how it has grown to affect me as an adult. Through therapy I have learned my toxic traits and what they mean and how they manifested themselves. 
My biggest toxic trait is that I don't seek help until it is often times too late. I sprial into the dark place and find myself scared to ask for help.
My other toxic trait is my love for validation. Seeking it out in anyway possible. I never knew that as an adult, it would grow into my wanting to have the last word sometimes until it was pointed out to me by my therapist. I was told it was because I was ""arrogant"" and ""egotistical."" But it's in my search of my opinion and needs being validated that I want the last word. Not to save a fragile ego. 
While I continue my journey, sharing my pain as a child, through social media, I feel it has helped me heal. Yes, I satisfy that toxic trait of validation, but I also get to tell my story. To get it off my chest. And I need that. I need to have my story heard, because what I've been put through was not right and I need to except it. I am proud to be shouting from the roof tops about injustice. It is my right. And I will continue it. I will continue to heal and end my suffering in the cycle of abuse that was my life.

I'm in my early 20s. Am I suffering from memory loss?,1,1.0,2024-06-10 11:25:03,"Hey guys sorry if this is the wrong forum to post this but just need some insight. So i'm in my  early 20s and I'm not sure if i'm suffering from some sort of memory loss. I've been thinking about this for awhile but just assumed maybe it was normal.

I've realised that if I think back to my past I can't remember almost anything up to a certain point. I have key memories mainly bad or associated with trauma that I still remember clearly and some happy memories but they're all disjointed, not in any particular order and are at various points in my life.

I can't really remember my school life or before until I was around 16. I graduated university 2 years ago and my memories of university are already fading, again I remember certain memories but can't tell you what I really did in the 3 years I was there.

I can't recall what I've done recently as in last week and also when I go out with friends or do something in my leisure time when I think back to what I've done at the end of the day it feels like I wasn't really there and I'm thinking back to a sort of dream where I'm just floating through it. I feel like i'm not really present in those moments, like I can be happy and having a good time or whatever but once i'm out of that situation I kinda forget what it's like to be there if that makes any sense. For example a lot of my memories with my best friend I don't really recall anymore, I went to go and see her a few months ago and I can only partially remmeber what we even did, talked about, etc

I also do suffer with depression and anxiety which I am medicated for if that can make any difference in these experiences. So anyway can someone offer any insight or answer to this.

It feels similar to that but the weather hasn't changed. I feels a touch dream-like or like dejavu but not.

I've had moments like this in the past, even as a child but it seemed to only last a few hours then.  It's now been a few days and it just feels like it's getting worse. It happened all of a sudden too, I stood up and walked across the room and when I looked back it just wasn't the same anymore.

I've been thinking a lot about my behavior towards other people over the last few weeks. I'm a people pleaser and it's really bothering me.

On the other hand, the associated overthinking and anxiety the day after is extremely exhausting. After a meeting (especially with people I don't know that well), I can't think about anything other than the fact that I've behaved strangely and they probably don't even like me anyway. I also sometimes hate myself because I know that I'm a people pleaser and always want to please everyone. 
Incidentally, I've been in therapy for a few years and am currently working on this very problem.

Eating 100grams of food a day,2,0.67,2024-06-10 07:04:53,"As above. 4 months ago I was at 94kg. Going to the gym everyday , eating as much as I could. 
I have never been a big eater and infact , I don't really enjoy food at all. I enjoy flavours but the actual eating I don't like. 

I don't have a negative body issue. But I do have. big problem trying to eat.

I had to change therapist from 6 years ago because she insists in being my friend,3,1.0,2024-06-10 04:48:45,"I (37F) had this former friend who had a lot of mental issues and witneseed her suferring for long time. Suddendly i saw she was getting better and better and even got a job and began studying a new career! I was so happy for her. I asked what helped and she told me she found an amazing therapist. She recommended me with her, and it actually worked for me, she helped me a lot.

She's a psychologist, also like anime and games as I do, but the thing that made me uncomfortable was everytime I said i felt lonely and abandoned, and that I wasn't good at making friends, she said ""hey i can be your friend too, you are so cool"".  
And i kept saying many times that i don't want to mix things up. Besides most of the therapy sessions were just venting and her listening and validating, and I told her several times that asking me to consider her a friend made me feel i was paying her to be a friend for me. It also reminded me when i was a kid and used to tell my mother (narcissistic) that i wanted friends and she replied saying ""but you have me, mom is your friend"", so it creeps me out hearing this from the psychologist that is treating me.  
We hang out a couple of times, because yes, i tried to see if befriending her was a good idea, but i didn't feel comfortable so i avoided any further invitation.  
I told her i never get  presents for my birthday and for one of them she sent me a huge box with chocolates and a plush (i am  terrified of plushes and felt bad she didn't consider that) but I was awkwardly thankful anyways.

I stopped attending therapy with her because I have over a year without seeing improvements or differences in treatment and just speaking doesn't always work, I need guidance in working on my recovery. So I found another therapist with a different approach, so far it has been intense and painful but I feel it's working, she opened the gate to other inner demons i wasn't aware of (codependency and cptsd).

Was I rude with my previous therapist without saying anything? We still follow each other in social media (we have contacts in common too) and still interact via memes. Did someone have a similar experience where your therapist wanted to befriend you?

  
TL;DR: I stopped seeing my previous therapist because she insisted that we could be friends too. Did I do the right thing?

I got diagnosed with KC (Keratoconus) about 3 months ago. No Eye issues before, No glasses, No Contacts, just a case of bad luck. I Worked at a tree company for a year, then I sweated for a year of brutal work, 16 hour shifts, storm calls, taking trees off power lines for merely 20/hr etc etc… and was looking forward to getting a Class B CDL. Then the company screwed me over so I left. I had enough after dealing with a lot of BS and racial incidents and knew I was just a number once again, bunch of false promises. 

Anyways, Worked there for a CDL B and never got it after all but it was okay I had saved up money for it. So A year of planning anyways I was hustling lol.I had my plan, Went to a DOT physical and I failed the eye exam due to having blurry vision on my right eye. Next thing you after 4 doctors all saying I have KC, I have found one that finally make contacts and takes insurance, Its been about of month, insurance is covering the contacts but I just been waiting. And waiting. It's special hard lens contacts, not like a over the counter contacts you can buy at a pharmacy store.



I’m getting to a depressive point. Struggling to sleep now. This is the longest I haven’t worked in 3 years. I went from working at Fedex at 18 then quit there after a year 1/2+ and jumped to this other company a day after then proceeded to worked there for a year. So Basically, this was my first vacation in 3 years after working non stop 50+ hours weeks. But now it’s not in my hands…man, I don’t like not having control on something I can’t do anything about…I haven’t told my significant other yet, nor my family but it finally caught up after 3 months of not working. I’m a workaholic….clearly……But this, after 3 months this is now really taking a toll. Just feeling low and unmotivated.

 Been doordashing recently to make income just for gas tbh and little smalls dates for my girl because honestly, she’s been great, understanding and actually helpful and not put me down. (Dealt with toxicity beforehand with others so learning on healthy aspects and traits so bless her man.)Once I’ll get my contacts, I’ll be doing still the CDL school 8am to 4pm then working PT or possibly FT, really not liking the idea at working at Fedex again but I’m leaning too it at this point… hard to find a 6pm-10pm shift jobs in my area.…Not sure it’ll be brutal but I should be able to do it and still study. I mean, it’ll be temporary for 2 months anyways.

I just want to make everyone proud. I just want to make myself proud, and you know….it takes a toll trying to pretend everything going good, but god I’m scared still, but I don’t want others to worry, I’m independent most times but I think I can’t be independent on this anymore, I just gotta be expressive, thanks for reading I appreciate it.

I think I’m bipolar but no one will listen to me.,2,1.0,2024-06-10 06:28:21,"Let me start out first by saying, I(18F) am in no way trying to self diagnose. This is something that I have been struggling with for a few years now, but everytime I try to talk to someone about it, it always gets dismissed. My first therapist I tried telling about this issue, said it was normal and just a part of puberty, and everyone feels this way and goes through this. Of course, she sent me to the hospital to get a psych evaluation when I mentioned offing myself, but didn’t think once that maybe this correlates to what I was trying to tell her. And then just recently, when I tried telling my current therapist, she said that it was because my PERIOD can cause mood swings. MOOD SWINGS. 

I went home crying that day because I finally worked up the courage to tell her about the shit I’ve been going through most of my life, and she blamed it on my period. It hurt so bad to hear that from her, and to once again be ignored by someone I thought i could tell anything too. 

To be clear on what’s going on, and why I think i might be bipolar, is because I go through episodes where sometimes I feel intense emotions, and other times I feel absolutely nothing, which leads to very dangerous situations. In the past, (and present) during these episodes I often relapse on self harm, and drinking. I go into a headspace where I just don’t think or feel anything and therefore loose any reason to not drink/self harm. And in the episodes where I feel too much, it’s a huge crash of emotions, relapsing on the same things, lashing out on the ones I love most, and loosing opportunities because I’m too upset or angry to do anything, but lash out. 

These episodes come and go, i get a few weeks (or less) of peace, and then their back, and normally last weeks, to a month. And no, it does not match up with my period cycle. I know exactly how period mood swings are, this isn’t that. And just one more thing, I don’t ever remember much after the episodes end. Like I really couldn’t tell you what happened during that time, because I wasn’t mentally present for it. 

So in conclusion, can someone please help me figure this out. Let me know what you think this is, and if it does sound like bipolar disorder, how do I get my therapist to listen?? I really need people to stop brushing this issue off, it affects my life deeply, and I need help.

My dad is divorcing her and I'm happy he is. She has done so many terrible things to my dad's side of the family. Here are some examples. She is neglectful to my little siblings (her and my dad's kids). She forcefully shaved my legs when I was 8 and I was crying and begging her to stop. I now hate shaving my legs because of her. Also, she's one of the reasons my mental health is garbage.

one of my coping mechanisms for bad things is maladaptive daydreaming. It's basically where you daydream more than the normal person (that's how I explain it anyway. probably not the best explanation but whatever. google it if it doesn't make sense). It's gotten worse after every bad event (for example, family members going to the hospital for an emergency, stepmom being a bitch, life being stressful).

I've done it so much during bad events that I don't know any other coping mechanisms. I don't know my emotions on this. I don't know if I'm sad, mad, or both. I don't know how to handle my emotions or bad events in healthy ways. I can't go to therapy because my mom wouldn't believe me if I told her that I daydream to deal with bad events (and other mental health stuff). She would probably tell me that I'm fine and then compare me to the kids at the school she works at to ""prove me wrong and to prove I'm fine"".

Depression? ,1,1.0,2024-06-10 09:40:36,"Tldr- wisdom teeth removed and got depression

Hi guys, just recently got back from a Holiday and had my wisdom teeth removed. I had no pain or anything and recovered smoothly, however I am now insanely sad, at any given moment of time I can go from so happy to crying. Bit of a back story I've had a horrible couple of years with the passing of my father and alot of other events, but I've pushed through and been surprisingly optimistic, but after the surgery things went downhill.

Now what is curious about this is that I will be fine, then I'll get an insane anxious energy, where I basically will need to run, (I hate running) I'll go for a 5km + run and I'll start crying whilst running. I describe the pre symptoms as almost like a bee swarm in my stomach.
Then I just run it out and am still sad afterwards, but it then passes and it almost didn't happen.

I'm planning on going to see someone I just want to know if this is something people experience or if anyone could try explain this so I feel like I'm more equipped?

My brother had psychotic relapse ,1,1.0,2024-06-10 09:29:17,"My 28-year-old brother got engaged to a girl, but unfortunately, she ran away with someone else. This caused him immense pain and he had a psychotic episode. Although he was harmless, he lost consciousness and was speaking to voices. We took him to a psychiatrist and, with medication, he miraculously recovered. He was committed to doing well, worked out daily, and the doctor gradually reduced his medication.
He was also involved in good hobbies, doing very well at work. 

At 30, He wanted to get married, so we found another family, and everything went smoothly. However, after his second engagement, he unexpectedly had another episode(around 14 months after first). he had lack of sleep for couple of days and started showing the signs. So we took him to hospital.The doctor mentioned that seasonal changes could also trigger this. His medication dosage has been increased again: Sulpitac 200mg, Encorate Chrono 500mg, and Lopez 2mg.

I am scared. We initially informed the girl's family about his stress and medication, but this recurrence is worrisome. I feel completely clueless.

He is still recovering. Is there some way to prevent this from happening? Should I seek additional medical help.

Should i worry about memory loss?,1,1.0,2024-06-10 09:25:06,"Hello! Before going to the main point, i’m going to explain a bit about myself.
So, i’m a 20 (turning 21) man, diagnosed with bipolar disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and i guess i am diagnosed with depression and anxiety too. I take many meds: lamictal/lamotrigine 50mg/day, deprax/trazodone 100mg/day, and fluoxetine/prozac 40 mg/day. I also take some asthma and allergies medicines daily but i don’t think they matter now.
So, my problem is that i’ve been having subtle and manageable memory loss for a long thime, the only consequence about it being that my friends always tell me i repeat everything i say multiple times and i’ve lost some doctor appointments and, okay, i definitely can live with that (kinda)
But this weeks, i’ve started to feel very uncomfortable. I can’t distinguish between days anymore. I don’t know the day i’m living right now. My dad’s birthday party was like four days ago, but i feel it was today. I went to a doctors appointment about three weeks ago, and i feel like it was today, too. Like if i have just walked out of the hospital right now, and i can reality check the thing with my dad’s birthdays since i know the exact date, that doesn’t match with today. I can’t remember conversations with my friends. some days ago, or yesterday, or who knows , we were going to have a hangout together at 11:30 am, and i called him at 11:50 to ask if we were going to see each other that day. Things like that ocurr regularly.
So, should i be scared? in december they did a mri scan with my brain and it was all right.

“The man who can “ a poem by Albert Guest that has helped me deal with my phobias I thought I’d never face ,1,1.0,2024-06-10 09:09:40,"Can't

Can't is the worst word that's written or spoken; 
Doing more harm here than slander and lies; 
On it is many a strong spirit broken, 
And with it many a good purpose dies.
It springs from the lips of the thoughtless each morning 
And robs us of courage we need through the day: 
It rings in our ears like a timely-sent warning 
And laughs when we falter and fall by the way. 

Can't is the father of feeble endeavor, 
The parent of terror and half-hearted work; 
It weakens the efforts of artisans clever, 
And makes of the toiler an indolent shirk. 
It poisons the soul of the man with a vision, 
It stifles in infancy many a plan; 
It greets honest toiling with open derision 
And mocks at the hopes and the dreams of a man. 

Can't is a word none should speak without blushing; 
To utter it should be a symbol of shame; 
Ambition and courage it daily is crushing; 
It blights a man's purpose and shortens his aim. 
Despise it with all of your hatred of error; 
Refuse it the lodgment it seeks in your brain; 
Arm against it as a creature of terror, 
And all that you dream of you some day shall gain. 


Can't is the word that is foe to ambition, 
An enemy ambushed to shatter your will; 
Its prey is forever the man with a mission 
And bows but to courage and patience and skill. 
Hate it, with hatred that's deep and undying, 
For once it is welcomed 'twill break any man; 
Whatever the goal you are seeking, keep trying 
And answer this demon by saying: ""I can.""

Idk if you have heard of an examination called JEE this exam is conducted 2 times a year and if you pass the exam you get into a college where you can study engineering , almost 1.4 million students appear for it this year itself and the number will rise as the years will pass by and from those 1.4 million students only 100k students can appear for the next phase of JEE , those 2 classmates got their rank in 10,000s whereas I got my rank in 100k .  
Idk where it all started going downhill I was on the same level of knowledge with those two still it all went downhill.  
Fast forward to my current mates all they ever did was enjoy they never did much study yet they always scored better than me   
Today cam the result of another high-fi exam JEE ADVANCED that shit is more hard like way too hard and my old classmates qualified for it and one of them even got his rank in 3 digits

It does not mean that I'm not able to make any friends I can make friends but idk why after sometime they all start to hate me for some reason it's like I'm that friend who always gets left out (I was talking about academics and i came to friendship and all)  
I might not be able to live up to my parents expectations cuz I'm the only last hope for them I belong to lower middle class so for a guy like me I need to study hard just to get only 30k a month (360$) for a month I need to study and I did study hard for 2 years like hell and still i scored like shit (I sored C1)  
I gave up many hobbies like video game , cycling, squash, football and whatnot just to score dog water marks I'm going to give an improvement exam and if i don't get good marks on it  will kms I left everything and still got no good marks or grade , I disappointed each and everyone around me.

People not believing diagnosis but complaining about symptoms?,25,0.94,2024-06-09 14:03:45,"Am I the only one who finds it incredibly irritating when you're talking with a loved one, a family member, a friend, about your DOUBTS about having a certain disorder and they immediatly say you don't have it and basically treat you like you're over exaggerating and saying you don't have those symptoms but then blaming you for displaying the same exact symptoms later?   
  
It happened with all my diagnosis. ""I think I have ADHD"" ""No you don't you just want to feel special"" and then ""why can you never concentrate""   
""I think I have autism"" ""No you don't I know autistic people and they're not like that"" and then ""stop having a meltdown about this insignificant thing""  
etc etc.   
""I think I have OCD"" ""No you don't you're not a clean freak"" and then ""You're so annoying because you've been obsessed with this thought""  
Or about the symptoms, like ""this thing causes sense of grandiosity"" and they say you don't have it and then in the same exact breath: ""why do you always think you're right?? you have a big ego!""

Usually when you get an official diagnosis then they say they always knew it, or they just don't care and completely ignore your struggles or tell you ""it's not an excuse though"" or ""I would have never guessed"" or they even start saying they might have it too, lol, and start derailing every conversation about it about themselves even when they didn't believe you at first!! Or they say ""I just wanted you to stop worrying about having this big bad evil disorder"" but I wasn't even worried, I was just genuinely curious and wanted help!! The diagnosis will not make me experience the symptoms I feel like I'm already experiencing. It will just give me accomodations and the toolbox to manage them.  
  
I find it so annoying, but it keeps happening, with all my problems. Sometimes even with physical ones (for example no one believed I had tendinitis). How do I let this stop?   
  
When I say ""I think I might have this"" or ""I relate to these symptoms"" I'm not even saying I am sure I have it, but people always think I am and just want to be special or that I think I have all the problems in the world. And what if I did? What if I have a lot of diagnosis and problems? Why is it so hard for people to accept?

I just want to vent because this happened today. I was talking to someone for about a month or so. This has only been online and through another app. Anyways, everything was going well but as time goes by, it's clear that we both want different things in a relationship and we view some things differently. I explained to him what I was feeling in regard to some of our differences. I told him that I do not think it's a good idea for us to continue our relationship but I will happily be his friend and still keep in touch. That's when he started to threaten me that he was going to ""play with his gun"" because there's nothing else to live for without me. It continued on for about a week or so and I kept telling him that I DO NOT want him to hurt himself. I kept reassuring him that his life is important and that I'm still going to be around but just not as a girlfriend. Unfortunately, I do not have any of his friends or family contact information. Hell, I don't even know his last name. That's how early we were in the talking phase. I couldn't even warn anyone. 

We didn't talk for about 2 days and today he saw me online with a few friends. He started to harass me, cuss me out, and call me names. He told me that I wanted to stop talking to him because I probably wanted to ""suck dicks"" and ""shake my ass"". I told him that his behavior is really unacceptable at this point and I wished him the best. He started to threaten me again with suicide. However, this time, I ended up blocking him on everything. 

I'm just venting. I don't know if I did the right thing.

The disturbing childhood and my behaviors as a child.,1,0.99,2024-06-10 04:29:19,"Hello. This is going to be deleted later as I don't want this traceable with me, but I would like some advice and thoughts. As an 18 currently I have many mental issues like severe anxiety and depression, anxious-attachment and lots of self harm and suicidal thoughts. I struggle with empathy outside of close friends and I have not as much for family as I should. I feel very particular about things and am also very paranoid. But that's not what I want to talk about. When I was 3-6 I used to hurt my pets. Not very bad, I would drop rocks on my dog's heads and I would feel bad eventually and I would take puppies and drop them from a height(doesn't matter how high but not very). This all culminates and stops when I tortured my lizard and eventually boiled him alive. This next part makes me want to kill myself so fucking much so please go easy. I used to, fully clothed both of us, touch my sister in inappropriate areas and just showed her my. She was 3 and probably doesn't remember this at all I pray. I have not done anything like that since I swear. There was no naked touching and no rape but It's still so gross. I later sucked the penis of a friend after what I feel like was pressure from me however he agreed and I stopped when he said to( I was probably 12). I also grew up watching gross porn. I also found out I was gay. This feels like a serial killer's backstory and I was just thinking about my childhood and how fucked up I was and am. At this point I just want to kill myself. Life is miserable and I'm a horrible person and deserve to rid myself of this earth. Is there any thoughts anyone can add. Preferably offer some peace of mind, if not I completely understand.

Partner considering ending her life,1,1.0,2024-06-10 04:23:07,"I (32M, foreigner) am living in Japan with my partner (28F, japanese).

We have been living together for around 3 years but due to many circumstances i don't feel we should continue our relationship anymore. (she is also my fiancee since 2 years ago)

However, upon starting discussing this possibility, due to the fact that she was extremely invested in me and she also lost ties to her family due to our relationship, he started mentioning the serious possibility of considering suicide, as now I am also living her and she is really losing her motivation to live.

Now, I do know sometimes people threat to do this when breaking up, but I have seen people with depression in the past, and I want to believe I can sense when someone is being serious about their suicidal thoughts, which seems to be the case this time.

I want to help her avoid this, but considering its me the one who is generating this situation, is hard.

I have tried convicing her to keep her friends close and communicating with her, or even finding mental support here. However, she mentions me that the moment she decides to take the step for looking at ""official"" mental support is the same moment she would be making her mind to do the deed... She even started thinking of how she will do it and the possible timelines to do so.

I have been trying to find mental support here in Japan but is quite lacking. Most of them are chats but unless you are the actual person in distress they don't reply to you.

Needing advice and help without religion,1,1.0,2024-06-10 04:07:44,"Hey everyone,



I created this throwaway account because I really need some help. I've struggled with smoking pot since I was 15 and now, at 33, I'm facing even bigger challenges. The past three years have been particularly tough. I lost my best friend (he died in his sleep from heart complications) and our dog of 8 years in the same month. This sent my small friend group into a tailspin, and we all turned to some unhealthy coping mechanisms.



I’ve been with my wife for 11 years, and she’s dealing with the same issues. We don’t have children or major responsibilities outside of our jobs, but our jobs are part of why we need help. We both hold community positions where we’re well recognized and liked, which is why we need to stay anonymous. No one knows how deep we’ve fallen into this hole, and we feel like we’re letting each other down. We're struggling to find a way out without resorting to religious groups or long counseling trips (we live in the country).



It all started with some coke after drinking. Through friends with shady connections, we gained regular, cheap access to coke. Using coke regularly led to heavy drinking and smoking. On our recovery days, we’d smoke pot and binge eat. As a result, we’ve gained weight, developed bags under our eyes, and become severely out of shape. Despite this, no one has noticed, and we continue to excel at our jobs. We also have the flexibility to work from home, which lets us indulge in these habits and take days off repeatedly.



We’ve both been hurt by religion and don’t want to join recovery groups focused on God, which are the only ones available in our rural area. We don’t want to lose our friends either, as they’re our only friends and we’ve known them since childhood. Our home life feels monotonous, filled with chores, games, eating, and basic tasks. The joy seems gone from our lives. Despite this, my wife and I love each other deeply and want to do better for each other. We’re struggling to find consistency while at home.



When I manage to stay off coke, I do well with not drinking or smoking. But staying away from coke is hard since it motivates me to tackle home tasks. Without it, I spiral into frustration and a messy environment, making it hard to clean up while trying to get sober. This mess triggers my coke habit, which in turn triggers alcohol and smoking.



How can I break this cycle? Any advice is much appreciated.",mentalhealth,Strugglebussininout,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dccqnl/needing_advice_and_help_without_religion/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06

While in Phoenix I was invited out by this kid I met in the gym to bible study, but I didn't have the opportunity to go since we moved to San Diego about 4-5 months ago. Plus I wasn't too sure about it since I've never been religious. My hobbies include going to the gym frequently, reading manga, watching anime, pets, listening to music, drawing, writing, etc. all kind of introverted stuff. I'm not currently in school (taking a break and just kinda seeing where my life goes rn) and actively job hunting. I had a job in Seattle but I wasn't able to make friends my age there. I struggle with self confidence and I'm currently at a very low point, my family isn't sure what they can do for me. Trust that reddit is kinda my last resort, sorry I'm not super familiar with using this platform but just wondering how I can meet people in a brand new city?

Grace is a horrible horrible person. She has these dark impulses about “hurting people” (I will get into detail later, so be warned. I’ll let you know beforehand though).

My system is made of about 13 alters, including me and Grace. Absolutely all of us are scared of her. Our protector, Ash/Atlas, is dormant, and I feel like it’s up to me to keep Grace in check.

Her thoughts and wants aren’t just “dark” or “immoral”, they’re straight up criminal, sick, completely deranged.

**(Now’s the part about her impulses. I’ll let you know when it’s over).**

>!Today, she and our girlfriend had an argument about how she “finds necrophilia attractive”. They’ve fought before about her admitting to like to fantasize about rape, murder, kidnapping, torture, cannibalism and many other things… And if that wasn’t bad enough, she also said she’d “do these things to innocent, random people on the street”.!<

>!She’s gotten to the point of, one day, some months ago, fully dressing up in a dress, mask, wig, gloves and boots, with the intent of going out and fucking murdering someone. Luckily, someone knocked on our door while she was getting ready, which forced her to undo her suit-up and answer.!<

>!She bought a knife a while ago, claiming it was for self-defense. I know it wasn’t. I know her, I know she wants to kill someone. I know she wants to fuck the corpse and eat the meat. I know because she told me about it.!<

**(Graphic part over)**

We have specific triggers that bring her to the front, like TV shows such as NBC’s Hannibal, CW’s Batwoman, movies like Spider-Man (the ones with the Green Goblin or Venom), or situations like going out with our knife with the intent of actual self-defense. I think she sees herself in those medias, so I personally avoid them at all costs.

This fucking girl has cost us months of happiness, a happy engagement, and years of self-doubt before we knew we were a system. I am tired, I am scared, I need help… We need help.

I don’t know what to do, she is scary and knows that what she is doing is considered “bad”, she just doesn’t care or doesn’t understand why exactly that is bad. Please help us.

Mental health has been getting worse for me.,2,1.0,2024-06-09 22:59:35,"15M. A series of events has happened this year. A fight with my little sister's drug addict father, a very toxic relationship. Not too long ago I got beat up badly in the school's restroom with a whole audience watching and putting me down. I'm starting to indulge in horrible self-talk. I can feel ok throughout the day, but as soon as I go to bed, all the bad thoughts start creeping up. I start thinking of every bad thing that has ever happened to me. I can't sleep for hours because of that. Just laying in bed and having a headache from all the thinking. Today I broke down for seemingly no reason. I start thinking about what I want to be in life and how I don't think I can ever catch up. I don't think I can become the cool, strong charismatic man I want to be. I see my peers acting a certain way, reacting a certain way and I don't understand why I'm so different. Why something so natural to them is so alien or fucked up to me. I hate myself because I get insecure and weak sometimes. I see my peers who don't take any shit and never get bullied, and I feel very unmanly and weak compared to them. I see my peers to whom life just seems so natural and to them things are the way the have to be, but to me, I'm just really confused.

When I'm reading a non-fictional book I'm feeling mental and physical pain. I'm reading about productivity and perfection and it physically hurts me to think that I'm lagging behind so badly. Even writing this, I'm experiencing a bad headache and throat pain because of my emotions.

I don't accept myself the way I am, I hate myself. I hate the fact that I'm so unmanly. The fact that I'm so different. The fact that everyone goes through shit with no care in the world, while I take pretty much anything very close to heart.

The shit I'm into is not appreciated by anyone. My craft is so specific that everyone thinks I'm stupid because they don't understand me. I hate the fact that I'm so different.

None of this would matter. For as long as I could remember, I never indulged in destructive behaviors. But I've been bottling shit up lately and have been hating on myself too much. I used to have s-cide thoughts 3-4 years ago, but honestly, I don't remember much from that time. I don't have any as of now, not at all. I used to be way more confident in myself and I used to be way more ""sober"" whenever thinking. Now I'm spending way more time alone and am falling into the trap of self-destruction.

What to expect in a mental hospital long term?,1,1.0,2024-06-10 02:40:41,"I've had some issues in my past and to be fair, I have managed to stay afloat for the most part. Financially speaking, I don't have a bad life. Nothing too fancy but I own a small business, own my house, a couple of vehicles ,and live without financial distress. 

When I was around 13 I attempted against myself and I always thought I would then do it once I'm older. I never considered aging and living to the end of my natural life. Lately, I as I am 33, there's been this urge. I have come to understand today I'm physically healthy, things are okay, my family is okay, everything and everyone I care are fine. And this is a good time but because of this, I've come to terms, that before it gets bad, it would be ideal to end things while it's good.

I attempted about 2 months ago and was sent to a mental hospital. I stayed there for 3 days. I explained I came to this moment due to being drunk and stressed about life. I did not share full honesty as my intention was to get out as quickly as possible because my business needed me.

Now, I attempted again despite my best efforts and I've come to the conclusion, with the advice of my therapist, that I should seek help in a mental institution as I'm in high risk. I'm annoyed that I can't change myself by just trying.

Now, if I fully share all that's wrong, as in opposite of explaining things, as temporary and circumstantial, I would expect to be there for a long period. Will I get used to it? Will I actually get help? Will I be back out being better? I'm worried. I think it is what's best for me but I don't know what to expect and I fear coming out to world in which it would be more complicated as there will be huge loss (savings, investment account, mortgage, etc)

Trying to figure myself out,1,1.0,2024-06-10 02:37:24,"

Hey everybody, recently I've been a bit confused trying to navigate myself and who exactly I am and I'm just hoping to make some sense out of what I've come to realize about myself. 

A few months ago I came to the realization that my whole life up to this point has more or less been a facade. Growing up I was always kind and courteous because that's what I was told to do and I was under the impression because of this I would develop relationships with people but on that same token I always felt disconnected and as a result was in and out of institutions because I felt I shouldn't be around per say.

I'm now 21 years old and have realized although I was a social kid and had a decent amount of ""friends"" I never actually felt comfortable connected to anyone. Even my own family members who are by every metric supportive, open, and available feel like familiar strangers or a coworker you might be friendly with at work but nothing else. The people who know me, I would say only know a face I put on that that compliments the box I put them in. I also don't get joy out of life not for any of the reasons most people have that result in self sabotage like bitterness, comparison, anger, entitlement, etc. No matter how much I try, I don't get joy out of life and I would say when I look at what most people enjoy in life it doesn't make any sense because there's no practical reasons to be doing such outside of emotional stimulation which isn't necessary in my opinion. 

I need to be around people otherwise I'll dehumanize others. At that point they are 1's and 0's and become variables in an equation if you will. In fact I find most people irritating because they let emotion have such a dictation over how they make decisions and only if people are competent can I develop some kind of relationship with them but most people are boring to me because they do and say the same things. Nothing they say or do will make me take a second to consider my approach to life which is why I find being around people a bit irritating. 

I'm honestly just trying to make sense of myself to some extent so I can make a decision that would enable me to be as effective as possible. Thanks. ",mentalhealth,iamdom_720,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dcb4ci/trying_to_figure_myself_out/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13411641178203e-06
"I'm stuck in a lose-lose situation with my partner, what do I do?",1,1.0,2024-06-10 02:37:13,"Was gonna post this in r/relationship_advice, but my issue includes mental health issues so I can't post there.

TLDR: I'm tempted to break up with my partner because I'm not in love with him, he's made false promises and I don't find him attractive anymore, but I would lose out on my opportunity to escape my horrible living conditions.

Me (20M) and my partner (19M) have been dating for over 2 years, and had a rocky relationship to begin with, but it's finally smoothened out over the past 7-8 months. We still have some issues, for example, he's lying about job applications, but it's significantly better. I, however, just don't feel the love anymore. He doesn't warm my heart up like how he used to. I know relationships are cyclical, but I've felt this way for weeks now. I've tried 'reigniting the spark' but nothing is working. 

I think I realised this when I was calling a (straight male) friend and he made a flirtatious joke. It was obviously a joke, we both laughed, but I blushed. And I had that warm feeling in my heart again. I haven't felt that feeling for months. I don't have a crush on this friend, I'm strictly loyal, but my god it felt so good to have someone say something flirtatious about me without it feeling forced. This, as well as the fact I just don't find my partner physically attractive anymore (having to close my eyes whenever we do the deed). He hasn't changed physically either, he still dresses and presents himself the same way as well. 

I'm supposed to be moving in with him and his family in a couple of months time. This is something I've been waiting on for YEARS. My current home life is fucking miserable. My mum is absent, leaving me to take care of my younger sister and the house whilst I'm also a full time student, working as much as I can, and struggling with mental health issues. I can't afford to pay for all the bills and food, so there's a constant threat and worry of anything being cut off (electricity, water, gas, internet etc) since my mum isn't paying for any of it. I've had some days where I don't eat just so my sister can eat. I've looked at other ways I can move out, and none of them are currently feasible. This situation is making my depression and anxiety even worse.

The issue is, I don't want to move in with my partner if I'm not happy with our relationship, because if the relationship doesn't improve then I'm fucked, and moving back home would cost a lot of money I don't have. 

I don't know what to do. If I break up with him and stay living at home, I could get a full time job (since my studies will finish soon) so the financial situation at home improves, but I also just fucking hate where I live. I live in a small town and because of my mum being a drunkard, random people know about her and I get people at work asking if I'm her son. I just want to leave this fucking town as soon as I can because I can't stand it anymore. I also want to save up money and travel a bit, and just generally have some more freedom and just be young and be myself.

my dad isolates himself from the rest of my family and suffers in silence with his depression/anxiety... how can i help him?,1,0.99,2024-06-10 02:36:39,"to start off, i'm 28f and live with my two parents, and my younger brother. 

mental health issues run in my family: i have GAD, my mom has depression. my dad never seemed to struggle with anything except in the last couple of years. we've never had the best relationship; he's always isolated himself in the basement being on his computer (on reddit, watching youtube videos, listening to music, etc). him and my mom don't have the best relationship either, they used to argue all the time when i was growing up but i guess as they got older they couldn't be bothered anymore, they're too tired of it. but only in the last couple of years did i notice the isolation getting worse: he used to at least at dinner with us but now he doesn't, and he barely eats anything. he doesn't come to family gatherings (birthdays or other events), he doesn't even see his own sister anymore (my aunt had a falling out with our family, that may have contributed to his depression/anxiety). 

he went to the doctors just a few months ago to do something about it, after some pushing from me and my mom. he started on SSRIs (lexapro) but then he switched medications because he said it was making him worse. he started paxil now with wellbutrin. i don't notice any significant differences in him and he looks/acts the same. he's still isolating himself and he barely talks to anyone, when he talks to me or my mom he looks down or around, not at us directly, and is kind of like shakey and jittery. 

i think that there's a bunch of issues that have caused his mental health to deteriorate in the last couple of years: his relationship breakdown with his sister, relationship breakdown with my mom (but they still live in the same house), and the fact that we had  to move recently due to our previous landlord selling our house that we rented at the last 25 years. occasionally i check in to ask how he's doing and if the medication is working but he looks and acts the same. he doesn't see a therapist and i doubt he would be comfortable doing that but i'm not 100%. i'm used to talking with my mom about her problems because she's always been an open book and tells me everything (maybe to my detriment)... but with my dad it's hard to know how he feels bc he doesn't open up about his feelings, maybe bc he doesn't want to burden anybody.

I don't think I'm getting better,7,1.0,2024-06-13 18:10:48,"Hi, I'm turning 20 in November, yet I feel like there really isn't much to life. The idea of graduating with a degree, pursuing a career that I'm passionate about, building a family all seems so mundane to me.

I truly envy others who seemingly know what they're doing and wasting no time, thinking about useless stuff like what I'm doing to work towards their goals. I sound like a lazy person that's complaining about every minute thing right now, but the truth is I probably am. But I like to think that I've put an effort to not feel this way but yet I feel nothing.

I feel disconnected from everyone. Parents speak about trusting God and his plans. Good friends all have sound advice for me to deal with this feeling, however I've never been able to resonate with any of it. I'm truly lost. Perhaps I'm finding an excuse to working hard by feeling this way. Maybe not. Either way I'm feeling it.

I used to blame my parents for my upbringing. It may as well be their fault for me being like this. Eventually I've come to accept that holding it against them solves nothing, so I blame myself. I really see no possible future where I can love existing as  the person that I am. I have no idea who I am anymore. Everyday I have a hundred thoughts for every single thing I want to do. It's exhausting and I don't think I can do it anymore.

I'm scared of the pain of dying. But sometimes I wish I had the balls to do it. This whole life thing is not working out for me no matter what bullshit mindset I'm forcing myself to have. I'm gonna start praying I don't wake up the next day starting from tonight.

People on the internet need to understand this one thing,2,0.67,2024-06-13 04:31:02,"You can hop on reddit, get on a burner account, and wreak absolute havoc with zero repercussions. 

You can respond to someone’s post about how they want to off themself and decide to tell them they’re a horrible human being for putting other people through that. 

You can judge someone for using Reddit or the internet as a source of help. 

You can make the conscious decision to bully someone who is at rock bottom. 

It’s so incredibly easy being mean to people you don’t know. You’ll never learn their name, you’ll never see them in person. You’ll never feel the guilt or see their face when they read your disgusting message. 

Like I said, there’s zero repercussions. 

I’ll still never be able to understand why people do it. Why trolls are a thing. Why people find gratification in doing these things. 

We learn to ignore the “internet trolls,” or we hear “don’t let them get to you,” as a response. But we continue to allow it to happen. It’s almost expected of you to just brush off rude comments and you’re weak if you let them get to you. Why is that? How come they don’t put algorithms in play to stop trolling from happening? Bullying on the internet has caused a lot of issues. 

It’s one of the most disgusting things on the planet in my opinion. 

Personally, I’ve reached out for help. Several times. Been at rock bottom, several times. Wanted to off myself, several. times. And every time, I’d get rude comments that just made me want to do it even more.

Anyone that feels the same in early 20s?,4,1.0,2024-06-12 20:36:55,"Hi guys, I'd like to share some insights, and hopefully start a positive discussion with anyone that might feel the same, just so we may know that we are not alone in this.

So, I'm in my early 20s and lately I've really been hit by some bitter emotions regarding my life experience and where I'm currently at. Actually I would be classified as an ""on time"" or ""regular"" young adult. Right about to finish my uni studies, learned to live on my own and stuff like that. 
Still, I feel like I missed on many things both in my teenage years and in my early adulthood. When I was younger it was due to the fact that I was lacking mental care and I couldn't do many things. Now that I'm almost fully recovered thanks to a few years with professional help, I find myself in a healthier mental state, and I truly know how to face situations with a balanced attitude. But the thing is, I feel like healing took a big part of my life away, and now I'm not where I would have thought my promising life would have been. 

I started to obsess over the fact that I'm average on many things, while I'm surrounded by some cases who are making exceptional things. I never made a penny while others are having great ideas on business and succeeding in that (recently started to learn some business related skills with 0 results, and I am very discouraged. Without any money I feel like I cannot do many experiences), never gained a circle of friends (During these years I was very focused on my studies and goals, while others seemed to be on a party-mode all the time, so either was difficult to relate or it was difficult for me to find people that were lovely and interesting to be with on a deeper level. Loneliness is another big feeling rn), and overall I experienced a constant sense of trying not to stay behind other folks (and that sucked all my energy) rather than feeling like having a good starting point to learn, grow, and discover things and relationships that will make me happy and richer inside. 

I don't know how to overcome this sense of feeling lost and not having done anything special with my life. To me regular stuff is like an usual procedure that needs to be done.

Hopefully I explained myself, since this is not my mother tongue. Willing to listen from your perspective!

But I'm trying. 

I have a psychiatrist and a therapist I like. I've started SSRIs

I'm reaching out to friends and family for help. 

If I can't finish my breakfast, then I'll try to at least take 3 more bites.

I am driving myself crazy with these thoughts of becoming rich.,5,0.86,2024-06-12 17:13:58,"Hi, I’m 24F, I have a marketing job and make £35,000 annually. My job fulfils all my needs and I am not that big of a spender on material things. But I constantly keep thinking of wanting more money.

My thoughts are sometimes very rampant about wanting £100k as my salary which of course isn’t realistic. It used to be more controlled but recently its going off the charts and I cannot enjoy a single moment of my life in peace.

I also compare my salary to those earning more than me alot. For eg: in tech. background.

Just to give background: I come from a not so well to do family and have grown up in scarcity of money. I am an immigrant and trying to create a life from scratch.

I appreciate my job but I just want to be rich and the definition of ‘rich’ is unrealistic for me (making £100-£150k in salary).

Every school night I would study from 6 pm to 3 am to get my grades up for the expectations of my school but never made it in the list of honors. My elders would tell me to grow up and practice for the adult world but they wouldn't let me out by myself nor help me. My cousins would make fun of my attitude because I always acted childish.

I hate change. a couple days before Christmas my parents got a new set of utensils and threw out our old set and I sobbed because now all are utensils feel different and they aren’t correct, even 6 months later I’m still not completely used to them. this is also not the first time ive cried about dish ware getting changed. I’m not sure how many years ago it was but they got a new dish set and packed up the old one and again I cried. I’m used to the new set but I still don’t love it.

when I get overwhelmed I’ll end up pacing and if I’m really overwhelmed I’ll end up flapping my hands. honestly, if I’m alone I'm usually always moving in some way tho I find it hard to sit completely still.

I make eye contact so it can seem like I’m paying attention but I’m not sure if the average person consciously thinks that.

I'll have a hard time understanding and processing things and it makes me feel stupid. like if I don’t know if someone is going to talk to me and then they do I’ll probably have to ask them to repeat themselves a couple of times.

I have a hard time talking. in my head I can form cohesive sentences and use big words but in the real word when I try to speak I end up forgetting the most basic words or can’t pronounce the big ones and it’s so frustrating.

Depression is such an isolating illness. No one can reach into your head and take the pain away from you. You have to put in the work and save yourself.

But other times I’m creating scenarios that have nothing to do with my life, like a parallel universe type of thing. And I do this on the daily, pretty much any time I get quiet down time this is happening.

I hated growing up in my rich family,3,0.67,2024-06-12 00:02:36,"I grew up in a very wealthy family, and I hated it. Before I say anything, I want to clarify: I acknowledge the privilege and benefits that come with money. I'm grateful for the comfort my parents provided, and I'm not taking anything for granted, including having a roof over my head, good healthcare, and education. I also understand that one can experience poverty and have abusive parents simultaneously, and money didn’t cause my parents to be the way they are. I just want to make this clear so I don’t seem like a spoiled brat.

The reason I want to share this is that I’ve never felt I could talk about my financial background without being judged. Maybe this will help.

My parents built their fortune from the ground up, coming from poor backgrounds to owning a successful healthcare clinic chain. Since I was a baby, they wanted me to take over the family business and study law, economics, or medicine. They wanted the best for me, but I never had any interest in taking over the business. I have ADHD, I'm terrible with numbers and organizing, and I hate nepotism. I believe many others could do a better job than me.

I always felt that the business and money were more important than me. My parents were only concerned about my academic performance and didn't care about how I felt. They would get mad if I spent time with friends or pursued my passion for dancing, seeing these activities as a waste of time. They worked long hours and had a terrible relationship with each other. I made it clear from age 12 that I had no interest in the business, pursued a degree in marketing, worked as a barista, and now work in a marketing agency while trying to dance professionally.

Since childhood, my parents told me I was a failure and should be embarrassed by my lack of achievements. They constantly reminded me that I would be nothing without them. Money ruined my childhood. I grew up with babysitters, as my parents were always working, and they were verbally abusive and controlling. I had issues with self-harm from the age of 6. 

It confuses me when people find out who my parents are and tell me how lucky I am. Even if I shared my background, I always felt labeled as ""the rich kid.""

I am currently a 27 year old male, I have no friends and I live alone because i am single. When i was about 7 years old there was a 2 year stretch of time in my life where I was raped often. I grew up pretending everything was ok when in reality it wasnt. I was bullied SEVERELY in school to the point of going to the hospital numerous times as well as constantly being told i should kill myself or just not exist. I have tried 4 separate times to kill myself and even succeeded once but was revived.

I'm not sure if its because of those things or if I'm just making excuses but i am constantly struggling with the voice in my head doubting myself over every little decision i make and everything i do. to the point of it interfering with my work ( not that that matters its just a minimum wage retail job cuz i cant get anything better) 

I dropped out of my university twice because I kept thinking that I was useless and wouldn't be able to accomplish anything.

basically, i'm a really anxious guy. i have several phobias (apotemnophobia, dysmorphophobia but what matters here is my nyctophobia) and i am scared of a lot of things. i often hear people speaking when there's no one around, mainly when i'm in the streets at night and alone (so when i'm already anxious), but also when i'm alone without being in an anxious environment.
they often say distinct stuff, but they're never talking to each other (they're not answering etc, and when they're speaking to someone it's me). they whisper, they talk normally and sometimes they even shout — but not much.
it happens a lot when i have these kinds of... paranoid crisis i guess? so mainly in anxious settings. it sometimes is the cause of a crisis as well, but not often.
i'm 17M and don't have any mental health issues as far as i'm aware of, just phobias, anxiety, autism (none of which i think would cause that). i smoked once, but i already had this problem before and i never took any other drugs.

There has never been any meaning in my life. All I have is wealth through my parents.,0,0.5,2024-06-10 01:58:22,"Title may be misleading, so I hope I don‘t take away anyone‘s time.

Hey,
I can‘t cope with my lucky upbringing and wealth anymore.

I was raised in a household that wasn‘t quite super rich, but we could always buy what we wanted and money was never a problem.

Furthermore, I am an only child, so there were no arguments about which kid should get this and that, I was always the focal point of my partents. Also I will later be the only one who gets all the wealth like our house from inheritance.

Finally, I come from a country in the EU where salaries are very high and thus, the purchasing power in other countries is even higher, so travelling to other continents was possible (sometimes even multiple times a year)

Recently, I came to think about how lucky I am and calculated numerically in which class of the world population I would fall. I figured out that I belong to the top 500.000 people on this planet when it comes to having a comfortable childhood. Ever since I did this calculation, I wonder about why I deserve this. I have never done anything of much worth beside from few student jobs during the summer holidays. Everything about my life is paid by my parents income or through taxes. Society has given me so much, yet my contribution is low.

I am now a student at an public university in another country and I see my fellow students working hard so they can afford something more in their lives (like going on vacation for example and doing things which improve society) while I just lie in my bed, studying for my exams, and doing absolutely nothing with the money I have, even though I could do so much more to make me more interesting.

I have no real friends in my life, no partner, am autistic and I‘m wondering how I will end up as an working adult. Will I live the same purposeless life I have always done, or will things out better for me, with less unearned money, and how can I contribute more to society so that my life doesn‘t feel like it would be meaningless. I just feel like a massive burden on everyone who has contact with me (like I would take away their time, (see first line)).

When I retire, I would like to die ASAP because then, nobody will have to pay my retirement money through taxes.

Sometimes I just sit at night in a bench in the nearby parc and then I start crying out loud. I‘m doing this so no one can worry about me, which again would feel for me like I just take the time from a potential person who tries to console me.

Can somebody understand my situation?

"OCD, PTSD, Questions about a serious psychological condition.",1,1.0,2024-06-10 01:52:56,"Hello, friends. I wanted to share my situation here in the hope that I might find people who have been through similar circumstances and have healed. I truly feel desperate and lost, but I have a glimmer of hope that I may find solace here. Essentially, I want to clarify that I suffer from OCD and PTSD. This year, I realized that I cannot control my actions, and whenever I think of something, I feel compelled to do it. I don't mean harm to others, but it harms myself. For example, when I see a trend on X platform about disturbing content like animal torture, I will go and watch it as if I cannot stop myself. I see it, then I enter a severe psychological shock and deep depression. Today, I saw a hashtag of someone torturing a cat, I clicked on it, saw it, then exited the video for a while, but then returned to watch it again. The volume was low, but I raised it and started focusing on the gruesome details. I came out horrified and started crying. I tried to understand why I go to see something that hurts me. I thought maybe I'm trying to reassure myself that things are not that bad and everything is okay. Then why did I come back and raise the volume, which is still lingering in my mind, causing me intense pain? The image does not leave my mind, and it terrifies me. Why do I do this to myself? Many things make me feel like I have no control over myself. I won't go into detail, but this issue is the lion's share of what torments me. I shift from one shock to another and blame myself. I am the one causing this to myself. Now, I can't eat or sleep. When I try to forget, I blame myself. I say, how can I do this while there is a creature suffering? I truly don't know. I hope to find someone to help me or someone who has experienced these symptoms and been diagnosed. I am resisting and have hope for treatment, even though I live in a village with no mental health clinics.

Severely struggling with ocd and hoarding. ,1,1.0,2024-06-10 01:10:05,"Early 2023 I moved back out of my mother’s after a spinal cord injury. I was broke and could only afford a horrendous room in terms of cleanliness and organization. When I lived on my own I felt in control of my environment and standard of living so it was easy to maintain and function normally. 

But then I arrived at this house. The first thing I saw was feces on the wall and toilet of the only bathroom which led me to avoid it at all costs plus rotten food animal feces etc.  which in turn made me resort to urinating in bottles and driving to groceries stores to shit. To remain in my comfort bubble of a room. 

This has been happening for over a year and now I have countless urine containers and I have a new better paying job that requires relocation. I’ve been working on disposing of the containers but there’s so many it’s inconceivable. 

I’m so devastatingly ashamed I just want to curl into a ball and die. Can I just throw them in a dumpster? I know it’s wrong and disgusting but legally speaking am I breaking any laws? I just want this chapter of my life to be done so I can be happy and in control again. 

I know this a pathetic post with a pretty harsh stigma attached to the issue at hand but it’s such a compulsion and I end up hoarding them because of the shame. 

I’d like to think pee bottles aren’t what takes me off this earth but the dread I feel is deafening. I just want it to go away. It has resulted me relapsing into addiction to block it out of my mind.

I’ve never made a post on this website before, only having used it because I view questions and answers on subjects I’m interested in. I’m a 15 year old girl that lives in an urban city in the south west of Colorado. I went to public high school for around a month after previously being in a private school for 8 years grouped with the same kids and teacher every year. I was pulled out of public school because of an issue regarding something that made me feel unsafe, and since then have been on a primarily online school. I spend most days in my room alone, doing my homework. I do not have siblings nor do I have any neighborhood friends. In the particular neighborhood, it is primarily elderly people. I have social media and had a few friends but eventually things got weird or they simply stopped responding. At the moment I have contact with two people primarily, and two people I spend time with. I talk to a friend from grade 3 online and we see each other sometimes, but we’ve grown apart and they do things that make me uncomfortable. The other is a ‘friend’ also from grade 3. We only recently started talking again, around 8 months or so. He isn’t the nicest person yet he isn’t someone who makes me feel uncomfortable so I try to keep close with him, even if I feel like he’s annoyed with me. The two people I hang out with are my parents. I’m really close with them but they are concerned with my lack of communication and friends. I try making friends online and in real life but like I mentioned previously, I’m the one to start the conversation and eventually I stop and they never start one. The only thing I have that distracts me for now is silly YouTube videos.

Mu perfectionism bleeds into videogames and ruin the fun.,1,0.99,2024-06-10 00:43:59,"I've always had a very strong sense of perfectionism in schoolwork and generwork, but at least some good productivity comes out of it.

However, every time I play games, either with stars or countdown, I NEED to get the best grade. With the gold stars, it's pretty easy, simple and not time consuming. I will restart the same level until I get them. The gold stars are not the problem.

I found this YouTube game, Onet Connect, where you have 5 minutes to finish a level. The first time I tried it, it was fun, I got through some levels and didn't think about my usual negative thoughts.
But then I wanted to play the game again and I thought I'd make it through the first level before 1 minute has passed, and for some reason, I've now spent two hours - not on playing the level and then restarting it, no, I've spent two hours on only looking at the level's randomized layout for between 1 to 5 seconds (literally not more than 5 seconds) then have this feeling that it's not good enough and having to restart the level without connecting more than two things.

The worst part is that I know I should just tell myself to relax and try to finish the game and have fun, but I can't. I can't be in my body if I don't restart the level right away, even if I haven't even tried it. It's so uncomfortable and there is this nagging voice that keep saying, that if I keep going, I'll lose terribly and it will show the stats to everyone, which is just not realistic. There is no public scoring table, and even if there were, people couldn't care less.

Why cant I feel anything anymore?,1,1.0,2024-06-09 23:57:47,"


Idk if i have depression or anxiety etc,all my life things go wrong for me,and secondary school has been such a deep hell.
1st year,semi edgy emo phase,clears up quick.
I'm quite ugly and chubby but I accepted that long ago. I was loud and energetic too,very annoying, sociable tho. 
For some reason in my English class i voiced controversial opinions,I don't even believe in,and that was bad,idk why maybe I did it for attention because no one notices me.So that already fucked up people's view of me.i want to reset.I've seen the videos,people hanging out after school,doing fun trends together,having exciting moments. I tried to get attention in bad ways .i don't remember much from it anymore.
2nd year: it was terrible,worst year of my life,I got really awkward,like REALLY. I can't make eye contact anymore,I start sweating and get red in public/school,so I start of with a shitty reputation,so at the start of 2nd year,I focused on school,ALOT,crying every night about grades and trying to forget the previous year,all I thought of was grades and the tests,so I finish exams,and during Christmas that's when it began,that it all stopped,I can't feel anything anymore. And it all got worse from there. So it's now January,and I  wanted meaning in my life. Then strings of embarrassing things start to happen,I get really red when in public due to stress alot,I start sweating  alot then, then my stomach starts rumbling during class,but mostly in my geography one,so the 2 people on my desk look at me weirdly while I try cover/play it off. I can't make eye contact anymore,oh yeah,we had to do speeches in English and when everyone in class was saying their topics,apparently mine sounded like I was supporting fatphobia,which I wasn't,so I changed my title and apologised during my speech,so that just made it worse. There are multiple,multiple  awkward moments I made for myself during school,that are to long for me to list,but just know they just made my life,more of a living hell in each step,more then I can put in words ever to show even  a fraction of the hell its caused me. Also,one of my closer ish friends has been trying to tease/embaras me all the time,but if I cut her off I will be such a  loner in class because she is in every class I have due to chance. I don't find anything fun anymore,when I laugh with friends it's forced,I have no joy in my hobbies anymore. 
But something has saved me from this ,technology,I constantly play videos and video games ,I don't think anymore with it bluring my thoughts,so now my dad gets pissed that it fills most of my day. And everyone says  ""get support if you are struggling"",my mum says it's too expensive rn,and that I should be fine,when I told her I don't feel anything anymore,she looked at me like I was faking.when I told my friend(that i mentioned)that a certain subject gives me certain episodes,she ,like my mum,tried downplaying it by saying ""well yk depression is a emotion you get"" and moved on. So I'm stuck now, I think I found my fav hobbies ,and I can imagine how I want my life to be,but I fucked it all up.

"NSFW: Something is very wrong with me mentally, but I don't know what it is",1,1.0,2024-06-09 23:44:10,"I'm 26 years old. I have a good and well paying job in the STEM field, a girlfriend, and a fairly tidy and nice looking apartment. I wake up, drive to work, conduct meetings, do presentations and complete my tasks, all with great praise from my coworkers and boss, and when I come home, I cook and clean with my girlfriend, work on various personal projects and so on. I finished my master's degree early, been practicing the violin for a year or so now, and recently started learning French. I consider myself to be quite intelligent.

But I feel like something is really fucking wrong with me and I am just pretending to be normal. At work, I regularly spend a long time in the bathroom just masturbating and snorting my own piss. During meetings from home, I am sometimes tied up to my chair and inflating my bladder through a catheter or shitting in a diaper I am wearing. I have bought medical equipment and tried to intubate myself until 4 in the morning on a work day and all kinds of shit. I once wore an NG tube connected to an automatic pump containing alcohol, went downtown, and basically just walked around while alcohol was being pumped directly into my stomach. Ended up getting super drunk and vomiting in the subway, and the tube came out of my mouth. I regularly get 3-5 hours of sleep per night. Whenever my girlfriend is not home, I tend to stop showering or eating much and I simply piss in bottles instead of using the toilet. One time I was up for almost 3 days straight just doom scrolling and filling my colon with water over and over again and I barely had anything to eat or drink, and my body shut down and I genuinely thought I was going to die. I feel like I have no empathy and don't care about anything. I don't feel happiness. I am always angry and just trying to endure whatever is pissing me off, or if I am lucky I just feel indifferent. I regularly scream and punch the walls if I get frustrated and I am alone. Or I punch, bite and stab myself.

Years ago, I used to do drugs and was close to overdosing multiple times. I have some evil, cold and antisocial tendencies and sexual desires that I don't want to describe in details, but it's basically just a fear of getting in trouble that's keeping me away from certain things. I have done some unpleasant things to people without their knowledge. I have never purposefully attempted suicide, and I don't want to die or anything, but I enjoy hurting myself. And I keep having this weird fear when I am alone that I will see something that's not real. As I am writing this, I keep looking behind me, knowing that there's nothing there, but fearing that my mind has finally broken and for some reason decided that there is indeed some scary ghost girl standing behind me or some shit like that. I am afraid that, one day, I look into the mirror and my face looks different or looks all disfigured. Or when I look out the window, I am afraid I see a face staring back at me. It's not that I think any of this is actually real, but I am afraid that, one day, something inside my brain will finally break and I will start having hallucinations.

Advice for someone who feels like they can’t do anything right.  ,1,1.0,2024-06-09 22:15:25,"I feel a little better posting in here and everything I’m saying is 100% true. I feel like nobody believes me, doesn’t know what to say, judges me, or has become distant from me. I’m sure some of it is all in my head, but who knows. 

In November of last year, a friend of mine wanted to go out for thanksgiving because he was alone. I know he drinks heavily, so I made a point to tell him I’ll drive and we’ll only be out until midnight. He convinced me to drink and keep going to other spots (I know I’m an adult and make my own decisions), so I don’t blame him at all for me staying out. My issue is, I always say yes to ppl and long story short I dropped him off and was thinking he may let me stay one the couch, but he didn’t. I thought about sleeping in my car in the parking lot but knew I had to get home to my dog. I ended up falling asleep at the light. I didn’t wreck or anything but an officer woke me up and ultimately took me to jail for DUI. They took my license for 18mo and I have about 12mo to go. 

Fast forward, I was set to get off probation next week since I finished everything. I got a new apartment in town to be more centralized. I had nobody to drive my car and stuff to my new place. The movers moved a lot but didn’t get some things. I could’ve asked someone to drive my car, but I didn’t. — I ended up getting pulled over and the officer saw a lot of my belongings in the car. He took me to jail again for driving with a suspended license. I begged him to let me go. I broke no laws he said other than he ran my plate and saw I had no license. I bonded out but I know I’m going back because of violation of probation. I’m $12k in the hole for what happened in November and expecting another $5k estimated for getting pulled over trying to move my belongings. My fresh start just feels like a nightmare now. 

My lawyer said expect to go back to jail for the VOP and I could be there for 5-10 days. I’ll probably get out and get back on probation, fines, and more community hours. I know I messed up. I just wish I had more family and friends for support. At the end of the day, it’s still my fault. 

I feel so helpless. I’m going broke and so much is on the line now. My job, car, apartment I just got. I don’t even have anyone to watch my dog while I’m away. 

Really just hoping for no judgement and words of encouragement. I never in my life thought I would be in jail so much. I feel like I’m below all my friends and family now. This just feels like a nightmare I wish would be over.

I could never be like a white girl tho. One day I told him I didn’t think I was his type bc all he did was get with white girls behind my back and he told me I was and that he did like me. Next day he goes on snapchat and I had the urge to tell him to look someone up to make sure he didn’t have them added, on snapchat it shows the history of who’ve you searched and you can basically tell what they look like because of the bitmojis. The history was literally all white girls like a row of just 8 white girls.

Idk now when I see a white girl online I just think about how my ex would probably think they’re so pretty. It’s been a year and a half since I’ve even been with him and it still crosses my mind every time I see a white girl. At this point it’s driving me insane. 

(I forgot to add that one of the girls had actually interviewed me a couple months back for a job I really wanted that I had no idea she was at. Of course she didn’t give me the job all because of this man. She pretended to lose my job application and that honestly set me off even more with insecurity which is why I also couldn’t stop thinking about it.)

My mother insists that I do not have ADHD,1,1.0,2024-06-10 01:29:02,"I have been speculating for many years now that I have ADHD. I am not diagnosed but I have struggled with hyperactive symptoms since I was a child, I'm now 17. Both my friends and my own mother have suggested and agreed that ADHD is something that I could very possibly have. 

About a month ago, I asked my mom about getting an ADHD diagnosis so that I could be put on adderall (at the time I thought that was the only medication for ADHD and I didn't know how intense it is). I sent the message through text while she was out of town, so I never got a reply. I wanted to be put on medication because I felt that my possible ADHD was negatively effecting my life, it made it hard to have a proper sleep schedule and focus on work at all.

Today, I was looking for a therapist, which my mom was fine with. When I showed my mom one of the therapists and said ""one of the things she helps with is listed as ADHD"", my mom got very defensive, saying that I dont have ADHD. She said she knows what ADHD looks like and I don't have it, then started yelling about how she would never let me take adderall, referring to my old text that she didn't reply to. I was very confused because she was one of the people who told me she thinks I have it. I told her that there's probably other ""less intense"" medications for ADHD and she said that they're ""all bad and all come from the same drug"".

Me and my gf have been in a relationship for almost a year now, I love her very much.

Since long before the relationship started I’ve had a porn addiction, I have not been able to stop it since we started dating. I haven’t told anyone about it, including my girlfriend. It has not impacted our sexual life yet but it’s affecting me mentale and I feel like a piece of shit for It, like I should. This addiction is a battle and every day I’m losing more grip.

I told myself it was just because I was bored but I knew full Well my intent was to chat with them. One of them added me back and we talked for hours, no mention of my Girlfriend on my part. There wasn’t any direct flirting going on either, but we chatted deep into the night, while my girlfriend was asleep.

Now I am writing this post, desperate. I feel like a wreck. I love this girl so much, how can I do this to her and myself? These things are keeping me up at night and I don’t know how I can live with myself.

I have anxiety, ADHD, and more then likely depression. My grandma is going to be getting me therapy soon. I've struggled with self harm since I was 11. 

I can tell my grandma is getting Alzheimer's or dementia because of things she does and the way she acts, and it's terrifying. I feel alone, I have no one else besides her.

I feel so alone, I have no one. I don't even feel like anyone loves me. And currently I'm battling my depression and these random episodes I get of extreme sadness, stress, and anxiety. I really need support. I wish I had friends or a partner to hang out with and hug and cuddle, but I don't, and I don't know how to get to that point.

6 months. 16 years.,1,1.0,2024-06-09 23:51:56,"   It's been over 6 months now, I still remember it clearly, but it's no longer something that weighs me down. September 12, 2023, at 9:00 pm is when I attempted. It was hard, terrible. I'm not sure what you've felt, but I promise having to see your dad and sister look at you with tears in their eyes, just staring. It hurts. It hurt even more when my dad started blaming himself. 
   My whole life has been a huge wreck, at least that's what I thought. Since birth, i've always feel like I had some sort of curse. When I was 5, I was assaulted by my brother. When I was 8, my parents divorced. They argued so much before that. I can still remember crying in my Build-A-Bear stuffed animal, covering my ears to stop myself from hearing those horrid screams. My dad didn't visit much after divorce, it was just me, my sister, my mom and my grandma. My mom took it hard, I knew it wasn't just going to be hard for me. She cried and cried, locked herself in her room. Meanwhile, in school I always felt teased and below everyone else. When I was 10, my parents didn't really have very healthy coping skills. My dad tried to find new love, and my mom eventually did find new love. I didn't have to take care of her anymore, but then I just had to do the same thing for the other parent. I dealt with a lot during 11-12 years old. I cant even remember it all. I did weed, nicotine, alcohol. Still somehow managed almost straight A's, but that all fell when I started my first year of high school. I felt horrible. I was struggling, I felt trapped. I hated myself for things I couldn't control, for things that I could control but all I did was rot in my bed. That led to a decision that was impulsive and wrong. 
   I went to several mental health facilities before something finally clicked. I got closer to God. I started doing a little more than just surviving. I have plans for my life. I know my life is easily privileged, but I wanted to share this. If you're stuck in bed, not able to get up, lashing out, doing stupid dumb things. It does get better. I know it's hard to think so, you may think the whole world is laying on you, or something different of the sorts, but when I tell you it is never too late. Reach out, call a friend, go for a walk.

>!She bought a knife a while ago, claiming it was for self-defense. I know it wasn’t. I know her, I know she wants to kill someone. I know she wants to fuck the corpse and eat the meat. I know because she told me about it.!<

**(Graphic part over)**

We have specific triggers that bring her to the front, like TV shows such as NBC’s Hannibal, CW’s Batwoman, movies like Spider-Man (the ones with the Green Goblin or Venom), or situations like going out with our knife with the intent of actual self-defense. I think she sees herself in those medias, so I personally avoid them at all costs.

This fucking girl has cost us months of happiness, a happy engagement, and years of self-doubt before we knew we were a system. I am tired, I am scared, I need help… We need help.

I don’t know what to do, she is scary and knows that what she is doing is considered “bad”, she just doesn’t care or doesn’t understand why exactly that is bad. Please help us.

What is the universe trying to tell me? (TW: Trauma Dump) ,1,1.0,2024-06-09 22:49:28,"Ever since I was 11 years old I've been desperate to find my way out of my parents house due to how much traumas my mother have inflicted on me. Living with her in the same roof made my everyday life like hell.

At this point I can't even call her mother, it's too painful. (HER = mother)

At 16 years of age I found a job at a cafe to earn my own pocket money and lessen my burden of HER saying that I owe her my life big time because she gives me a house, bed, money, education, food and etc. I was proud that I took my first step of moving out courageously on my own. It was my opportunity to escape from home together with the dance group I recently joined that time.

Eventually finding another job opportunity at an entertainment company at 18, I was able to earn more. I was able to get the space and boundaries I wanted from HER, thus the weight has lifted a bit from my shoulder. Then promotion and opportunities came to me from the job and dance group.

And then  after I graduated my course's subj got harder to manage and I was starting to fall behind my attendance and submissions. Since my relationship with HER started to get better I thought I can rely and ask help from HER like one daughter should've experienced.

I decided to quit my job and ended my journey in the dance group to focus on my studies and career path since it is free and my parents are providing it for me. I wanted to become a good and helpful daughter with the support of my parents. Unfortunately, a week after my progress and motivation the University called HER regarding about my absences and late submissions. 

Then like the rain hiding under the clouds I fell back to zero and observed that sometimes people just really don't change and that the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb... and I'm back at the bottom where I started again... where everyday feels like a threat as I stay home and finish my assessments...

I’ve got everything I want but I feel so sad.,1,1.0,2024-06-09 22:21:58,"It’s been my (26f) dream to get a job in politics, and after a year of campaigning I have reached the first rung on the ladder in local government (not a major big deal but still an achievement). Additionally, in the last year I have moved in with my partner and we recently adopted a kitten. All three of these things have been big goals of mine for years. Therefore everything in my life is nearly perfect. The only thing is that in the last year I have gained a decent amount of weight but I’ve started swimming again so I know that will sort itself out. 

The thing is, I feel so depressed. It’s quite common to get post election blues because once all the adrenaline fades all the stress and worry catches up with you, you have to put your whole life on hold, you’re unable to see friends or family and your health usually suffers too. Plus the financial stress of it all because you don’t get paid by your affiliated party to run so unless you’re rich or retired you still have to work full time while doing it. 

As such, I haven’t really taken a break since last May and I can’t really now until next year as I used all my holiday up on the final weeks of my campaign. On top of this I have signed up to four different committees on our council, as well as being vice-chair and Social Media officer for my local party.

It feels like everything has suffered. I miss my family so much. I’m so anxious about seeing friends because I’ve always felt different from others but now it’s like I’ve forgotten about how to talk to people about things that aren’t deep philosophical questions, emotional support, law or politics. I’ve forgotten how to “just have a good time”. I’m scared that they won’t like me anymore or that I’ll just feel anxious the whole time about not fitting in or saying the wrong thing. 

My relationship has suffered a lot too. We still love each other a lot but it doesn’t really feel like we have much time together. It’s now his turn to shine, and alongside his full time job he’s now training to become a fully qualified teacher. This means that I want him to have his quality down time because he’s working so hard. His version of doing this is usually playing video games which isn’t the most social activity. Every now and then I’ll get into whichever game he’s into and I’ll try play with him but I’m not really into the game anymore. I get maybe 20-40 minutes with him while we eat dinner together and obvs we chat and stuff but I just don’t feel very connected to him anymore. He’s very happy in the relationship and because he’s got so much going on I don’t want to worry him because I do love him a lot but I just feel very lonely at the moment and I don’t want to add to his plate.

I’m someone where I’m happiest when I have something I’m actively working towards. I’ve always been very uncomfortable with “having to live in the now and focus on the moment”. My career can’t really progress now for another 5 years, I’m nowhere near getting married or having kids because we’re not exactly financially well off as we have both only really just stabilised ourselves in our careers. It’s like that feeling when you finish a good book, series, or game where you’re just like “what now?”.

Constant exhaustion ,1,1.0,2024-06-09 21:49:11,"I'm in the middle of my exams and I just couldn't bring myself to revise this weekend, it was like no matter how much I wanted too, I just couldn't, I came up completely blank on all of it. I tried to do maths and felt completely exhausted just looking at it, so I moved on to watching stuff I enjoyed, but that got dull quickly too. It's weird, like there's some kind of emotional gap right now which I can't bridge. I keep walking past mirrors and I can see that it's me, and I know that it's me, but for some reason I keep thinking that it'll be someone else entirely.

I have been having awful nightmares recently,1,1.0,2024-06-09 21:42:49,"Recently i've been having horrible psychologically torturing nightmares nearly everyday

In them everything always plays out like a normal day does, i use the internet, i go to work, i eat, drink, read and talk to people but at some random point in it something just snaps and the reality breaks with people just suddenly stopping and doing nothing but stare at me, after which it resets and i ""wake up"" inside of the dream as if i have just woken up for real and this plays out multiple times until every time i wake up i am nearly screaming and begging my family to take me to a hospital. I've never done that cause reality does kinda feel different than a dream and i dont want to bother them but i've recently started to get anxious that at any point reality might not be ""real"" and idk what to do, i cant exactly just not sleep and i dont think a doctor can help me with this in any way but i am still scared and it fucking sucks.

Cant ever relax,2,1.0,2024-06-09 21:39:46,"Ive come to realize that after dumping my mentally unwell ex, that he was not the only reason I was in a constant fight or flight state. Whenever one of my parents comes home, I get a noticeable change in mood and get the sensation I used to get when my ex was going to say something that upsets me, an intense chest pulling anxiety and I cant breathe. I have a weed pen and constantly feel the need to smoke till Im too high to care about my parents screaming at me all day, which is unhealthy. I don't want to hurt myself further by becoming dependent on weed to get through the day. 

Its summer break for my University and I literally cannot relax for more than 10 minutes because I'm constantly being called down to clean or yelled at.

Even when my parents aren't threatening me or yelling, I can never get out of fight or flight, which is what confuses me. I guess its just the possibility of being yelled at is causing the constant anxiety. If I try to bring this up, however, they don't remember ever being mean to me or yelling and if they do its because I ""won't listen"" unless they yell. 

Im 21 by the way. They still confiscate my phone, unplug the router, and confiscate my car keys. Im trying desperately to get a job so I can afford to move out but I haven't got even a rejection letter from the 20+ places Ive applied to. I know it would be so good for my health and I may be able to get off of SSRIs. 

I can move out when my University classes begin since my financial plan will pay for off campus (or on campus but ew) housing. I just need to have a job that makes me money to live off of. I'm not terribly convinced I'll be able to move out since I've been trying for years to no avail. 

On a lighter note, if I do get to move out, the first thing I'll do is get a senior cat.

Also, I have a psychiatry appointment set up with an new doctor soon, so I will have someone to tell this all to, this is just a vent.

"I've cried almost every night for a month because of loneliness, this is new for me, and I don't know how to stop it",1,1.0,2024-06-09 21:00:07,"not sure what subreddit to go to for a problem like this, sorry! this might not even be related to my depression and attachment issues, but I'm assuming it is. sorry if it's the wrong flair, too.

I'm a college student who lived on campus. two months ago, I entered my first relationship. I know there's bound to be more ""obsession"" and passion and longing in the beginning than, say, six months from now if we're still together. but I love them a lot. I have severe anxiety (bordering on paranoia at times), depression, really awful self-esteem, and I'm trying to get tested for autism. they've accepted me despite all of this.

we spent most nights together for the past semester, and most days as well. we'd be together for hours and hours just chilling. we're also both touchy af lol, so we'd cuddle a lot and sometimes fall asleep together.

but the semester ended last month, we're all on summer break now. I'm used to spending every day and night alone in my room at home (bad k-12 experience) but something feels very different this time. every night, when I get into bed and prepare to sleep... I cry. I have no control over it, it's like clockwork. lasts for 5-20 minutes. I can't identify why this is happening, aside from missing my new college friends and my partner most of all. (side note, I'm worried it's unhealthy to be this attached to someone after only knowing them for six months and dating for two! but I also doubt my judgment since I have trust issues)

last night, I called my partner, and everything was fine until we had to hang up and they told me good night. then I immediately began to cry, no buildup or warning. loneliness has never bothered me this much, idk if it's because I shut it out until now? but it hurts, it hurts so much, and break doesn't end until late August. it's been even worse for the past week because they're on vacation in another continent, but that logically makes no difference since we live 1-2 hours away from each other anyway!

-New neighbour downstairs already aggressively banging on the ceiling complaining about noise twice in the space of 24 hours. What should I do?,1,1.0,2024-06-09 20:56:46,"Hi there so i’ve been living in my flat for about a year and a half now. The downstairs flat has been vacant for a few months due to renovations. I wasn’t even aware somebody had moved in until I heard massive aggressive banging last night when I dropped some shoes at about 2am. It was obvious someone was complaining on me being too loud. So I proceeded to be a lot more quiet as i’be been quite relaxed because of the vacancy.

Fast forward to this evening I was trying to put up some blackout blinds and in the space of about half an hour I dropped 2 items by accident. The second Item I dropped was my wifi box which immediately followed with really aggressive banging again.  It’s been stressing me out as now I feel I have to tiptoe and worry about everything I do. The floors are so thin and bouncy and you can hear all the washing machines from all the flats it’s a 3 storey building. It’s literally impossible not to be loud. The guy upstairs is really loud at night but I’ve just learn’t to try to ignore it because of how bad the floors are. And not to mention that i’m not a cunt. 

So basically I thought about going downstairs and introducing myself and just apologising however i’m torn because if they couldn’t just come upstairs and talk to me like an adult then why should I bother? Instead I was met with just aggressive banging even from even littlest of things which I really can’t control. I’m being more aware of how I am in the flat. I’ve logged the accounts just incase it keeps happening so if I ever need to make a complaint.

I struggle really bad with mental health and get stressed out very easily from people yet I feel like this person is being really unreasonable and aggressive. Any advice? Should I go and speak to them? I’ve heard how they talk on the phone and they don’t sound the most pleasant or friendly person to deal with. I’ve no idea what I would be walking into but already.

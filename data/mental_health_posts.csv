My daughter is scaring me tonight. No idea how to help.,923,0.98,2023-12-09 02:50:29,"My daughter (10) very suddenly this evening said she feels like she's in a dream/ like she's not real/ like she's a ghost. Said she feels like she's going to die. She doesn't look great, almost like she's sick, but she says she isn't sick except for feeling like she's going to die. Her pulse is normal.

I had her take a shower, brushed her hair and she put on her jammies. Tucked her bed with beach sounds and told her to relax and picture being at the beach. Walked in a couple of minutes later and she's crying.

I'm really worried but completely clueless. My husband thinks it's her ADHD/Adderall, but this has never happened before. She has been very moody and temperamental lately.

My mother having sex with me in the same room damaged my relationship with sex,610,0.97,2023-10-09 21:59:43,"When I was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend. Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.

I think I have PTSD from my wife giving birth.,457,0.95,2024-01-08 17:37:47,"Let me start with I know that what a woman goes through in labor is incredibly hard and challenging on them both mentally and physically. 

So my wife got induced Friday morning and things progressed fine all day. They gave her an epidural at 4PM Friday and things were good. Around midnight the baby’s heart rate dropped which caused my wife’s to drop.. 

We had every nurse on the floor in our room in seconds. They flipped her on hands and knees, woke the on-site surgeon and started prepping the OR and a crash team. They got her and the baby stabilized in about 15 min. So that was at midnight. 

She labored through until it caused too much stress on her body so they sedated her and put her on oxygen for a few hours around 4 AM Saturday. She progressed to a little over 9cm. 

Around 9:30AM Saturday she gradually stopped having contractions and essentially going backwards.

 They ended having to doing an emergency c section at 11ish. 

When the baby came out he wasn’t breathing and didn’t for the first 5 min. They had to resuscitate him all the while they had a hard time stopping my wife’s bleeding. So. Much. Blood…. It was all over.. The drs discovered some infection while they had her opened up and had to look for more infection which took them longer. I watched them pull my wife’s insides out asking for help with the bleeding and the NICU nurses flip my child’s lifeless body around to get him breathing. 

So I bounced around the operating room  between my wife and child checking on them for like 20 minutes being completely helpless. 

Both baby and mama have gotten the all clear and are at home recovering. No immediate issues with either of them.  I know it’s silly to be upset because we came home and are doing okay when so many people don’t get that opportunity. I just can’t get the OR out of my head. It’s playing over and over.

I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],439,0.96,2023-08-18 20:25:32,"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected. 

*The point for this post is that I DO NOT want to go mentally insane from everything that happened. I do not want to wake up one day in the mental hospital. My mental state is very shaky right now. Please help me , I don't know how but please help me. I don't want to lose my health*

it was all consensual in the moment, like i never told him no, but thinking back on it i feel like he took advantage of the mental state i was in, and his position of power to get what he wanted. it feels like when a police officer gets with someone they arrested.

And the loneliness is REAL (even when you’re in a happy relationship). And being an adult in general is just difficult. Groundhog Day every day.

"How do I explain my burnout to ""youre just lazy"" people?",400,0.95,2023-08-24 15:55:13,"Not only burnout, I also have depression. I'm 23.

I don't have a job. I could theoretically work a job, but I would not perform well at the job at all and possibly get fired for being unproductive, it would also do more harm than good to me. But the main reason I don't have a job is because a job would drain my time and energy, which I desperately need to work on my physical and mental health and also my to-do list at home, I just cannot handle any more responsibilities currently. Its too much, im already fighting a battle 24/7 and I do not wanna attempt to work even harder than what is physically possible.

So now I often get judged ""you are 23 why dont you have a job??"" or ""you should be studying""

""you should"" ""why dont you"" but when I reply that I don't have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do, they reply that I'm just lazzy and privileged.

I guess that someone who has always been mentally healthy cannot understand what it feels like to be unmotivated, to be physically tired or mentally, to have a brain that does not function well, to wake up tired even after 9 hours of sleep.

 I flipped and punched him and started shouting at him that ‘he isn’t allowed to act like he’s better than me after raping her’.

 I felt weird about it but didn’t say anything. I would also lay down in the bed with her and she would start touching my inner thighs but nothing further. Also, she would make me and my brothers rub her feet but she would make weird moaning noises and said that she had a foot fetish. She also made a weird joke about how she would show me what it’s like to get molested and tried taking my clothes off jokingly?? I remember being very uncomfortable.

When I was around 14, I told her that I had a boyfriend and she slammed me on the ground and made me tell her information about him and would not let me go. 

 Also, (last month) I was dealing with issues with constipation and she bought me this laxative device that you have to stick in your butt to do. I have trauma from that era specifically because I was raped in July and she knows that, she even knows that specific area is just a source of trauma. But, she made me take off my pants and kept insisting that she put it in her for me. I kept saying no and that I would do it myself but she kept pushing me.

**UPDATE**
So we are divorcing. He told me he wants to sleep with other women on his vacation so I’m done with him.  I’m going to keep this post up since it gives people a chance to share there stories. I really appreciate everyone for this stories and their good luck wishes. I wish you all the best and pray you overcome this hard time in your lives.

What are y’all’s telltale signs that you’re in a depressive episode?,328,0.99,2024-03-08 22:21:12,"Sometimes the signs can be subtle, but I feel like a lot of people have one big thing that clues them into the fact they are definitely in a depressive episode. 

For me, I think it’s probably not caring enough to even have 2 full meals in a day, and keeping the light off for almost the entire day without opening my blinds. 

I feel like sharing these can also help other depressed people maybe realize what their signs are and help them deal with it as best they can once they recognize the signs.

My parents were having sex next to me and it fucked me up,318,0.94,2023-09-08 07:50:07,"Hi guys. Just wanted to vent a bit about some of my childhood traumatic experieces.
When I was a child my parents had been having sex next to me in the same bed. My first memories are from around when I was 5 years old. They were doing it thinking I was asleep but I was too scared to tell them I am not and that I see and understand everything. I started then to make some noises during their sex so they could feel uncomfortable and they stopped doing it since I was about 7 because they moved me into my own room.
The thing is that it made me sexual way too young. I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...
I feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.

Update: Thank you all for such a support. I feel much better after reading your comments about the fact I was just a child and is not my fault I wasn't taught about sex and what's right and what's not. I also want to mention that I am a female and already an adult, it was more than 20 years ago but I kept this within myself for a long time because of shame and guilt I felt. Thank you for this opportunity to open up and be heard.

I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,313,0.98,2023-05-27 01:36:58,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

Found out my daughter is cutting herself,304,0.99,2023-04-25 02:45:47,"I (32F) just found out my (13F) daughter is cutting herself. She said it’s been going on for a little more than a week. Her brother was the one who told me.

She showed me them and they are superficial and don’t need immediate medical attention.

I tried to remain calm and just not overreact or panic. I let her know that I’m sorry she was feeling so strongly that she resorted to hurting herself and I let her know that I don’t think badly of her and I want to help her.

She agreed that she would like to get help so we are going to get a referral from her doctor for a therapist on Wednesday.

She said she does it to relieve stress and when she’s feeling upset but that it isn’t a suicide attempt. I let her know that we need to find another way for her to release stress since this is dangerous.
I took her with me to work and school today so we could spend some extra time together. 

I’m not sure what else I can do. I’m trying to keep it together but I do feel terrible that she is feeling so low. I wish I could take all her pain away.

Edit: *Update*
Thanks for all the support! Even though I tried my hardest to do what was best it still felt like I wasn’t doing enough so it was very reassuring reading through everyone’s comments and experiences. 

We got a referral from her pediatrician so now we are waiting for therapy. In the mean time we have been doing more activities together and she has been a lot more open to trying stuff. 

Yesterday was rough because I spent some one-on-one time with my son (9) and she felt a little betrayed after we were spending so much time together. At first she didn’t want to talk to me but eventually she came around and I told her it’s normal to feel that way and she’s still important even if I spend time with her brother. 

My son has ADHD (and possibly autism, we are in the process of getting an evaluation) so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside. It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn’t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don’t allow children under 15. 

She even stopped wearing her jacket which I felt like was huge so I think we are making good progress.

What the fuck did my older brother just do?,306,0.95,2024-03-30 19:59:59,"Hello. I'll post this because I am really... utterly disgusted and in disbelief of what just happened. I might delete this later or whatever, I don't use reddit that much.

For context, I'm F18. I left our home at the age of 17 to enter a state university miles long away from our home. It takes me months to return home and I came back for a week long vacation (for long holidays) last Monday. Since I will be returning back to the city I'm currently studying in tomorrow, I wanted to at least bond and catch up with my older brothers since I've been away for months. We weren't that close, but I understood them more now since I've accepted to just let things be (again for context, my older brother stopped in college and currently out of school youth).

I was with them (my siblings' room), we were having fun, my 2nd older brother [M21] was in the lower bunk bed and me and my oldest brother [M22] was together in the top bunk. We were laughing and all, playing games, then my brother hugged me while I was playing games in his phone while we were also chatting. It looked sweet to me because we were not really touchy, he's introverted, and I innocently thought that we're getting closer. While having fun chatting and all, he kept on caressing my stomach and asked where's my navel at, and he touched, caressed it so much that I felt gross and laughingly told him not to touch it while still playing the game. 

He then on proceeded to fucking ask ""where should I touch you then"" and unhesitatingly put his fucking disgusting hands on my chest LIKE IT WAS FUCKING NOTHING and whispered ""here? can I touch you here? please let me"" LIKE A FUCKING UNEDUCATED CREEP. I was so grossed out and can't think properly at the moment so I chose laugh it off and got out of their room saying I'm sleepy already and needed to rest since I still have a long travel for tomorrow.

It was so, so fucking creepy since I didn't expect my brother to be like that. In context, my 2nd older brother is just the same. He also did something like that when I was a minor. And I was raped when I was in preschool. I know nothing at that age, but I remember it until now. I allowed that person to do it because I know nothing... I really don't know nothing. I was so vulnerable. I was just a child. When my parents asked why my medical results says that there was blood in my vagina and all, I was so nervous, scared, and got angry at them. I didn't understand it, but in my mind I was so scared if they knew (it's like having sex and telling your parents you had sex at that age). Looking back, it was so gross and I just wanna cry. I don't want to elaborate it further about what happened afterwards. I tried to forget... even until now.

Please... please help. I've been through a lot. Not just this but things way worse than an 18-year-old should experience. Please help me😭 what should I do it felt so fucking, fucking gross like it won't ever fade away even if I scrub all over my body and bath again and again. I feel so dirty. I am so fucking mad right now. I was reminded with everything. Am I still supposed to understand, knowing that these guys know no shit? I AM SO MAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I WANT TO CUT MY WR1ST AGAIN FOR DISTRACTION I CANT WITH THIS FUCKED UP LIFE IT'S HOLY WEEK FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS😭

TW: What they don't tell you about hanging yourself,296,0.99,2023-11-05 18:11:10,"A much needed premise: I miraculously survived hanging myself back in February of this year.

It was not the first time I attempted unaliving myself but it was the first time I was actually going to be successful if things hadn't turned out the way the did.

I had done my research about this. I could not fathom doing it any other ways that I thought were ""too painful and gory"", either for me or for the person who would find me.

So, after that, I was hospitalized for a month and a half and they changed my meds after 3 years and I have to say I am now in a much better mental state and ready to talk about this.

If you ever thought about doing this you may have a picture in your head of how it's going to go. I had it too and it couldn't be further from the truth of what happened.

So here's the reality check:

Firsts things first, it is not ""painless"" at all, it is not ""slowly drifting to sleep"". Your body will get SO MAD that you are doing this and it will react in the worst and most painful ways possible.

To start, you won't have control over your limbs. I remember seeing my arms in front of me with the hands all tensed up like a zombie. It felt like my tendons were slowly getting shorter and shorter and I couldn't move them. I always thought when the survival instinct would kick in the arms would go up to the rope in an attempt to lift yourself up. And it's true that your brain will think that, but trust me, you will have NO CONTROL over your movements. You want to lift the arms up overhead and they just slap around aimlessly.

Then you will feel like your head is going to explode and your eyes are going to pop out. I felt my whole face go warmer and warmer and starting to tingle like crazy.

And that's not even the worst part: it was the lungs for me. You see, your body will get to a state of primal survival instinct where it will do anything it can to just catch a breath. But since the airways are blocked, your whole torso will tense in and out with so much force that your lungs and stomach hurt like hell. Think of a worm curling up when you touch it. Your body will do the same over and over, in and out, each movement more and more painful than the previous one. And it's not like you can control it. You can't. My whole abs and back muscles hurt as if I had fallen from 3 stories for like 2 weeks afterwards just from the effort my body was making by trying to get some oxygen.

I won't even go into how it ends because it's just fucking scary. I'll just say that there's a point where you have the lucid thought of ""I am dying, and there's nothing I can do about it"". And it's the most terrifying yet real feeling ever. It's not ""calm and peaceful"" like you make it out to be in your mind before doing it. It's sheer panic. And when you have this thought it's like it lasts a millisecond but you're now stuck in this state that doesn't leave you.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I feel like some people need to hear this. I certainly would have had second thoughts had I known it in advance.

I won't go into how I survived because I honestly still feel guilty and embarrassed about it. Just know I had to be resuscitated twice and can't remember a thing after that panic feeling. That would have been the last feeling I ever felt. Not peace, not relief.

I am now convinced there's absolutely no ""painless"" way to go and I'm scared as hell for when it will be my time to go in the future. I still have these feelings sometimes, to end it all but I have to admit I am now an official coward.

So yeah, would not recommend. It was NOT worth it. Just delay that feeling for as long as possible, trust me.",mentalhealth,None,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/17ohtpv/tw_what_they_dont_tell_you_about_hanging_yourself/,27,298.989898989899,2.989898989899018,0.000637832871453986

In that time I watched him do an insane amount of work on himself. We both have mental illnesses but we both see doctors and take our meds. He had some kind of mental break a few days ago. We went to the doctor. Then the hospital (I was flabbergasted they didn’t admit him). Last night it all went to hell. He got hyper fixated on my son. I was very concerned so I called his grandma to take him back to the hospital because I was going on three nights mo sleep watching over him. He thought my my 21 year old son was in his room with his (my partner’s) ex girlfriend. He kept running up to his room insisting he needed help. I managed to get him outside and made my son lock himself in the house. 

Then it came to a head. He started ranting and raving and screaming. I tried everything. I tried pretending like he made sense. I tried begging. I tried singing. Finally I saw his Mamaw pulling in. Then my partner, the man whom until a few days ago I had never even had a real argument with pounced on me. We went down and starting grappling. My glasses flew off.

Please Stop Recommending Pets as a Mental Health Fix,284,0.96,2023-10-04 18:52:42,"I’ve seen this several times under a lot of posts on this Reddit, and I’m not saying pets don’t help. I don’t want to discount the experiences of people who says pets have helped with their mental illnesses, and I don’t want to discredit scientific studies that suggest having a pet elevates your mood.  However, a pet is a living creature that requires a lot of care, and if you are so depressed it is hard to keep up with your responsibilities, a pet might add to your stress rather than helping relieving it. This really reminds me of those couples who fight and fight and they think having a baby will fix their relationship. 

Please remember that pets aren’t props used to help humans, they are living creatures with their own feelings and needs. I don’t want to discourage you from getting a pet, but please only get one if you can take care of it, not just to help with your mental health.

My friend says he’ll never forgive me because I called the authorities for a welfare check after he told me he was contemplating suicide,283,0.95,2023-04-23 13:46:18,"

This morning, one of my best friends called me and was in tears. He spoke about frustration and suicidal ideation. As someone who suffers bipolar disorder, I completely  understood his pain and where he was coming from. I tried to calm him down but then he hung up on me. The last thing he said was “I’m really sorry. You won’t hear from me again very soon. Thank you for everything”
And then for thirty minutes, I tried to reach out to him but I couldn’t. I travelled out of the state for the weekend and I’m 3 hours away. He stays alone and I don’t know any of his neighbors so I was forced to ask the authorities to go to his house for a welfare check. 
They did and determined he was fine. He then called me and said he would never speak to me again or forgive me for doing that. But I couldn’t live with myself leaving him alone after talking about killing himself. I feel horrible like I betrayed his trust but another part of me feels like I did the right thing and maybe potentially saved his life. 
What do I do? He’s not relying my texts or calls. Should I go over to see him when I’m back? Should I keep trying to call and text him?

Not coping from hearing my parents “doing stuff” at night,277,0.96,2023-10-19 23:38:58,"This is gonna sound so weird and creepy I’m sorry I don’t know what to do I really hate how I feel about it and I don’t know who else to tell. Around two years ago or so around covid lockdown time my dad was heavily drinking a lot, he did before and that’s a whole problem in it’s self but I was home to witness it a lot. There was a period of about a month when when he was drunk he would come up in the middle of the night and force himself on my mum , he is already a control freak so me and my brother can’t close our doors and he would keep theirs open too even though out rooms are next door. Basically every other night I would hear this and it would give me breakdowns every time crying panicking and not knowing what to do with myself. For some time I tried to intervene cause I felt horrible for not doing anything which just made it 10x worse and ended up with him threatening to kill me if I ever did it again and our already bad relationship being worse. I tried to talk to my mum she did admit sometimes she didn’t want to (I have physically heard him push her down and her saying no) but she gave me the sex is good talk and told me to leave it and stop intervening. Once it drove me crazy to the point of self harm just hearing it made me feel so sick and I just needed any type of distraction from the sound , it doesn’t help that past 11pm I cannot be awake or watching tv so it’s hard to drown out the noise. That was around 2 years ago now I still live at home and I’m 18 now my dad has stopped drinking but our relationship is unfixable even when I hear anything remotely similar I start that crying and panicking again sometimes it feels like I’m making up the noise in my head and it’s been happening on and off for two years.

My 21F ex has slept with my 20M friend and I am not ok.,267,0.96,2023-07-27 14:32:12,"Long story short, me and my ex lived together over a year and as things were ending, my friend came to live with us as he was starting a life in the area. Shortly after, me and my ex broke up and he decided to stay and help her. She struggles a bunch mentally and really needs someone to stay with her so I didn't find this to be a bad idea.
They eventually started to get super close and I started asking them if they ever might get together. I was wanting to be prepared in case they ever did. My ex claimed that she's not gonna say no and doesn't want him out of her life if he brings her happiness. Yesterday, we were talking more about it and it pretty much came up that they have slept together.


What really hurts is that me and her had a unhealthy relationship and that we hadn't had sex in over year due to what we thought was her mental problems. Due to this and some other factors, I started acting distant in the relationship and she believes that was holding her back from wanting to be physical with me for the last year.


When I found out they have slept together it sent me into a huge panic attach basically running and crying into the woods. Right now I keep picturing them sleeping in the same bed that me and her used to sleep in and it creates the absolute worst feelings I've ever experienced.

Be honest: How often do you think about su*c*de?,253,0.96,2024-03-24 19:26:29,"I know this is a sensitive topic and I am even afraid to talk about it with my therapist

I honestly have no idea if it is normal to think about su\*cide as often as I do. Like not really attempting it, not even being close to doing it. Just thinking about it.

Since forever planning my su\*cide in depth somehow calmed me. Whenever I feel stressed or anxious I think of different ways how to do it and somehow this is the only thing that calms me. Most of the time I think daily about it, on the way to work, when doing housework etc

Your therapist really does care about you. 

Every time we see you accomplish something or overcome something, we are filled with pride. 

Every time you share your pain with us, we always take a little bit of that home with us. 

We think about you outside of sessions. 

Sometimes we worry ourselves to the point of losing sleep over you. 

You don’t “annoy” us. 

Every time you share a trauma that’s hard for you to talk about, we feel honored.

Sex is disgusting sometimes- I think I might know why?,230,0.92,2024-04-03 14:50:17,"I lived with my dad for a little period of time and did always go to his cottage whenever I was off school. One thing was- he would always fuck his girlfriend/wife at the time very loudly. At some point I started getting really annoyed by it because I would storm out of the house screaming “STOP having sex when I’m here”. It kept happening. I was glad it happened in a different room but you don’t understand how SMALL this cottage was. I could hear everything and that girl would do it on purpose so I could hear it.  They would do it in their room and do it in the bathroom. It echoed so much. 

It was always the have loud vigorous sex, come out of the room with such confidence and going to the kitchen table to have a cigarette and a coffee. That’s the pattern. Daily. Constantly.

I knew she did it on purpose because my relationship was always terrible with the girl. She was jealous of a young girl because my dad loved me. I was jealous of her because I knew she didn’t deserve my dad and that she was pushing him away from me.

I think it got to a rotten point where I got myself off on it because I was so used to it happening every night. I think this part is what is getting me... I was only 11/12-13 at the time doing all of this. It only continued from there until I moved out. There was nothing I could do but wait on the couch and sleep there until it was over. I didn’t realize how fucked up it was to do what I was doing. But truly -because I was so exposed that -I thought it was normal to do so. I think it’s affected me even now just because of what they did- and what I’ve done while that was all happening. I feel cursed. Disgusting. Confused. Vile. Sad. Desensitized. Not normal.

I continue to think about it Til this day, and it grosses me out and sometimes it will pop up in really awkward moments. I feel a rise of anger when I hear any form of moaning or sighing- I get scared or weirded or grossed out while trying to have sex. I will have flashbacks when having sex. I get fear from it sometimes. I hate to be touched sometimes- and it has a lot to do with this.

-I’ve also been through some weird instances where my dad would slap my ass “as a joke”. Who does that all the way up til they’re 13?
- I used to be laying on the couch and I swear to god at some point he was watching porn around me. He was doing it in the kitchen at the table. I know this because I heard the moaning and at the time there was only me and him around the cottage 


-stumbled onto my dads only laptop and found a bunch of legging porn videos.. also stumbled onto his only camera and found nudes of his gf. I’m finding all of this at the age of 11-13 years old.

-edit: my dad and the girlfriend left me alone a lot with the girlfriends son and daughter at the time. The daughter same age as me and the son 16. At the time I was 13. we were in my dad’s girlfriend’s cottage. The son had a few drinks and he started to give me a small amount of attention and sleazily asked me to be his girlfriend that night. Later on he pressures me into giving him a BJ and I do it because I want a boyfriend - and the morning after he breaks up with me. Stone cold. I actually thought we were gonna be together but he actually just used me- then becomes my step brother  a few years after. I think I got really lucky for being the heavier/ fat girl at the time because it would take a lot more for him to take MORE advantage of me than he already did. It was my FIRST memorable sexual experience that was NOT good. He kicked me out of the room right after he couldn’t nut.

I also have a faint memory of being around the age of 5 and playing with a younger boy and we were in a closet stripping. Thankfully we got caught. I asked my mom and my sister if that ever happened because clearly the other mom probably would make a scene out of it knowing what just happened - but they both said they don’t recollect this at all. I think I’m going insane with this guilt of being so young but also pushing myself onto another person that way.

It just gets really fucked up. Also people think this is a LARP.. which is really really sad. Because this legit has happened. What am I lying about for. I smoke weed daily just to not cry- I have self harm scars from when I was ten just from crying for ANY form of attention. I have physical and mental regrets throughout everything I’ve been through. I can’t lie.

I finally got a therapist that’s good at her job and now I am livid.,204,0.99,2023-07-07 20:05:33,"Alright, I got a story for y’all. 

I had an eye opening therapy session yesterday, and I just wanna share about how I never realized things that happen to us as a child can have such lasting subconscious impacts on us for the rest of our lives. 

Ima bout to get real with y’all, and share an experience that happened to me. 

This is something I have a suppressed memory about it, and because of the way adults have portrayed it to me growing up, I always told it as a haha funny story. These fvckers spoke about it as if it were a joke and now I’m angry.

Something about me, is if I ever feel as though I’m in trouble I shut down. I go non verbal, and it’s hard to come out of. Therapist asked about it, and when I first felt that as a child. I first said something about being put in the corner as a child and if i talked I had to stay longer. But then it hit me. 

As a child, I had pretty bad adhd (still do) and would never stop talking. Got on a lot of people’s nerves. So, one night a relative was babysitting me. I was younger than 5. (Likely around 3/4) I wouldn’t stop talking and bothering her. 

So what does this relative do? Duck tapes my hands and feet to a bed and put tape over my mouth, and left me in a room until my mom came back to get me. 

My mom was livid. Unfortunately she’s passed since so I can’t ask her about it. 

After that, adults, my father included would ride around with duck tape on the dash of their cars and threaten me with it if I misbehaved. 

Every time that story was brought up by the people in my life, it was told as a funny story, so that became my association with it. To this day, it’s brought up as a funny memory. 

I just never made the connection before about it. 

But now, having my own kids and thinking about someone doing that to my toddler, nah I’d be in jail right now. 

That’s not even the worst of what’s happened to me as a child, but now I just want to call my father and tell him with as much disrespect as I can give, Fvck you.

I found my mother dead yesterday,199,0.99,2023-07-24 07:23:54,"I (21F) found my mother (56F) passed away yesterday morning outside in her chair. She was suffering from terminal lung cancer and was in horrible daily pain. She had gotten her diagnosis just a few months ago, and although it was terminal my family wasn’t expecting her to go so soon. We really thought we’d have a lot more time with her. We actually had a cookout planned that day so the family could come over and spend time with her. I can’t get the image of her slumped over in her chair out of my head. Seeing her pale face and my heart just stopping. Trying to wake her up even though I knew she was gone. I feel so numb and I don’t understand why. I feel like I should be crying more but I just can’t anymore. Nothing feels real. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. It doesn’t feel fair. I feel like I’ve been robbed. I have so much anger I don’t know where to direct. My mother didn’t deserve to die so early nor should anyone have to lose their parent so young. These past few months leading up to this I’ve been in a depressed haze, cutting off friends and isolating myself. I was starting to feel the loneliest I’d ever felt in my life but now I think this is it. I have nobody to talk to about this. I’m just so sad. Support or advice would be appreciated.

UPDATE: I don’t use Reddit much so I’m not sure if everyone who replied will get notifications for this: 

I just wanted to post a update and thank everyone who has taken their time to comment and reach out .  you guys have no idea how much all this support has meant to me. These past few hours have been extremely rough. I’m not going to lie, I’m still a bit numb. I just can’t believe my mother, the women I’ve known my entire life is gone. I will never see her again. It shatters my heart all over again every time I’m reminded. My mother was the most caring and beautiful women I’ve even known. The morning she passed, she woke me up very early at 2am asking if I was okay. This was very unlike her. I’d like to think in some way she knew what was coming and wanted to spend some time with me before she left. My best friend and I recently reconnected right before my moms passing, they have been keeping me company which has been really helpful. Surprisingly I’ve been laughing a lot these last 2 days more than crying. I think my mom would have wanted that for me. Although I’m still incredibly lonely and depressed about her passing, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. As my mother is no longer suffering in pain, she’s completely at peace now and where she always wanted: in the afterlife with my grandparents ❤️ 
Again thank you to all the amazing wonderful people who took their time to leave me heartwarming advice and share their experiences. I was losing hope in humanity for the longest time but posting my experience here  has brought me nothing but peace and encouragement. You all are the most wonderful people imaginable and I can’t thank you enough. I really didn’t expect so many people to see this.

My psychologist told me something I wish my parents had told me,190,0.99,2023-05-31 12:44:17,"I'm 36(m), and I went to my first ever therapy session ever. I've been battling depression, anxiety, and stress for almost my whole life. I have my good days and bad days, and it has been a terrible 6 months. 

I opened up to my therapist at first, just snipits of my days and issues, and it turned into an hour of me spilling my heart out and overloading her with information. 

I knew I had dyslexia and showed signs of ADHD, and it has been left untreated since childhood, and now it is affecting me even with the simplest of tasks. 

She said that I have a thinksy mind that overthinks and over exaggerates simple things. She went on explaining it all and trying to help me rewire my thinking. 

Then she said something I didn't expect, she said it was not my fault that I could learn those topics in school, it wasn't my fault that I could not understand those math equations. It wasn't my fault that I couldn't pay attention for 8 hours straight in a jail cell like room. That I wasn't dumb or stupid because others didn't understand what I was going through.

Wife is going through breakdown and told me she wants to divorce,190,0.98,2023-09-17 17:59:09,"My wife of almost 15 years (we have been together for 21) decided she wanted to divorce me suddenly before a work trip. She knew I was going alone and would be isolated. 

I spent the first few days in a hotel room in a strange country in complete shock. All the emotions ran through my head. I blamed myself, every little comment said. 

A few years ago she suffered from an incredibly paranoid phase (thanks a lot pandemic) where she thought the neighbours were spying on her and everyone was out to get her. I work away a lot so I'd come home to find her in this state. The ""cameras"" always ended up being garden lights or motion activated lamps, but when I pointed this out (after 6 months not so tactfully) she seemed to withdraw from me. 

After that we had a yoyoing relationship, where she would tell me one moment she loves me, the next a divorce. We always sorted it out because I love her and want to support her and the kids unconditionally. 

I noticed her withdrawing. She would be in the same room with me, but not in spirit. She would explode at me in anger for the smallest things, and the big things she wouldn't seem to care about. 

She decided to go on medication, which helped. Although she became more of a robot and lost all interest in any form of intimacy. It broke my heart. 

She came off of them about a year ago and things started to improve. We became physical (although at the worst of times she would have sex with me and throw it in my face on the next angry outburst, calling it rape etc. I never forced her into sex at all, but did complain we weren't intimate many times). 

So, this latest situation was only three days ago. I'm still in a hotel halfway across the world, but my father rang me this morning. 

Apparently she stayed at a female friend of ours house last night because she thought the neighbours were spying on her. She told me that she is hated in the area and that she will be sent back to her home country (she has been living in the UK for over 20 years and is from Europe) and the kids taken away. She strongly believes it to be true. 

My father picked her and the kids up and she adamantly wanted to report everything to the police regarding it. The police obviously didn't take it seriously. Our neighbours are all 80'ish years old and not malicious. A pain, but not malicious. 

So as I sat here, pulling the threads on everything bad I'd done (because she will often use anything I've done wrong as ammo) when I get a call saying a mental health nurse is visiting her. She's at my Dad's with the kids. 

I love her with all my heart. She's a fantastic mother and person. But she will just torture me over and over and I stay because of this love. I worry about the kids and how she'll cope. It breaks my heart. 

So I just carry on working, supporting her and trying to build our family. I've turned into a persuer it seems, trying to hold us all together. Always initiating conversations. Trying to understand her feelings. She wouldn't make the effort to talk first. 

Did she really mean she wanted a divorce? Or is this just symptoms of her MH? I can't leave her when she needs me, and although this is effecting me I can take it. I want her to be safe and feel better but she's breaking me down with the constant swings in feelings towards me.  She is an amazing person at her best, but at her worst it's like Jekyll and Hyde. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so what was the outcome?

*Edit*

I was arrested straight off the plane. They aarested me on suspicion of Rape and coercion.  I was taken straight to the police station and was just released pending investigations.

I've picked my car up, but I'm not allowed to contact her, go to the house without police escort, go to her place of work (which I wouldn't) go to the school. Where my kids attend or ask anyone to talk to her for me.

I've never raped her. She thinks having sex because she felt guilty whilst not objecting is rape because she didn't really want it. She's saying this happened multiple times. I'm feeling broken

Looking at the past history, I think she has BPD. The re-writing of the past, the annoyances at very minor things. Disassociation and acting. Obviously this isn't a proper diagnosis, but reading it all was a lightbulb moment.  I think I've been discarded.

Saying I needed to go.

I know i put myself in that position, I let myself get taken advantage of and I know that I was the stronger person and could have stopped it.

I wonder if I even AM worried at all. Lately I’ve been feeling apathetic towards my mental issues/habits. Hell, I don’t even feel annoyed/bothered by the things that usually annoy/bother me. The worry feels fake, I think. Then again, my “self-aware” thoughts tend to feel fake.

But anyways, I met this person on Discord and we both produce music. I showed them my music, they showed me theirs. They were fun to talk to, and it felt completely platonic. They asked me if I was an adult, and I said I was 19. They said they were fifteen. I don’t know if they’re male or female, but something hints at them being female.

Now, I don’t remember feeling any attraction to this right away, no, I don’t think I did. But I think my mind wants to convince me and say “what if you did feel attracted? Maybe you don’t remember.” 

I never fantasized/thought about them sexually or anything, ever. I don’t like to say it, but I did kind of feel a bit attracted, not even sexually. Of course, my mind doubts that and makes me wonder if I do/did feel attracted sexually. But I did daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually)?

The attraction felt more like a romantic one, not sexual. Still, that should bring concern, but I don’t feel concerned. I don’t even feel concerned that I don’t feel concerned. It seems like my mind keeps getting more and more messed up.

————————————————————————

It doesn’t stop here. I sometimes catch myself “looking” at much younger girls, and daydream of them being attracted to me (not sexually, more like attracted to my face and just my face), but this hasn’t happened in a long time. I sometimes avoid looking at them this way, and keep my eyes away and instead focus on their face (which doesn’t make me feel attraction, but of course I doubt this).

”Daydreams/fantasies” on my OWN never feature any underage people. 

And of course, I feel apathetic. But, I do think this whole issue is gonna make it a bit more difficult for me to enjoy things.  I wondered if I’d be able to enjoy dancing anymore, because “yeah that guy dances well, but he’s a pedo, so…”

—————————————————————————

If it’s any help, I’ve never used underage characters (like lolis for example) in things like AI chats, only actual adult characters. I’ve never used porn like jailbait porn or “barely legal” or anything like that.

And I am attracted to people my age. I just wrote “too,” but deleted it, and I think that means something.

I also always have the wrong reactions/opinions, like when people say pedophilia isn’t a sexuality, I feel opposed.

———————————————————————————


Edit: Nearly everyone here has told me it sounds like POCD, but I feel like it’s more than that. I can’t deny that I did daydream of little girls being romantically attracted, I can’t deny the attraction to that fifteen year old.

I told the fifteen year old that I couldn’t talk anymore. I then unfriended them. I felt something when I saw their profile, it was only romantic but mild, I think. Mild or not, it was romantic. It quickly went away once I no longer saw their profile, but still, it was there.

26F: cruel internal voice that relentlessly criticizes anything i think or do. anyone else struggle with this,169,1.0,2023-04-27 14:28:53,"Like if I think to go visit my parents the voice says, ‘you’re 26 and you want mommy and daddy, pathetic.’ If I don’t go see them it’s like, ‘Congratulations, do you feel like a big kid now?’

When I was working, it found a way to tell me whatever job I had was pathetic or that I was pathetic to be proud of myself for a job I actually liked. 

As I ease my way back into working after an especially bad depressive episode, that voice laughs at any small steps I take. Whether it’s waking up early or doing one freelance job, taking on a student. Little steps that feel manageable, that voice is laughing at me like ‘you want a fucking standing ovation every time you do the dishes?”

It’s out of line with my own beliefs about work and value but it completely takes over, like it has the microphone and I can’t think anything else and I am becoming so weepy and panicky.

Why do I get immensely sad when I see an unwanted inanimate object? Why am I like this?,170,1.0,2023-10-02 13:19:29,"Basically, if I see an inanimate object being unwanted (on sale, low reviews, put up for free, in the trash, etc.) I feel immensely sad.

This really only pertains to ""anthropomorphic"" objects. Plushies and the like are a good example of what I'm talking about, but if it has a face it's definitely a possibility that I'll feel bad for it. 

Not sure if it helps, but I have been diagnosed with GAD, C-PTSD, and interchangeably with dysthymia and depression. My therapist said that it may be in my best interest to speak with my doctor about an autism diagnosis as well.

I had a child loss. And I am okay.,162,0.97,2023-12-12 20:51:58,"Hi, about ten months ago (Feb) I had a miscarriage. I saw my dead baby. Yes, it wasn’t just a pile of cells. I’m pro choice, so whatever you would like to call it for yourself, then go right ahead, anyways. 

I’ve been struggling a lot. I loved them so much even though I didn’t know them well. I knew how they made me feel, and what they were doing to my body. I knew I was excited and loved them with my whole heart and body already. 

It took many months after my loss to finally name them. I never got the chance to know them well, so naming was hard. I decided to go with Jordyn or Jordie for short. 

The name Jordie comes from my cousin, who I love so much, and is one of my favourite people. And I love the name Jordyn, especially for a feminine person. 

I’m doing okay. I know that it’s not my fault. My baby wasn’t developing properly, and would have been born either very sick, and miserable, or passed away, like they were. 

They are at peace, and I’m coming to that point now. I miss them everyday. But I also have an amazing partner to help me through everything. 

I’m going to be okay. 
One day, I might meet them again, and who knows in what way?

No matter what, I know they wouldn’t blame me, because Jordyn was sick. 

I am still a parent. 
I am still a mother.

Edit: I identify as enby. They/them. Not a woman, but still a mama🩷🩵🩷

Edit 2: one in four pregnancies end in loss. It’s not as common to lose your baby in the second or third trimesters, but it is just as valid. I lost Jordyn in the second trimester. I was supposed to be 15 ish weeks pregnant, but when they passed away, they were only the size of a 7-8 week baby. I just felt like I wanted to share this information. 

I’m also going into grief counselling to help support myself with my journey of not being a mom anymore. There’s a quote that I really love, it goes like this:

“I carried you every second of your life, and I will miss you every second for the rest of mine.”🩵🩷🩵🩷

I also plan on having a funeral for Jordyn in the future, if I still have trouble with grieving. And that’s okay. They were loved, and still are. And even though they were sick, I still see them as perfect.

We found my grandma dead this morning and I feel like it's all my fault,165,0.99,2024-03-16 04:43:14,"My mom, grandma and I live together. Last night I was cooking food around 11:30pm. I swore I heard a woman for a split second. It was high pitched and startled me and I took my pan off the stove and listened intently and heard nothing. I texted my mom and asked if she was making noise . Didn't get a response and went to my studio area . Didn't fall asleep. At 4 30am my mom frantically ran to me and told me to hurry quickly. She had found my grandma in her master bathroom on the ground and needed help turning her over . I turned her on her back and she was dead. 
Blood came out her nose and mouth. Mom was on the phone with 911 . Gave her CPR . And she was just gone. She had been gone, she was cold with no pulse. Unexpected and out of nowhere.
She was fine last night. 

I feel guilty. I had the thought to check on her when I heard that noise because it had me frightened it was so strange of a sound. But I didn't want to wake her up and it was storming. There's 3 dogs in the house . I assumed it was in my head and it could of been. There was no sign she fell and hit her head or anything like that . It seemed she was probably gone when she hit the floor. But in my head and heart I keep saying what if I had went in there ... if I had maybe my grandma would be here still. I hate myself right now . This is the worst day of my life. I lost my papaw and that was bad. But this is something else... I was talking to her last night about how I'd lost weight and just chatting .

My mother hung herself in the woods yesterday.,161,0.98,2023-08-06 02:35:32,"This doesn't feel real and I am going through throwing up and being in denial. My mother suffered from bipolar but was pretty good at masking it around people for most of my life. I just turned 33 and as her daughter I never expected she would be out of my life forever at this age. This year has been terrible because something triggered a 10 day manic episode in January where she basically burned every bridge. Once it was over she couldn't get over the shame and fell into a deep depression. She was hospitalized multiple times but could only seem to be kind of act functional for a week or so back at home and then get so depressed again that she wouldn't eat or sleep. 

She moved in with me and I really thought I could help her but it was a cycle of her acting somewhat hopeful to a deep depression. Yesterday we got into an argument because I found out she has been lying about taking her meds. We exchanged some words and she got into her car and sped away. I really didn't think much of it and thought maybe she just needed space. After too many hours went by, my sibling and I started blowing up her phone. 

I finally filed a missing persons report while hoping she just went to a hotel or something. This morning the doorbell rang with two officers holding their hats. I already knew what they were going to say but they said they were very sorry but they found her body and she hung herself. My brain isn't processing this at all.

I think I fucked up by being honest to my professor...,162,0.95,2023-08-03 18:16:49,"Basically I emailed him asking a simple question about my grade. He asked me why I took ""so long"" to email him about this, because I only saw the grades right now, but they got released two months ago.

In 2 small paragraphs and 4 sentences in total I very briefly explained to him that I got in a delirium today from my cat getting lost and spiraling into a depressive episode from being in a very stressful environment (basically my friends treating me like their therapist). I explained I have issues for which I am on my way to get properly medicated for which causes me, among other things, extreme anxiety to see my grades, and that I hadn't seen my grades in general in almost a year. Therefore, getting in a delirium and becoming deeply unstable and barely holding onto reality, I decided that that moment was the safest one for me to see my grades, because I'd get the least shock from being most detached from reality.

Of course he hasn't responded, I don't expect him to, but I'm scared I fucked up by telling the truth when the truth is... this. I find it difficult in general to lie, but especially in times when I lose control. I was even preparing to lie to him just in case he'd ask me something like this, but I knew I had nothing to back up my lie. And being upfront was kind of the only way for me to actually justify being so late in emailing, because that's just the reality.

I just want to get my degree with my own dignity... I hope I don't make these people hate me forever for being like this and thus stop me from receiving what I study so hard for...

Edit: Before I go to sleep I want to clarify 2 things. Number 1 is that I don't judge my professor at all for not responding to me, I would do the same in such fragile situation. Number 2 is that for me, none of the information I shared were things I ""hide"" from anybody casually (not in a professional setting of course if not prompted). There's a myriads of other things I hide, which are way more severe and unsettling to the average Joe. Sharing *those* things for me would be considered **for my own boundaries** as oversharing, simply because the information I shared is almost my entire life. I have nothing to say about my life if it's not that, which just covers the surface. Of course my definition of oversharing may be objectively wrong, but that's my personal definition of it. But besides the open ended conversation that is naturally unfolding, my main concern is about type of emotions this information could evoke to the other person, such as falsely making them believe I lied, making me look inappropriate to work in the industry, making me look difficult to work with, etc.",mentalhealth,the-fourth-planet,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15hbkih/i_think_i_fucked_up_by_being_honest_to_my/,41,170.5263157894737,8.5263157894737,0.0003637824890604206

This initially started over quarantine because I was stuck in the same house as my family. They like to dig into your insecurities and even made me feel like I’m ugly, so I thought up a girl who doesn’t have those insecurities and was just all around beautiful and imagining what kind of life she would lead. The only one I’ll be going over in this post is “Sasha” which was a name I had liked due to being a big Bratz fan when I was younger and I had hated my name because it’s not very common and not only had an apostrophe, but also has a capital letter in the middle and was often made fun of. Since then, I have learned to love my name and switched her name to be mine. To better describe her and her life, she’s a beautiful dark skinned Afro-Latina woman who has long dark brown hair, she has an hourglass figure, and the most beautiful brown eyes in terms of looks and I often times will stay awake simply imagining her face and wanting to cry or scream. In terms of what she’s like, she has a very sweet personality, but she’s much more confident than me and takes crap from no one, she’s seen as the most perfect woman originally at school and later as an actress. She at some point got married to my dream man and they had kids who were practically the definition of perfection. That was originally just my little escape from reality, but it very quickly started consuming my day to day life because I’ll start thinking about this during important things or shut myself off from the world to get a quiet place to focus on how to make that world more so perfect.

Recovering from depression is worse than depression itself,163,0.98,2023-04-30 16:15:53,"I have been majorly depressed for years. During that time I lost relationships, took gap years from college, isolated, missed out on opportunities, gave up on everything I was talented it, and have led a life that I am not proud of. I never wanted to be around others because I knew that I was a burden to whoever I talked to. 


Now that I have in many ways made great strides toward recovery (or at least better coping mechanisms), I almost wish I hadn’t. Depression was comforting in a way. It filled some type of void. Now I look back at almost ten years of emptiness. I feel like dying would have been better because my life is like looking back on someone who was dead. I feel like my life is completely worthless. I understand that the sentiment that comparison is the thief of joy, but looking at the lives of others my age I don’t see the point. I feel like I will never have a full life, like I’ll always be behind. I’ve tried everything. This is one of the first times I’ve really allowed myself to process these feelings and it sucks but I do feel like I need to be honest with myself. Stuffing all this down and telling myself I’m happy just because I’m not depressed isn’t true. I’m not suicidal anymore but I truly do wish I would drop dead or something.

I'm a iraqi turkmen suffering alot and don't trust iraqi propaganda or kurdish propaganda 

Iraq is a hellhole

I suffer daily as a 13 year old

Poverty is quite common

Saddam added his image to all books and he persecuted turkmens

Urban areas are full of beggars

The education here is soooo shitty we get 60-80 hard exams yearly and 30 questions per exam 5 divisions of questions 

We have to read the whole book 200 pages and barely get anything out of it to become 'smarter' out of 1000 questions we memorize we only get 3% of those how useless

My father is exploited by the iraqi government and we can't even go back to our ancestral countries 

Any iraqis who are struggling seeing this i don't deny it because iraq is in bad condition socially 

Iraq has power cuts everyday and 6 times a day

The educational ministry brainwashed all turkic people here explains why they're patriotic 

Christians here aren't that persecuted but 2 governorates najaf and karbala persecute them and teach them their propaganda 

Iraqi conquerors killed 100000 central asian turks and raped 50000 and forced them to join the army and become arabs, this is also the reason why many iraqi turkmens support the siege of baghdad 

If you're wondering why us iraqi turkmens don't seem to be related to iranian turkmens is because we're iranian azeris

My turkic brothers are any of you here for me

I often feel negativity towards iraqis


The education here is VERY manipulative it explains why kids are patriotic

If you do not raise a iraqi flag during a mawtini performance then the school will beat you

And kurds here make policies harming us using fake information and they've kurdified many turkmens in erbil and they stole jarmo from kerkuk and called it 'the oldest kurdish village' while kurds didn't exist at that time

I am slowly dying on the inside....and everyone is okay with it.,156,0.96,2023-09-30 21:13:43,"First time posting on reddit because I don't feel heard anywhere else. Believe me I have tried. I am an introvert have been dealing with social anxiety for the past three years. I've been through some traumatic experiences through my life.

I am 34 years old man. I have been there for people my whole life. Helping anyone in need. Emotionally supportive. Going above and beyond to help people who are at the lowest. I just want to see people happy and am willing to go to any lengths to make that happen. Never looking for any personal gain out of it....Just waiting for the universe to save me as I have been saving others. I have lived so many different lives and roles for others in my 34 years of existence that deep inside I do not know who I was before or who I am now. I am empty now and I feel after all this time I don't want to continue living. All that grows within me is hatred and disgust for humanitybas a whole.

I live with my cousin sister for whom I have always been there in every capacity possible. I have tried to discuss my mental health with her numerous times but she has either cut the conversation or changed the topic. Today I tried to bring it up and she shut the conversation down by saying ""You always crib and I hate it"". This broke me. 

I am disgusted by my existence. All these years of being there for others has led me down to this path of having no one to talk to or even be heard. People have no regards for anything I have done. I am forgotten. I know someone is going to bring up self worth and how I am placing it in others and seeking validation from others...but is it too much to ask. I feel I have wasted my whole life. I should have been selfish and just lived my best life and I would have been at a better place feeling more fulfilled.

"""Ugliness survey"" at the hospital exacerbated my body dysmorphia",153,0.98,2023-10-22 11:00:38,"I'm a 30 year old woman. I've struggled with body dysmorphia since childhood, mostly fixating on my nose (which has a bump and is crooked, so there is what you might call a ""real"" issue) as well as a general sort of ugliness that I cannot specifically place.   


This past summer I was hospitalized for anorexia and once I was transferred from inpatient to outpatient, they enrolled me in a few group therapies. One of the nurses in the program had me email her photos of my face from different angles and distributed these photos to ten anonymous staff members at the hospital, and asked them to answer questions like, ""How ugly is this person out of 10?"" or ""How much does this person's nose ruin their face?"" and so on. We wrote the questions together.  


Before she did this exposure I expressed multiple times that I feared I would be at risk of self-harming upon seeing the results, and that I really did not want to do it. I asked if I could opt out and she said yes but continued to bring it up and ask me why I wouldn't do it until I eventually agreed.   


The results came in and were varied. A couple people rated me a ""10"" for beauty, others a ""4."" More than half said that my nose does in fact ruin my face (ratings of 6-10 out of 10).   


These results were very distressing to me, less because of the numbers themselves and more so because I felt coerced into doing the exposure and because there was no follow up or after care. The nurse read me the results, gave me the ""raw data"" and excused me from her office. This was in July, it's mid-October now, and I am still struggling with this information.  


This is of course not the ""cause"" of my dysmorphia, but I'm feeling unable to get past what feels like confirmation of my ugliness. I have trouble leaving my apartment or working while my partner is home because I fear he will look at me and see how ugly I am. It is disrupting my every day. I am in therapy with a general counsellor and also a trauma therapist, so two sessions a week, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the BDD. I also research it and read studies and articles about the disorder to try to better understand it. I consider myself in most ways a very reasonable, giving, dedicated person, friend, and partner, but I am so totally fixated on my ugliness sometimes that I fear I will drive others away.  


I guess I am asking two things: 1. Is there any hope for dysmorphic patients? I haven't felt like I've made any progress over the 12 or so years of therapy, and 2. Is this kind of exposure experiment normal?  


Thanks very much in advance for any insight.

There are so many bad therapists,148,0.99,2023-04-25 16:04:38,"I've just been feeling really disheartened about the state of mental health lately. I work in a mental health field where part of my job is referring clients to therapy and helping coordinate their care.

Like I made them promises that this would be a helpful thing and then sent them somewhere that did more harm than good. 

I know there are great therapists (I've gone to one), but I've had personal experience with bad therapists too. It's a really harmful thing, because therapy is a very vulnerable space and is not the place where you want someone who has no idea what they're doing. And yet, there are so many providers out there that are really, truly bad at their jobs.

It's not a ""personality clash"" it's a lack of training and quality supervision.

My dad was arrested for possessing pictures of kids,146,0.95,2024-02-08 04:26:04,"This is my first post on here but I need help

My dad was arrested a few years back and was found in possession of child pornography.

(Context)

My dad was a highly respected professional in the teaching field until he was arrested and charged with possession of CP. After discussions with himself, my family and the solicitor who fought his case, I have developed some understanding of the situation. Suffering from trauma in his childhood, he had been searching through dodgy forums etc. to see how these people interacted with one another, whilst simultaneously getting extremely drunk. It was obviously a stupid thing to do and I feel like I have to believe that what he is saying is true as I do want to trust him.

I think back to my childhood, going round to friends houses, seeing their parents not drinking and thinking that was strange. This was only because of the copious amounts of alcohol he would ingest of an evening, from whiskey, to vodka, to endless cans of beer. But growing up and seeing this, day in day out, made me believe that this type of consumption was normal. 

When I initially found out what happened, I had received a phone call off my dad explaining vaguely what the situation was and as soon as I put the phone down, I couldn’t stop crying and I came to the conclusion that I wanted to end my life. I had my note written and I was ready, but in the back of my mind all I could think about was how I would never see my family again - and I ended up calling Samaritans (who were amazing might I add).

Anyway, this was 3 years ago, he was given a suspended sentence and community service, and life as a family hasn’t been the same ever since. He still lives at home with my mum but whenever I go back home, there is just a feeling of constant sadness and all of the happiness that I used to feel around my family is a relic of the past. 

I suppose the question I want to ask is, how do I move on from this? Obviously I’ll always love him unconditionally, but everyday I just feel more and more resentment towards him for the situation he put us all in - losing contact with countless friends and family members, having to prevent him from meeting any of his grandkids, all the looks and comments you get, and I could go on all day.

I don’t want to cast him out but it feels like I’m constantly grieving my dad, fuck, sometimes I think it might’ve made things easier if I was actually grieving him.

I broke up with my ex more then a year ago, during our relationship I hit her various times and I can’t remember how many times nor the details. After our breakup while talking she panicked, I asked her to leave my house and after she didn’t, I hit her and kicked her on the ground, this is the only episode I can fully remember and it terrifies me. 
Nothing similar happened during my previous relationships and I’m not a misogynist or anything of the kind, my friends respect me and when I tried to talk about this they made up excuses and told me she was lying because of her mental health issues. She went to the police and they didn’t believe her, I never said a word to deny it, and I told her I would not fight it if she had reported me, I would have told the truth.
I left the city since then and live hundreds of miles away, I’m trying to rebuild for myself a stable and decent life but this memories haunt me.

Going through a very rough time right now. I’m suffering from major anxiety and panic.

My boyfriend of 3 years has lost his patience I guess and is basically breaking up with me if I can’t provide him with enough sex. (We’re both in our 20’s looking to live together soon)

I was a victim of sexual assault/abuse as a teen and he knew this from the beginning of our relationship. We’ve always had issues with sex but some months are better and some are just kinda dry. 
He told me a week ago that he can’t sit around and wait til I get better and start controlling my sexuality anymore and I need to give him more intimacy and sex. 

I’m incredibly hurt. I’ve given him alternatives that don’t include me and I would even be open if he would satisfy his needs elsewhere. 
I really want to stay with him because I love him but my only way to save this relationship is to force myself into giving him more sex. We do it every one-two months or so. 

Is that really not enough? What am I doing wrong. My libido is extremely low and I have a lot of stress all the time. I’ve been trying to work on it for ages buying different sex toys and trying to get rid of my physical pain during sex too. 

I really thought he loved me for me and that he wouldn’t just leave me for a lack of intimacy… he’s not giving me more time unless I basically promise him I will get better and we will do it more often soon. I feel not enough. I feel unsafe and I feel let down. Will I ever be enough for him?

Little do I know it blows up. Hundreds of people reassuring me of the situation, over 40 reaching out in private messages, giving me genuine advice and the reality of the situation. It eased my mind and dried my tears. I was in a really bad place and I can thankfully say that Reddit has very possibly saved my life because it could have ended very badly.

There was also a lot of insults in those comments, a lot of people being harsh, but the good outweighed the bad and I didn’t care.

I just started feeling so much rage for this statement when it's a response to all the trauma the parents caused to a child. More like they failed at the bare minimum they were supposed to do as parents. They did their worst, not best.. And they don't even pay the consequences of the hurt they created, everyone just excuses them and it's almost wrong if the victims of them feel hate towards them..

We don't even treat children, victims of those parents, with the same respect as animals.
If you were to mistreat your dog you could go to jail and you're seen as a shit person. Nobody would say you "" did you best"". You fucking chose to take care of a dog and there should be consequences if you fail at it.. 
Can't imagine how I'm supposed to just forgive and accept parents "" doing their best""..

(25m) Heartbroken and depressed. After finding out my (27f) girlfriend cheated on me.I feel so lost and confused. She is also pregnant which makes things more complicated,125,0.98,2023-09-05 05:38:47,"
I’ve (25m) been with my girlfriend (27f) since last summer. We met at a bar and kicked it off from there. She was pretty,smart,and funny is which made me fall in love with her. I asked her to be my girlfriend in December 2022. 

She got pregnant in feb/march 2023. It was un planned and we decided to keep the baby. I also moved in with her in May. I loved her, I wanted to marry her,start a family together, and spend the rest of my life with her .

I found out a little after I moved in that she was sleeping with this guy while we were dating. We weren’t official but we both made it clear to not be sleeping or talking to other people. I caught her once in September 2022. She said she did it once but did it several times all the way to December. Also found text with her friend saying she loves this guy in February 2023. 

I was devastated when I found out and wanted to move out even though I just moved in with her. She said she was sorry and her excuse was that we weren’t official.

I don’t love her the same anymore. Im trying to make it work since she is pregnant. My mind has been all over the place.Im afraid I might have a mental break down or lose it.

My ex’s sexlife makes me sick,123,0.78,2023-08-14 18:20:06,"I was in a relationship with my ex for 1 1/2 years, at the beginning of the relationship she told me about her sexual experiences which were 2. The one was a cop with an extreme superiority complex. He wasn’t asking her for permission slapped her hard, had sex too hard. She didn’t know what she was doing and just let it happen. 
Our sex life had problems because of her past experience, but after a while she enjoyed it a lot. You could say I opened her the wonders of the sex world. But during our relationship, the thought of that cop experience always stuck with me an made me sick. I get very frustrated and angry when I think about it and start too feel like I need to throw up.
Now that our relationship is over for about 3 months, i get even more sick by the thought of it.
I’m scared that she will go back for him just to have sex. I just hope it doesn’t happen.
Is this feeling I’m getting normal? Should I visit a therapist about it?

Thanks in advance!

I’m in a really dark place after the breakup and thought I can post here something, because I have no one to talk too.
My only real friend was my ex :(


Edit:
Thanks for all the support, but I owe some of you an more detailed explanation of the phrase “wonders of the sex life”. Yes I see it seems sketchy to say that. What I meant, was that she never experienced a partner who cared for her well being while having sex. Like taking it slow and listing to her body. She never had orgasms in the instances before or a sense of pleasure. 
And for all the people saying that she had different kinks and all that stuff. Later on we had our spicy adventures.

I still grieve, yes, but I sensed that everything gets Easier on me

This world has no magic and it's unacceptable.,125,0.93,2024-03-19 14:24:54,"When I was young I found the cheap looking, plastic tiara and rod which advertised as it is for 'enchanted fairy, at discount store, and naive thought was going on. One day I read a novel about a family that can bring the force to shield evil magicians, hidden in remote place of mountainside. I was very into said book with scripture so I actually tried the babbles in the room for over hour while holding my breath, drew my whole force and willpower to do the 'chant and fantastically resulted nothing. Later I got the said fancy rod at mall and read the instruction, was so happy to summon a small friend with it But I realized there's no battery at home. And quickly realized that I have no money at pocket. Even worse it doesn't seem to make me a cute magic familiar.

""How this world is livable without magic..?

""So this was lie, ok but how about that one?

My brain was looking for other option after this big disappointment, and this kind of disappoints, drowned me into deep sadness. It was just lie. The world is lying to me.

As writing this post as adult, still I think it's better to disappear from this world and reborn in fairyland instead. This way of start is just terrible and destined to cause mental illness, all isn't enchanted and I can't do no magic. This cold fact is absolutely drowning me in tear, no life can be reverted from death and I'm hopeless after that, while I'm slowly dying inside of short lived cage, ultimately lose all those cryptic memoires.

"I'm 16 and my life is already falling apart, all because of me. I'm too weak for this world.",123,0.94,2023-12-12 08:07:38,"I (16F) am complete scum. At this point, the only reason society wouldn't discard me is my age and perhaps gender. I imagine that if an older male shared my lifestyle and beliefs, he'd immediately be regarded as a loser/bottom of the barrel. You know what I'm talking about. The guy who lives in his mom's basement, unemployed and loveless.

I'm self-centered and selfish, hateful towards myself, yet not enough to change anything. I have no drive or self-discipline to do anything, I go along with whatever can make me forget my reality. My escapism techniques include, but not limited to: binge eating, maladaptive daydreaming, compulsive masturbation, using character AI, obsessing over media (hyperfixations, as I'm autistic too). I spend my days bedrotting.

I'm extremely paranoid, to the point of delusions, at least according to others. I fear that my family is spying on me/my devices. Which is a major source of constant anxiety, considering the kind of stuff I do. The only friend I had is just like me, with the exception that he was capable enough to get himself out of the hole I'm in. Secretly, I began hating him for it due to my jealousy. Our friendship was just him dragging me around while I complain. I'm glad he stopped contacting me - it's less humiliating that way.

And by reading this, you might get the impression I'm someone who had a difficult life. Not really. I used to be one of those 'gifted kids' that learned to read faster than everyone else, got praised, etc, etc. I was used to having everything handed to me on a silver platter, giving up immediately if things didn't go my way. I'm not self-sufficient, I learned how to do my laundry last week.

Every once in a while, I'll make an empty promise to improve. My addictions are a glaring issue but whenever I try to stop, I get reminded of how miserable I really am. I face reality and I can't handle it. I feel furious, anxious,  to the point of having panic attacks. Which leads me back into my vices again. It goes like this - 1. Spend a week bedrotting and indulging in my addictions.

2. What the fuck am I doing with myself? I could be doing something productive.

3. Make the smallest attempt at being present in my life, at fixing something, at existing.

4. ""Everyone's better than you, you're stupid, undisciplined, ungrateful, incapable, friendless, ugly, fat, etc. Why even try?""

5. \*cue breakdown\*

6. Rinse and repeat

I have a classmate who often tries to reach out to me, which I don't understand. She's hardworking, friendly, ambitious, an overall bright person. The complete opposite of me. I politely turn her down, because she doesn't know what she's messing with. I don't want to drag her down.

Only reason I get up in the morning are my dopamine hits. Nothing else.

Because isn't being in your twenties about partying, having fun, banging chicks, etc ?? I obviously figured out that's a myth, and it's only shown in movies. That's one of the reasons why I don't watch any movies or shows in a romantic genre, even in horror movies whenever they have a sex scene I immediately skip it. 

But although, I'm an average looking guy (not like a super model) but I still somehow can't get with anyone my age. I missed out on love and dating throughout my teen years all because I suffered from autism.

"My sister found out the hard way, that our mom is unreachable.",119,0.98,2023-06-16 04:51:51,"So my mom is a textbook narcissist- always the victim always everyone else’s fault she’s never to blame- she’s an angel. She also has this weird trait where the longer time goes by the more and more she manipulates reality in her mind- 1 documented example was when my sister told her she didn’t want to follow my moms path and get a masters in psychology because “It’s stupid and a waste? what have you done with your degree?” - which was/is true mom has a masters in psychology from a major university. So instead of just scolding my sister she parked in the store
parking lot across from her school- locked the doors and proceeded to beat the living shit out of her raking her forearms punching her face ripping chunks of her hair out…..all while her friend is in the back seat screaming…. she did so much damage in less than 2-3 mins the friend said- and then my mom just drove the 20-30secs to the school and dropped off my sister- told her go to class before you’re late- so of course an 11yr old walking into a school blood dripping from her arms patches of hair missing a swollen face drew some attention-Cps was called and we had bi weekly home visits
for 6 months-when my dad got home he was like”WTF vickie what did you do, my
god look what you did to our daughter” and my mom defiantly said “that little brat deserved it she was being disrespectful, and then proceeded to tell us how rude and disrespectful my sister was and how she deserved it” no empathy or apology-
then 6months later it morphed into self protection and minimizing what actually happened- 2 years later it morphed into something completely unrecognizable of the truth “Your sister was trying to yank the steering wheel into oncoming traffic i had to defend myself while fighting her off “

That’s just one story of the woman i’m talking about-So i’ve known for over a decade that anything coming out of her mouth is either a lie or a manipulation 99.9% not the truth or what actually happened.So for the life of me i don’t know why my sister believes the bullshit that comes out of her mouth sometimes. My sister is in vacation in our mother country and calls me telling me mom told
her a story about how dad would hit me and hit her-10000% false that man never laid a finger on any of us-the only thing he could be faulted with was not believing us and not divorcing her faster.He is the definition of a great loving father- everything she’s not. I fucked up and let the beans spill about how not only
did dad never hit us but mom sexually abused me -i’d wake up in the middle
of the night with her rubbing my feet the rubbing my thighs and i blanked out the rest- she would walk in on me showering -
pull the curtain open and then tell me
how the size of my peen compared to my dads…..about how the time mom made me file a false police report against our father saying he hit her or else i wouldn’t get to escape from her and spend a 4 day weekend at my friends(my dad was in oil&gas industry- being a 14yr old kid getting hit for flinching around her - i took every opportunity i could to escape from her- so i went along with her filed a false
police report and my mom almost got my dad fired from his prestigious job- the real reason was $- my dad had limited her access to their $ and she was pissed about it - wanted to get back at him. So i fucked up spilled the beans to my sister and now she’s so angry she wants to make my mom go to the police and file reports whenever she gets back from vacation- my sister now has a
degree of control over my mom
because she gives her 500$/month and pays her 12k/year property taxes. So i get a call from my mom crying and saying she’ll apologize for whatever she just can’t go to the police and go to jail- while part of me wants that, a friend who used to be a therapist told me “It’s like
you’re both living in the past with her” and i believe him- so putting aside the lies the bearings the S/a, i told my sister i feel it would be better if we just sought out professional help to work through this 20yr old trauma and just cut off contact with our mom, next time we see her should be at her funeral.
You can’t reason with a person like her who never sees herself as the aggressor as the demon as evil incarnate.
When i bring up this fact to my mom “How come 4/5 of us plus my sisters friends plus my friends-how come all these people remember reality one way and you’re the only one that remembers things the way you do? how come that’s the case? and she replied with” $ and your father’s brainwashing “ i laughed hung up and blocked her and told my sister i won’t be accompanying her to the police station- i want to seek therapy and move on with my life. My sister has ptsd and her brain just doesn’t remember a lot of these events me my dad and my other brother are cursed with remembering everything. There’s soooo much more i could put on about her- like specific scenarios where reality=A, and Her reality =ansisiehduehdwjsbsxhehwkdbdush

How can I help my suicidal wife who tried to OD yesterday and STILL won't go to the hospital? I'm at wits end and I'm exhausted,116,0.95,2023-06-17 10:45:19,"Update 2-
They are discharging her. Wtf is she that good at hiding shit or is psych at the hospital stupid. Shes texting me so she's been cleared by psych. She keeps saying I love you, and I just want to scream. Think a thick foam pillow would middle scream? 

the system fails again.  So tired of this I can't take care her mental needs. I just want to shut down I'm so stressed I'm hallucinating vividly. reality is weird. 

I still haven't slept probably won't till way later. 

Why do I even try to get her help when the medical system just doesn't care. 

The stray who I fed and let sleep on the porch came by severely injured. I will spare y'all the details. We have no money nor car for a vet.mil said to call animal control. He is an elderly at least 12 years old feral stray with no teeth. I highly doubt they will spend a dime to save him.

 It like when it rains it pours. That cat let me and only me pet him even though hes been here longer then me. We had a bond. He came home looking for help. I'm glad I was there to help him, he got right into the carrier I put outside to trap him so he didn't wander off. 

  I'm overwhelmed

Update 1- texted the 988 line someone commented. They walked em through calling 911 stayed on the line with me.  My wife is beyond pissed off at me
 She yelled at the emts for not wearing masks in our house.  But she ended up going because the emts told her it wasn't optional the amount she took was considered a suicide attempt. She didn't even look at me as she left.

I know I did the right thing. I should have done it sooner.

_____

OP

She tried to OD today she's only not in the hospital cause she threatened to leave me if I caused her to be in the psych ward again. But she took TWO huge according to her handfuls of her old lithium that for some reason didn't get thrown out. She says she did throw up about 20 minutes after taking them. So no idea how much actually got into her system.

I sat with her all day in her room and now we both have our bedroom doors open so we can hear each other and easily check on each other ,(our rooms are right next to each other we literally talk by simply talking loud) 

She won't go to the hospital I keep begging her. She has been dangerously suicidal for a year EVERY day she tells me in tears she wants to die. 
She says she will make an appt with a psychiatrist on Monday but she rarely ever keeps her psych appointments she always makes excuses even if it's a telehealth visit. Even if she does and they prescribe meds she won't take them. She will for a week and then stop saying they make her feel weird. I try explaining that that is normal and will go away but she would rather stop the meds entirely.

How can I help her get the help she needs? She says she isn't suicidal right now,but that's besides the pint she took a ton of lithium she needs to be monitored.
I'd prefer she go in the morning to the ER and from there the psych ward for medication management. She says she will take the meds if we go through scheduling on Monday but even so it could take months for her to get in to see someone psychiatrists are heavily booked in our area.

I'm scared I'm going to wake up and find her dead.

My friend died and I can't stop playing Valorant,114,0.97,2024-04-01 19:29:32,"I (23F) lost a close friend of mine (22F) last Wednesday. It was out of nowhere. We were supposed to hang out that night with our group of friends, but we didn't get to do that. And surely, it makes no sense to me and it never will.  
  
Since I first got the news, sleeping and eating are hard for me. Coincidentally, she passed away on Holy Week (religious holiday here in Latin America, from Thursday to Sunday) so after the memorial, I couldn't stop playing for 10 hours straight. I had to force myself to sleep to stop playing. I'm lucky enough to have found two people on queue which I started playing with and they made me feel better about this situation.  
  
Since today (Monday after Holy Week) isn't a holiday anymore, I had to start working and studying again. It's extremely hard to go back to the 9-5 routine. I had so many activities before this whole thing and I feel like I can't do them. I can just play Valorant to stop thinking about it but of course, it's unhealthy for me. Whenever I'm not playing, I'm thinking of my friend and my heart sinks. So I choose to play to have a little bit of fun and forget about it for a second.  
  
I'm thinking about therapy, since I'm not used to talking about my feelings nor am I good expressing myself. I know right now Valorant is a coping mechanism of mine and I need to give myself time because it's all very recent. I just don't want to get addicted to it in order to neglect my feelings. I feel like if I uninstall or stop playing I won't get even a tiny temporary peace of mind, so any advice, recommendation, would be very helpful.

One Bad Trip Changed My Life,114,0.93,2024-02-10 16:32:39,"On October 1st 2013, I smoked some weed. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was laced with an unknown substance. I had a horrific experience. I may have been on the roof at one point. I was all alone, and I live in the middle of the woods, so no one knows what all actually happened. 

Well, a few weeks later, I ended up in the hospital for it. I acted deranged enough that they put me in the quiet room. I was only in the hospital for about a week or two, but I was forever fucked up by that experience. When they let me out, I had to stay with my grandparents because I couldn’t handle being at home for various reasons regarding details of the bad trip. 

During that time, I lost control of myself, and I very violently murdered a few of my family members, and I got put back in the hospital and back in the quiet room by myself.

Now, that last part never happened, but you can imagine how fucked up I was that I believed that I did that. And it still haunts me as if it actually happened because it felt so real. I can still feel my cousin’s little neck in my hands and the cracking it made when I killed him, even though it never happened. I can still see the horror on everyone’s faces as they tried to pin me down. I can still feel my back against the carpet as they held me and cried.

It took about a year, but I got a hold of myself, and I slowly started to be able to differentiate between my vivid imagination and reality again, and I haven’t had trouble with it since.

I despise men and lose sleep after multiple violent incidents caused by them,111,0.78,2024-01-02 14:38:55,"I am 22F. The hatred and anger I feel about men now isn't healthy and I can't stop feeling this way. I watched my boyfriend be attacked from behind while he was in the bathroom and he was nearly blinded/killed. I had to throw myself between them as he had passed out. I was taking punches trying to keep his head protected because he had passed out while the men behind the bar and owner (who didnt hire a bouncer) just watched and shouted and didn't step in. It only stopped after he ran away and I was screaming for help. No one called the police or ambulance I had to call his dad to pick us up  After that incident I havent been able to sleep I got put on 5 pills by my psychiatrist to deal with the trauma and flashbacks. I have never went to a party/club and that was our 4th time out. Yesterday at new years the second time we have went out since the incident a man threatened me for moving a jacket, which I moved so I could sit down (it wasn't his, it wasn't mine, the guy who's jacket it was is up dancing he doesn't even know the guy) I wasn't about to sit on someone's jacket so shifted it up a bit so I could sit with my group. It was moved 5 inches and he had 2 seats of space ). I could feel my anxiety creep up after the threat and my boyfriend told him to calm down, there is no issue here and this man slid up behind me (he was 2 metres away) and started threatening my boyfriend telling him to meet him outside. My boyfriend rolled his eyes ignored him and just put his arm around me and kept talking to the group. At this point I was having flashbacks, I started having a bad panic attack, I couldn't breath, tears were streaming, I was gasping for breath. Boyfriend and his cousin noticed and got me outside so I could breathe where the bouncer came up to say he could understand where he was coming from since he was there first (I still have no clue how me not wanting to sit on a strangers jacket and moving it beside me so I wasn't on top of it is worthy of his behaviour) At this point I was just saying between gasps 'i dont actually care about that I'm just having ptsd I don't need this right now'    bouncer walked away and I was being calmed down between panic attacks. I woke up this morning with intense anger. I can't let it go. IV had enough of grown men not being able to control themselves and being violent over something a simple as a jacket that wasn't even his or someone he knows. I'm going to my psychiatrist soon because I can't keep living like this. I have had an abusive father who abused us and my brother has physically attacked me leaving me with bruises and a bloody nose over wanting to watch football in the living room. It's going to be a while before I get an appointment and I'm just not wanting to go outside for fear of something happening. It's consuming my every thought and I start shaking in anger over my disgust with men.

I've never wanted to smack the obnoxious, defiant, vindictive, disrespect out of anyone the way I want to with her. 

ESPECIALLY when she uses her sweet, innocent 4yo sister as her main scapegoat...

(The behaviors started five years before she had a sibling so it may inflame it, but it is certainly not the cause.)

I am in a perpetual state of anger, defensiveness, sadness, resentment, shame, self-loathing, and dread. 

I can't keep existing this way...

__________________________________________
**EDITED TO ADD CONTEXT**

My daughter is 13yo.  She has been struggling with ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder), ADHD, and HFA since she we put the pieces together when she was about 3.5yo.

The main issue is her ODD.  If you're not familiar with ODD first-hand, it's really hard to understand the full scope.  She has 3-7 SCREAMING tantrums throughout the course of any normal day.  These typically last a minimum of 20 minutes to upwards of 90 minutes.  Not a single syllable of that is exaggerated.  They will start over simple things like me asking her if she washed her hands before making lunch, her refusing to figure out how to solve simple problems (ex: there's clothes in the dryer and she needs to switch her clothes over), or getting caught in a lie (ex: I can see from the security camera that she did X and she will scream and get violent trying to lie about it).  Before we started homeschooling, we were getting phone calls to pick her up at least 2, if not 3, times per week because she was being violent with the teachers and disruptive of the learning environment.  

These are all very literal, real examples. These literally happen every day... since she was 3yo.

We have done ALL the things... psychiatrist, in-home therapist, special needs program at school, different pediatricians, school social workers, read the books, tried the tactics.  We have heard from no less than a dozen professionals ""wow, you're doing all of the things we typically suggest"" -- but nothing works!  (And I'm Sicilian, so discipline is not lost on me.)

You can imagine the toll this takes on our family life when so much time and effort is put into ending her tantrums so we can do things and go places, including canceling vacations, not attending family events, etc.  For the past 1.5yrs, she's started to get really jealous of her little sister (who is currently 4yo) and she is now her scapegoat.  The added stress of having to protect my innocent, sweet little girl from someone she worships is too much.

The resentment comes from how much emotional energy, time, and money we've put into trying to help her over the past decade+ since we isolated the diagnoses with NO return or no change and, if anything, escalating behaviors as the teen 'tude sets in.  It's like living in an emotional warzone and I would be struggling even if I weren't also BPD and struggling on my own.

My mom claims she has thousands of bugs crawling on her,103,0.99,2024-02-07 20:00:11,"I don’t know what to do anymore. My mom 54 years old has been convinced for the last 3 months that she has scabies, or mite infestations. I want to let it known that just over a year ago she was in the hospital for three weeks due to a nervous breakdown. She was having “shakes” and “shocks”, the doctors could never figure out was wrong. 

Life was okay for a couple of months after she got better she was off work for 8 months. She went back to work 4 months ago when all of this started. She started telling our house that the animals had fleas, which then turned into mites. She bought medication for all our animals and claimed the were more free.( even with no evidence whatsoever they even had them to begin with)

About a month later she started telling us that she thinks there’s mites on the furniture. She cleaned the whole house, along with all the furniture and starting making homemade sprays to kill the “mites”. 

About a week later she told my dad that she has scabies. She said she found a rash on herself and that she knows it scabies. Instead of going to our family doctor she called a over the phone clinic where she spoke to someone over the phone who said they recommended scabies cream. She then proceeded to buy said cream and use it. She bought it again and used it again. She now uses scabies cream every week. She has these hives in her body, she’s been putting lotion all over her body along with tea tree oil and homemade mixers as well. She also took all the furniture out of her bedroom, along with clothes and anything really. She then took all the couches out of the living room. Claiming they were infested. 

She refuses to go see a dermatologist, or have an ink test done or a scratch test for mites. She has 4 showers a day boiling hot, along with doing her bedding two times a day. Every time she naps she washes them. She has spent about 3 thousand dollars on mattress covers and new clothes. For the first couple of weeks my dad was supportive and helping her. We all put in this cream to help ease her mind. There’s 4 people living in our house. 

Fast forward 2 months and my mother is very un hinged. I’m feeling extremely uncomfortable living with her. She’s constantly picking at her skin and picking at her bed claiming any little piece of dirt she mites is a mite. She’s even been in my room along with my nans looking at our beds for “ evidence “.

I’m currently looking for a place of my own since I simply can’t handle her anymore. I don’t know what to do and neither does my dad. He’s been supporting her, and trying to understand. But now I feel like someone needs to do something. I’ve heard of Delusional parasitosis, and so far everything I’ve been reading sounds just like what’s been happening to her. 

Today I caught her picking at her skin along with putting a whole bottle of tea tree oil in her hair. She has hives on her neck, as she keeps scratching and picking. She pops the bites on her head claiming she can feel thousands of babies all over her whenever she does this. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. As I fear I’m getting more and more worried about her mental health, she’s starting to scare me. I want to be there and support her but I also don’t want to be an enabler. 

It’s hard to talk to my dad about this, as he claims that we should just let her medicate and use the lotion and hopefully they will go away if she will relax. He’s not really helping the situation. It’s also important to note that my mom does use marijuana, and it’s on anxiety and depression, medication, as well as sleep medication. 

I need help on what to do. 

Any suggestions would be helpful.

I was sexually abused when I was 10 by my mother's younger brother and my parents didn't do anything about it. ,104,0.99,2024-03-25 13:55:20,"I was 10 and I visited his house with my mother that winter. We were in their bedroom and having dinner on the floor (his wife, my mom and me). He was on the bed, under a blanket, watching TV. All of a sudden, he calls me to get under the blanket. I didn't want to go but my mom pushed me to go. Then my mom and aunt left the room to do the dishes downstairs. He switched the channel to a religious one where holy songs were being played. Then he proceeded to molest me. He hugged me tightly, tried to kiss my lips, then ran his hands all over my body. I could feel his penis against me. Then he slided in his hands under my clothes and rubbed my private parts. I don't know why I couldn't leave the moment he started touching me inappropriately. I just laid there like a corpse. The trance broke when I heard my cousin come back downstairs. I told him that I needed to go and left. I couldn't speak about this to anybody for the fear of broken relationships. I had to share the house with that monster for the next couple of days. I started developing severe anxiety right after that incident and still hasn't gone away. Although I never spoke to him after that incident, I had to be in the same vicinity because of our familial ties. And it was deeply uncomfortable but I kept shut. 
After 12 years of this, I revealed it to my mother in a fit of rage and she blamed me for not revealing it to her earlier. Her stance was clear that she couldn't do anything about it because it was too late, and it's difficult to pick between your child and your sibling. I was shocked beyond anything by this. When I shared this with my dad after a while, he assured me plainly on the surface and moved on. He continues to share a good relationship with that man, so does my mother. But anytime I bring this up, they try their best to make it seem like it's not a big deal and I should move on because it has been too long. Who is going to make them understand that I haven't been able to process this incident and it ruined what was left of my childhood. I fully understand that my parents' validation to something doesn't define my life. But it's difficult when you live in a brown household. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety since then. There's no way to reverse my suffering. 
I am beyond disgusted and pained to write everything in such excruciating details but I have never shared the deetz with anyone in the past 13 years. I don't expect anything out of this.

I got fired for my mental health today,104,0.94,2023-06-08 22:18:10,"So I got fired today, they’re reasoning was that I had “To many emotional outbursts and was distracting to the trainer and the other class members”. 

Some context, I was in a 9 week training period for a job. I was doing all the work and was one of the top members in my training group when it came to attendance, performance and scores. This class did not come without it’s bumps, we started out with 18 and by week three had 11 due to one particular student who could not grasp the concept of the job we where training for. And when she was told she was wrong she would get verbal and at on point physical. And then we went down too 8 as some drama happened between certain class members and one quit while one got fired. 

Now onto me, these class rooms where small and the noise would echo. I get overstimulated as I have extreme anxiety and depression which I’m medicated for but recently the medications haven’t been working. I just got insurance so I was planning on seeing a therapist but until then I was pushing on like a normal human. I had a few times where the overstimulation made me cry so I removed myself for a couple of minutes with the teachers permission and then I would return. I had a panic attack one day as one of the class mates got mad and yelled in my face triggering a episode. But again I removed myself from the room, spoke with the teacher who said I was fine and returned to class. Everyones performance stayed the same and the duties we where doing did not get affected.

30 minutes and happy birthday to me! 🎂,102,0.99,2023-05-04 03:30:14,"I didn’t think I’d be around for this long, I made a promise to my friend when I was healing and becoming clean and that helped wonders- 4 years ago and now I’m slowly learning to establish boundaries. I’m learning more about myself than I’ve ever before. My parents tell me I’ve wasted time, useless, can’t be helped and why I passed off so much. But looking back from the progress of where I came from to now, I’ve grown tremendously and beautifully- I’ve changed as a person for the better and I’m not in a self destructive state with a better mental health, attempted eating habits, and knowing my limits and self care despite maybe needing asd diagnosis test and an adhd one. 

I now know not to put myself through self sacrifice to help others due to parental trauma and I’ve learned not to beg for love that’ll never return to me from my parents but that’s still a work in process. I’ll eventually seek therapy again for my health but for the time being, I am proud to say- I’m turning into an adult soon. I had matured too early due to absent parenting but that will heal someday. That concludes everything, my promise to not self destruct to my friend ends tonight but I’ll always keep that promise to my heart for the rest of my life.

Is it possible that you get dumber after being in a long period of acute depression/bad mental state?,101,1.0,2023-09-05 12:58:04,"(I apologize for the wording of the question and the choice of words that I made in the post)

I went through a period where I was at an all times low in my life in every way imaginable. For 2 years straight I suffered so badly from depression that I had to quit my job, and university, I shunned all my friends and fought constantly with my family, and my physical health declined so badly that I am battling level 1 hypertension and have gone half bald at 24. It led me to attempt to end my life 4 times and I had (what I assume to be) multiple episodes of psychosis. I am now in a relatively better place (I am back in university and am becoming social slowly). The problem is, I can't do any of the things I used to do.

I used to be great with art, I drew, painted, wrote in my spare time, and even worked as a fashion designer. Now I can't draw a straight line to save my life. I also used to love to go on hikes, ride my bike, and go swimming. I can't do any of it, despite being trained and playing in my school's swimming team from when I was 8 until I was 16.

One of my friends has a history of battling depression and anxiety (and have attempted multiple time in the past). She also lost some function until she started going to a psychiatrist and therapist. I didn't have professional help and tried therapy for months but it didn't do much.

With that being said, what's your experience with regression after depression? Do you think people get ""dumber"" or lose mental/motor functions after being in a long period of depression?

And I think that’s why people romanticize trauma so much. 

But what the movies don’t tell you is that sometimes, you get raped and afterwards you cry and cry cry cry cry in the bathroom and scrub yourself clean. And you go to sleep and then you go to class in the morning like nothing happened.

Yeah my wife wants to leave me,97,0.98,2023-04-21 08:11:57,"I found a letter she wrote that she intended to give to me tomorrow. I was by myself, alone and my house. My wife had left for something I wasn’t invited to and I happened across the letter. 

Basically the whole thing boils down to she thinks I’m unhappy in our marriage, she says she’s unhappy with our marriage and wants to begin the process for divorce.

This shattered me to a million pieces.lately I’ve been dealing with more stress and anxiety than I ever have and finding that letter broke me.

I told her I found the letter and I had left one of my own explaining the mental health issues I’ve been dealing with, apologizing for her being drawn into it and for all the times I tried to cope in an unhealthy way.

my wife is going to tell me she wants a divorce. I do not want a divorce.

Tomorrow is going to be an extremely difficult day for me  (or today at this point by now)

I’ve seen the writing on the wall, I haven’t been the husband she deserves for a multitude of reasons but, she’s been the wife I’ve needed to keep me under control.

I don’t want to lose my wife. I wrote a letter for her explaining in excruciating detail that I’ve been dealing with mental health issues that have otherwise left me failing as a proper husband and consistently letting her down and breaking promises (not in spite of her) 

I know what’s coming and I dread it more than anything I ever have before. Tomorrow is judgement day it would seem and I’m worried about how I’m going to manage without her should she ultimately decide to leave.

I have no intention of forcing her to stay in a marriage she is unhappy in, I just feel like we’ve never really tried to make things work and I want to at the very least try.

We’re going to talk tomorrow about how we are going to proceed and I really just need some support.

I don’t know what her absolute decision will be but based on what I read, she has been done with this marriage for long time

I still love her, she is the only reason I have a degree and a job related to the degree I obtained.

This past March was our 5th year wedding anniversary, I did not anticipate that it could be our last. 

I’ve been stuck in a dark place for the past few weeks and I don’t want to lose my wife.

She seems to think we’ve been living a loveless marriage, which I will accept blame for not fulfilling my end of the intimacy aspect of the relationship. I don’t meant to imply this is entirely my fault however I do accept that in my imperfect actions as a husband also contributed to this situation.

My wife seems to think I don’t love her. I do, more than I could ever explain.

I travel frequently for work and I feel like this has not only contributed to the strife in my marriage but also driven me to the brink of insanity.

I took the job because it was the best offer after I a graduated and I thought it would be in both of our interests for me to take it as it was a significant pay increase compared to what I was making. (I did not make this decision without her)

I think this job has contributed to the downfall of the relationship between my wife and myself.

These next few days are going to be very hard for me, I feel like I’ve matured 10 years over the span of a week, the stress and anxiety have been unbearable. 

I don’t want to lose my wife, she is the light in my life but, I’m not going to try to force her to stay in a marriage that she does not think she can be happy in.

It’s rough, guys and I am not looking forward to our conversation but, I need to find closure one way or the other or I’m going to lose my mind.



***********************UPDATE************************

I have just reopened Reddit since posting this. There are a lot of comments and I will get around to answering those of you I am able to as I am able to.

Just as a little general answer as to how things are at the moment: 

I’ve found peace in this situation and have been preparing myself for whatever the final outcome of my marriage is.

I’ve been staying with my parents for a week, I’ve been getting counseling, I was started in an antidepressant and right now I’m going through the wonderful effects that starting an antidepressant brings.

My wife and I are separating for a year, she is taking our dog and will be living in Iowa with her grandmother for the next year until she has to return for school.

I feel like I’m starting to come out of a lifetime of being on autopilot and feel hope for my future for the first time in years.

I was sexually abused as a boy,94,0.97,2023-11-09 02:09:01,"Well, that's the first time I talk about it at all. I'm 20 now and I suffered abuse since I cannot remember until I was 11. It took a long time to realize what happened to me was wrong and a longer time to realize I was not the wrong side. Until this, how I say, my mind was a straight up hell.

&#x200B;

I was a shy and isolated child. I actually talked a lot with my close ones, but introvert at all, nothing wrong. I remember when I was around 5, my grandmother told me to lie down with her in the bed. I refused at first, but she insisted so much that I accepted. She then started to talk about things involving sexual organs and how it was important to me to know the female body(remembering, I was 5). She asked me if I had ever seen a woman naked, so I told something like ""I've taken showers with my cousin(my age, call her 'Ana')"". Then she literally pulled down her pants and asked me to touch it, to ""know how it is"". I remember feeling very embarrassed and uncomfortable, and she said something like ""you have not to feel any wrong with this, it's like your cousin, but bigger"". Fucked up.

&#x200B;

Later, when I was 7-8, I was pretty often in her house, since my parents worked the whole day. So I often ate, took showers and slept there. Just to say, Some nights I couldn't sleep because that bedroom made me terrified(I actually didn't know why at this time). My younger brother and cousin(male) also were often there. At this age, she put us together in bath and, honestly, nothing inappropriated ever happened during these times. For some reason, the disturbing things happened only when we were alone, and she developed some creepy obsession with me, I will explain later.

&#x200B;

She had one of those electric massage tools, you know. She liked to massage my body with that, and I liked it in the beggining. She massaged my shouders, arms and feet, and that felt really good. But with time, she started to spend more and more time putting that thing over my chest and legs, until she put it over my genitals. I think that was my first orgasm, because the feeling was so intense and unexpected(also my body was probably aroused by the preliminary contact, but I couldn't know what is was). I had never experienced an erection at this time, but even so my genitals were ""wet"" when I went to bathroom. She made it more times, but not so intense, she kinda passed the tool around my legs and stomach and sometimes put it over the genitals, for a little time. She always told me I was her favourite grandchild, the most handsome, and other kinds of praises that made me feel disgusting.

&#x200B;

Sadly, the signs of abuse started to appear at that time. I became more introvert in school and, sometimes, I really froze when talking to people, and couldn't make many friends. I became aroused too. I felt I had the need of masturbate, not periodically because it felt good, but almost every day led by pure anxiety and that felling that it's the only way you were taught to do. fortunately, I never extended this to other people, but always kept it to myself(actually it fucked my mental health, but I honestly prefer this than become an abuser and victimizing and hurt other people). I remember taking baths with my cousin(yeah, that one I told in the bed) at my 9-10 and I never made any sexual play or talk with her. I only had a bit of curiosity about her vagina(also she about my penis), but those thoughts faded away when we started playing of throwing water at each other and make silly beards with foam. Those are actually good memories, which is kinda ironical in my opinion.

&#x200B;

So I hit puberty. I was 11 and, for privacy reasons, I told her I didn't want to take my baths with cousins or brothers. Anyways, she was until in the bedroom(there were a bedroom and bathroom, no door between them) and it was not a problem at all, I've taken many baths with she watching before. One day, After I finished the bath, I got up to shower the foam off and asked her for the towel. I always made this, but that time, well, I had an erection. Not first time, but first in front of someone. Well, she basically touched me very inapropriately, not going to give details here.

&#x200B;

I took baths there only a few times more, until I stopped totally to go there and stayed alone in home. In these days before I took this decision, her obsession about me and my body became sick. when I was in the bathroom, she started to massage my body and making awful comments about my penis. Yeah, some sick things like ""how can something be so thick, do you do exercises for it to grow?"", ""the girls will be crazy when you put this in front of them"" and ""your girlfriend will be a very happy girl with this"". Sorry for the girls reading this. Uh, my parts are actually very normal, and it's not a problem to me. I really care way more about feelings and caring than the body, and I'm pretty sure I could only stay with a girl if she felt the same. But now I know that she was doing had never to do with caring or increasing my self steem, but some distrubing way to catch me psychologically.

&#x200B;

Still in this bath part, she touched me very times, in the whole body. One day she took my phone that I had left in my pants and started reading my personal messages. There was really nothing I should be worried about, but it made me very uncomfortable too. Another day, after I took my clothes off, she said me to wait because she wanted to take a bath first. So she undressed in front of me and I obviously had an erection. She didn't touch me but I could see by her face that she was very satisfied producing that. That day was the more disturbing. After she finished, she told me to get in(She got out and dressed first, fortunately) and take my turn. I did, and when I get out, she told me to lie down in the bed, because she had noticed I had ""a rash on my inner thighs"" and she needed to see it. I honestly cannot describe what I was feeling. A mix of anxiety, fear, and somehow, arousal. When she pulled my towel off, I had a full erection. She put an oinment in my thighs and then started with that twisted comments about my body, penis and girls. So she put an oil in her hands and started, you know what. It may feel disturbing, but she moved her hands so passionately over my testicles and penis that it really looked like she was pleasing herself. I knew I should stop that, I should run away and tell someone, but at that time I felt so, uh, horny maybe, that I just couldn't stop it. I feel it extremely disgusting, but I think whoever experienced an orgasm knows exactly what I'm talking about. Well, then I came in her hands and that was the last time I went there.

&#x200B;

The last part was the worst of all, no doubts. I was in later middle school and I had always got the best grades in every subject, but my grades ""suddenly"" decreased to hell. To worsen the situation, my math teacher was very harsh and blamed me everytime for getting bad grades. I stopped doing things I liked before and lost 30kg (66 pound) in a very short time. I got also kind of addicted to porn, since it was the only thing that could distract me even for a few minutes. The rest of the time was pure torment in my head. I also had nocturnal panic and some weird things like imagining that there were demons or monsters in my bedroom. My family is evangelical, and it didn't help me much. Everytime I went to the church, I could feel anything but shame and guilt, feeling as I was not worth of being there. And, since I had not friends or someone I could trust to open myself, I always ended up believing those thoughs were true.

&#x200B;

When I was to get into middle school, I moved to other school. It's not necessary to say that my mind was not healthy and I couldn't make lasting relationship bonds. I was getting good grades again, but no one of my friends of that time remains close to me today, except by that cousin, Ana, who studied with me in high school. We had a good friendship, and our talks are almost always about music, school and politics. Since we are relatives and were very close in childhood, she felt ok to talk about sex with me sometimes, but always in a respectful way. Her concerns were most about having sex before marriage, and I said her if she wanted to be with her boyfriend for life and both felt ok with that, it shouldn't there be any problem(she's with the same guy until today and they are happy, I feel really glad for her). Today she's in 2nd year to become a psychologist. Sometimes I think about talking these things with her, but I really don't feel secure to open up.

&#x200B;

In my last year in middle school, I got really depressed. I lost my will to live and have a future, I didn't got into college and abandoned all my social circle. The only thing I did in this time was work, go to church and sleep. Despite my shame feelings never left, I always prayed to God to help me, at least, don't give up on everything. I think I'm doing well actually. 

&#x200B;

In my 19, I took my drive license. I thought I wouldn't be able to do it, due to my high anxiety level and a almost constant headache I have, but I did and I drive pretty well. I am also going to do exams to get into a college the next week. I'm not full confident that I will pass but I promised to not desperate and try again next year if I fail. I also found a girl that became one of the most important parts of my life. We are not in love yet, but I can feel she likes me the same way I like her. She laughs at all my jokes and pay attention when I'm talking, and it really makes a great difference. I don't struggle with thoughts like ""if I had found someone like her before I could have avoided a lot of suffering"" because I know that find someone like her is very rare and, anyways, she turns my days way lighter and brighter, and hard things have become easier to do. My greatest fear was how my body would react when we got close. I'm not talking about sex, and I don't want to think about it until the marriage(we're both evangelicals so it's ok), but normal physical contact. Fortunately, I discovered that I like her touch, and stay close feels very confortable, like the opposite I used to feel. I'm not gonna lie, I still have nightmares, flashbacks and panic, I still struggle with porn sometimes(very very few times, but when it happens I feel like those days), but I'm doing my best. When I feel depressed, it's like the time around me had stopped and I don't have forces to do anything, but I'm taking less time to recover than in other times. I've made good friends in the church and work, and the familiy of my girl is like a second family for me. Well, today my life is divided by fews days when I feel absolutely hopeless and some days when I have force, even feeling bad, shameful and empty I can do my best to have a future when I'll be free of this.

&#x200B;

PS: if someone is worried about my brother and cousins, they are all well. I really don't believe they went through this things, I've always kept an eye over all of them to not let the same thing that happened to me happen to them, and they are all ok, both physical and mentally.

"Today, a random man saved my life.",88,0.98,2023-11-22 14:54:34,"The last few years have been escalating and escalating.

I berated myself for not being where I wanted to be. I blamed myself for every single failure, and couldn't see a way out. I pretended, I masked, until I allowed it to continue spiralling to this point. I spent months in utter silence, rejecting any support thrown my way.  

Today, an academic advisor from my university did not show up to a very important meeting which I barely managed to fit in before my deadline. I was at a breaking point, feeling that I somehow just needed to summon every last bit of energy in myself to deal with the irritating and never-ending minute problems of every single day. All these minute things had become far more important than anything else.

So, this happy, queer, and relatably autistic and disorganised man I already vaguely knew took me in instead. I'd seen him before, he had forgotten something he needed to submit from me, some silly admin thing. We had laughed about the fact that two severely ADD people would forget about this tiny thing months and months on end, having the same conversation every 6 months when the dread would pop back in our minds. 

Today, he took me in. Nonchalantly, the busiest man I know just went ""Since you're already here, come in! No problem."" 

He not only heard me, but he told me exactly what I needed to hear, and he probably has absolutely no idea. I know he saw me. He never blamed me, he never made me feel ashamed of myself. In the few minutes after he had noticed that I was sitting outside an empty office with my advisor missing, he already went to find all information he could on me so that he could give me the best advice. He told me I mattered, he told me I belonged, and he gave me the one thing I felt I had lost; he reminded me that I do have control over my life. I can decide where I go. It doesn't matter that my path doesn't look the way I thought it 'should' (whatever that means), and that it doesn't look the way my peers' do. 

Leaving that office, after a mere thirty minute conversation with him, I walked 2 hours before coming home, before sitting and writing a thank you to him, and before realising that he had just saved my life. 

You have nothing to lose by knocking on doors when you need it. Do not underestimate what help can do for you, no matter the scale of it. That's it; this nice friendly academic advisor. Not my meds, not my psychiatrist, not my doctors, not even my loved ones. You never know - life is just as capable of sending you a lifeline as it is capable of sending you difficulties.

I can't stop thinking about my brother,89,0.97,2023-11-08 01:31:25,"Hi everyone.  
What I’m about to write will probably be super confusing, disgusting, and weird. But, I have no one I can tell and so, I’m here on Reddit telling strangers. 

  
My(21) brother(19) is always doing explicit sexual things in front of me. Not entirely explicit, but explicit enough. He likes to go around the house naked. He comes in my room and stands by my bed and waves his dick at me. He asks me if I want to suck it. He comes in my room in the morning with morningwood and in his underwear. At random times, he’ll come in my room gully dressed, but grabbing is crotch and asking me to stroke it through his jeans. He always comments on my body and always tries and sometimes does grab my butt. He says, word for word “You have such a fucking juicy ass” “Get on the bed” “I’m gonna fuck you”. He moans our names and will randomly be sitting their and moans “oh oh I’m gonna cum”.

  
There’s so much more but in the moment I can’t remember.

  
Now I know, the simple solution to this would be to lock my door. But he will break down my door.   
Or I could tell my parents, but they already know and they don’t care. They say “he’s crazy, there’s nothing we can do about it”. They don’t understand that my brothers actions are effecting me mentally. Another solution would be for me to move out. But, I love my mom and if I left, my dad and his family would emotionally and mentally abuse my mom. Which is not something I would like. However this is probably what I will do in the near future.

  
I’m not here really looking for a solution though. Especially since I do plan on moving out in a year after saving some more money. I’m here just to put how I feel into words, especially in regards to how it is effecting me. I didn’t realize just how badly my brother doing this was a effecting me until recently. I’m an avid romance novel reader. However, I can not get through the romantic/explicit scenes in books anymore. My brother keeps popping up in my mind and I immediately have to close the book. I can’t even masturbate without his image. And it turns me off. I don’t think I can even have someone touch me or hear sexual words without my brothers face coming in my mind. 

  
It’s killing me on the inside and I don’t know what to do. It’s disgusting and I’m trying so hard to block it out, but I can’t. I just want to have fun, live life, read a damn romance book in peace, but I can’t.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify that I am female, as some people are wondering. Also, it seems like people think that this post is some sort of incest porn fantasy. Which to me, sounds outrageous and honestly pretty hurtful and it seems like people are trying to invalidate what goes on in my life. But this is my reality. I find my brother absolutely disgusting, however, I huge part of me feels helpless.

I've been trying multiple pain meds and depression meds that have not helped, though I've learned to manage the pain without meds. 

The issue is, that I've been noticing a slow but steady deterioration of my mental sharpness, I don't feel as mental sharp, feels like a slog to come up with ideas or even basic things.. like coming up with conversation topics or keeping up with conversations. I have EXTREME short term memory loss, sometimes I bring myself a glass of water and can't even remember going to get it.. or remembering what I just said in a span of 5 mins. I also have a tough time recollecting broad information. At the start, when it was milder, I thought it was a normal aging process, but as I got worse I couldnt help but think there was something more going on and Im extremely worried this will only get worse with time. Brain fog and feeling stupid most of the time.. and while I don't want to make myself seem full of myself, but I felt I was an extremely smart and sharp kid. I can barely recognize myself

"My therapist made a racial comment. Im desperate for therapy, but think I should cut her loose. Am I overreacting?",86,0.92,2024-03-27 18:26:13,"I just started therapy again, and have had 3 sessions with a therapist. I am a Black female and my therapist is a Black female.

We were discussing something related to germs. I can sometimes be “overly clean” and a bit of a “clean freak” which sometimes crosses the line into unhealthy and causes me anxiety. 

My fiancé is a white male. And although I don’t recall exactly what was said before my therapist  made the racial comment, I think i was   talking to her about how when we go to our Friends’ houses I often get picky about what I eat, drink out of etc.

Anyway, I forget what was said directly before she made this statement, but at one point my therapist said:  “Well, you know White people can be a little …..” . And  either she finished the sentence with “not that clean” OR, she made a face suggesting unclean. I honestly can’t remember, but her tone and body language made it very clear what she was suggesting. She was assuming it was a white person’s house and was essentially saying “Well maybe you being picky about those things is justified since white people can be a little nasty.” 

People are very comfortable talking to me, and in this case I think she got waaaaay too comfortable and slipped and shared this thought/bias like I’m just one of her friends.

I honestly  don’t think she is racist or meant any harm, BUT the comment was troublesome(for my reasons below) and I don’t think I want to work with her anymore. But I really need therapy. Should I stay or get on the hunt for someone else?

Why am I not allowed to exist??,81,0.86,2023-12-10 10:01:12,"I'm sitting in a shopping mall and every time someone walks by me, I can literally feel their thoughts:

Like I'm not doing anything bad! Stop judging me people! 

I almost want to shake the people around me and ask, ""what?? What do you want?? Why do you hate me? Why am I not good enough?!""

I'm extremely exposed and sensitive. Everyone can see how disgusting I am. And their judgement very much affects me. I'm submitted to them, like will some of these strangers actually validate me and allow me to exist?

Even worse is when someone does something that my shame doesn't let me do. Like talk loud, breathe loud, take up space.. Like stop that! I would call the police on these people.

Seriously it's very unfair that I'm so mindful of how much I ""exist"", while they just push through. It should be illegal.

Traumatized by being tasered and handcuffed by police during wellness check,84,0.97,2023-05-25 13:35:36,"Has anyone else ever been apprehended by police or had force used on them during a mental health situation and if if you have how do you cope with it? If you haven’t, what do you think about this and would you cope?

So a few months ago I called 911 because I felt like self harming. First I actually called something called here 24/7 which a mental health hotline and they told me if I want to self harm then I should probably call the police. 

My partner was with me and called with me and we both told the 911 dispatch I was feeling like self harming and I had a small kitchen knife to my thigh but I didn’t cut yet.

I told the 911 dispatch I was afraid the police would hurt me because I know they are aggressive sometimes and I work for the newspaper so I hear about what happens. She reassured me that are coming to “help” and I’ve had the police called by neighbours for arguments between my bf and I before and usually they’ve somewhat helpful, one time they even brought a mental health counsellor so I thought it would be like that. I just wanted some intervention to help me get out of that crazy head space.

So when the police came barging in they were screaming drop the knife (I was holding it to my leg lol) and I said no ONCE before I could even look up they tasered me. They had a riot shield, a gun and a taser pointed me at me when they came barging in screaming at me. Mind you, this is Canada.

The police officer who tasered me kept apologizing and saying to my bf “my friend just died like this and I panicked” or some shit. Like wow. The female cop there and the EMS told me there is usually a lot of deescalation tactics before that like they try to talk you down and stuff but they didn’t and they usually ever use force if they feel in danger. They told me to file a report against them because it was  very abnormal and they felt sorry for me. Imagine. 

They told me to and my mom told me to file a report and even get a lawyer because guess what when I got to the hospital they told me the police wrote on the report I said I “wanted to die by suicide by police” like yoooo I said the complete opposite to the dispatcher!!! I was AFRAID of them hurting me. I would never ever say something so foolish and I am NOT suicidal. So, they told me I should clear my name because it’s not safe or good at all to have that on my file and next time something happens they’ll be even more aggressive.

But I didn’t wanna relive the trauma so I didn’t (stupid) and fast forward to this week a neighbour called cause my bf and I got into a huge fight and I had a mark on my head cause I self harmed by hitting my head against the wall. They asked me and him if I was suicidal and we both said no not at all. They didn’t even ask me to go with them in the ambulance like usual for the mandatory mental health check, the paramedics came and asked me if I wanted to get my HEAD looked at and I said no. The police said ONCE “you’re going to the hospital for a check” and I was holding my cat in my arms and said “I don’t want to though” once and they literally attacked me so fast twisted my arms so aggressively and handcuffed me. I was crying yelling like WTF I WILL GO VOLUNTARILY U DONT NEED TO HANDCUFF ME UR HURTING ME. It was horrible they hurt me so much and dragged me like an animal when I kept saying unhandcuff me I will go voluntarily….if I had known they were gonna do that I obviously would’ve just went. Why would I want to be handcuffed and treated like that? I’m not that crazy.

I was at the hospital for 10 hours alone with no phone waiting to be discharged bc there was only 1 ER doctor and my bf “couldn’t handle being there and needed space” or some shit.

I *think* I have trauma due to movies my father puts on,85,0.83,2024-03-06 04:11:50,"TRIGGER WARNING: MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FEARS 

I don’t want to use the word trauma incorrectly but I said it because I feel like I have symptoms of it.

The story is that since I was around 12, my dad would put on movies that involved women being sexually assaulted and abused. They bothered me but they didn’t horrify me as much as when I was 16. That year my dad put on two movies called “Hollow Man” and “Sleepers” which are also movies that also featured sexual assault but for some reason these movies made me cry the most and still scares me to this day (I’m 19 going onto 20 now). The scenes of these movies essentially come back to my memory randomly if I get too deep in my thoughts and it rattles me. It’s been so bad that the horror even affects me when I am in public. I feel uncomfortable when people look at me and I worry they may try to hurt me or even my loved ones. The thoughts of the scenes and the idea of people hurting me and loved ones like that plague me more now that I am studying so much and sleeping less. It also makes me anxious whenever my father puts on a movie to the point I google the plot to mentally prepare. I tend to watch kids movies because I know that will be safe.

However, I am becoming older and will soon have to have my own life outside of my parents so I am more afraid of stepping into this scary world myself.

And they would erupt even more. So now, whenever anyone yells at me, I just cry. And my fight-and-flight response gets triggered. 

2) not showing interest in MY interests. When I was growing up, my parents (esp. my mom) didn't really show any reaction to what I liked. For instance, when I would tell her about it, she would just shrug.

I think I’m being emotionally abused and I don’t know what to do,83,0.98,2023-08-09 11:49:33,"I’m 35F and have been married for a decade now. I’m Indian and this is an arranged marriage.

Within 3 months of my marriage, my husband got to know of a past relationship of mine, something I hadn’t shared with him. I was no longer in touch with my x and it seemed pretty pointless bringing him up. But this was something he was (and still is) unable to overlook. He made me call my parents, my brother and threatened to divorce me, leaving everyone in a bad spot within our community.

Of course, the divorce didn’t happen, but thus began the unending emotional abuse. From gaslighting, twisting my words, to blaming me for his depression (since knowing your wife has an x is valid grounds for depression) he covered the entire nine yards. 

Things got better late 2021, I’m not entirely sure why. I think it was because thanks to Covid, we were forced to wfh, be with each other for hours on end. He possibly saw me for the person I am - and not what he made presumed I’ll be.

Flash forward to today. Last night, he wanted to get intimate. But having worked 12 hours at a high stress job, plus the extra effort to take care of his parents (who are currently visiting us), my cup was empty. Come this morning and he vehemently said - “I cannot continue to stay married to you. I feel disrespected. My parents are here, I’ll share all the truth about your past and divorce you.” That’s always the sword he’s wielding at me.

Edit: STOP DM-ing FOR NUDES!!!!!! I’m gonna block y’all

———————————————————————————
ADDITIONAL EDIT: just wanna give a few updates from after talking to my therapist and after reading some of your suggestions too. (I haven’t read all of them esp the very recent ones—was planning to reply to them, but I’m losing all my energy now as it’s 3 AM here already in my place). A little TMI, I’m also diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder.

Here’s what my therapist said: [ … You can send it to your friends, or post in anonymous Twitter account with 0 follower. You can take as many as you can (to get you distracted) then back it up on your Cloud/Drive account. Send it to yourself is also another alternative. Make sure those photos do not feature your face. Better yet, keep your phone under lock & key and only retrieve it when you are calmed down. Hope it helps. You got this! ]

What I did by far:
1. Creating a spare insta account with 0 followers, started by uploading my normal, non-nudes selfies, ended up not sending nudes at all because I was too busy looking at my selfies and uploading them right before I got to open my hidden nudes folder haha (sorry if it sounds too cringeworthy—kinda feel cute these days). 

2. Impulsively uploaded normal, proper selfies to a subreddit and somehow felt better about it (except for some of the disgusting DMs part). Hope it doesn’t sound narcissistic but, it felt good looking at the number of DM requests though I didn’t reply to them [BUT I truly don’t appreciate some of the DMs coming from this particular post from r/mentalhealth because, apparently, those people intentionally take advantage of me and no, I don’t reply to them :)]

3. Talked to someone, felt good. Made up with my crush, had a good talk with him and he said sorry for not being there for me for the past few days. Had a video call with him as well.

After (1) and (2) I felt calmer, and after (3) I felt amazing.

WHY I TRY HARD NOT TO POST MY NUDES:

[I saw some of you suggesting me to post on Reddit with a throwaway account without my face on, or creating an OF account, or sending it to friends.]

Why I clearly avoid doing that: as weird as it may sound, I’m actually just trying to honor my idealistic principle of thinking that nudes = exclusive, I particularly take them for someone special and send them only to that particular person.

When I said I wanted to send nudes this morning I didn’t take anything new—I was about to send my old nudes from a few months ago. Which was taken for my crush.

In my previous experience, I had to send my nudes at least to 2 or 3 people not out of my will, I just kinda got “groomed” onto it or because I couldn’t clearly say no—only to regret it afterwards. Wasn’t even thinking of my own safety at the time, I was solely disappointed at how I “betrayed” my own principle (NOT betraying my crush, since I’m not yet exclusively in a committed relationship with him anyway). Yeah I’m idealistic AF.

And this I guess is my very first time, for whatever reason (seeking validation? Wanting some tension? Not sure, I guess the first one) I want to share my nudes when (presumably) I’m about to enter my hypomanic episode (in my previous hypomanic episode I was about to fuck random ass dudes, thank god I canceled the plan). And that’s why I was very confused, by my brain was still alerted that I shouldn’t be doing that at all.

So yeah. Sorry for the long ass update. Thank you for some of the nice and supportive DMs — had read some of them, but I no longer have the energy to reply for today.

"is it OK for a father to slap his
daughter's ass as a joke?",82,0.84,2024-02-25 18:48:46,"I'm a 20 years old only child, and my father has always been like this. I remember he'd try to kiss me on the lips when I was 7-10. When I got older, I began refusing because I understood that it's not a normal thing that fathers do with their daughters. He's also touched me inappropriately a lot of times. Every single day, he wants a hug and a kiss and gets mad at me whenever I refuse. He also keeps asking me to sit on his lap. 

It makes me extremely uncomfortable. Is it normal, or am I just overreacting as he claims? He says that it's him being ""affectionate."" 

He'd also sexually assaulted me by, it's so disgusting that I don't even wanna type it out, but, licking my nipples when i was 8 and asking me to touch his yk what. My grandfather - his father - has also done this to me, but I stopped seeing him after I turned 10. He even almost forced me to touch him in the middle of the street until I screamed and he let go of me. Neither of them knows what the other one did, but I guess it does come by genes.

My parents divorced when I was around 10-12, but it wasn't for this reason.

Why does this happen to me? Why couldn't I have a normal family? Now I'm 20, I've never had a boyfriend because talking to guys makes me uncomfortable and every single time a guy is acting nice towards me my daddy issues start acting up and I feel like he's trying to get something from me. I'm so desperate for a relationship at this point, but I'm also too scared to commit to one. 

And the worst thing is that even tho he's done unspeakable things to me, I still want to give him a chance and forgive him. He wasn't a bad father besides being a pedophile. And I hate myself for it, but I just want my dad to be my dad. It's not a surprise if i confess that i feel attracted towards older men than guys my age, and it disgusts me. I keep searching for a father figure in every single man that I meet. Whether it's my teacher or a bus driver. But deep down, I know that the only man a girl could trust with her life is her father.

Broken man biking across Canada-Update,77,0.99,2023-06-11 16:50:09,"Quick who am I. 
I am a 320lb man suffering from severe depression and other mental/physical issues and a month ago I decided to jump on my bike and pedal my ass across the Country. Well, almost across. Moncton NB to Vancouver. 

I'm unsure how to link previous posts maybe someone could be so kind to do that for me in the comments? Or just go to my profile if you're interested in reading more. 


***TRIGGER WARNING***
These updates are raw and real and I talk openly about my struggles with depression but also how Cycling effects those struggles. 


What is a 40lb update you may ask? It's the amount of weight I have lost in 4 weeks. 

When I left Moncton I was 320. I weighed myself yesterday and was 279. 

My jaw dropped. I knew I lost weight, I could see it and feel it. But forty fucking pounds?? 

I was with a host, my first host on this trip and he and his wife were so kind and so accommodating, I truly will remember them both for the rest of my days. It humbles me and as he seen first hand, I'm a very emotional dude. Depression has broken me, but their kindness broke me too and what they did for me will only fuel the fire that under me right now. 

But 40lbs!!! 

When I set out to do this the goal, as you may all remember, was to end up in BC a different and a better man.  A strong man both in body and mind and I can see and feel the changes now just a month in. 

There was a moment when I thought this was having zero positive effect on my mental health, but I was wrong. Everything that could go wrong had gone wrong and yet I still wake up each morning and head west. The other day I found out my EI claim was denied, I went into the bush and sat there thinking this was it. I formulated a plan in my head. Simple, quick, painless. Like I've thought about a million times, except this time for the first time the darkness passed in minutes and not hours or days. 

Imagine being in a dark room, it's pitch black, scary and noisy. Usually after hours or days i just find myself standing outside that room. I don't know I got there but I'm there. Outside the darkness and the noise and I carry on with my day. 

This time was different. As I was sitting there in that dark room the noise was being drown out by thoughts of and the feelings of energy and enthusiasm and excitement. I cannot explain why or how this happened, it's never happened to me before, but I found myself in my head with my thoughts being able to feel the positivity and, well, the light. 

I was outside of that dark room but after minutes and not only did I find myself outside of the room I was running from it, the energy I felt was like poitive emotions at war with the dark and destroying them so fast. 

I called my sister and told her I'm continuing, this can still happen. The world is changing around me, I am changing. I can do this. 


It feels like I should not be surprised by this but since that day the world has given me my two new friends in Ottawa who filled my bags with food (my gracious hosts) its given me a new supporter who just so happens to work with MEC (huge outdoor supply store in Canada) and had offered to help with gear, bike repairs, solar charger, ect. across Canada and has continued to give me an amazingly supportive community via reddit and Insta who message and share and even donate. 

This trip is me getting my self in order, becoming a better man so I can then advocate for other Wards of the Court who are like me, broken and lost. 

This journey has shown me that despite the darkness the world brings, there's always light around that corner and all I have to do is keep pedaling. 

There are days I don't want to, but I have to. Too much is at stake. 

I'm hitting Ontario today. This is when the real long slog starts. 4-6 weeks before I get to the other side. I'm taking the #11 all the way to the #1 going to put my head down and just pedal. 

Pedaling through adversity.

Struggling with Depression? Don't Forget About Your Dental Health!,75,0.98,2023-07-18 12:00:01,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share a reminder about the importance of taking care of your dental health, especially if you're dealing with depression. I know firsthand how easy it is to neglect our oral hygiene when we're feeling down, but trust me, it can have serious consequences.



For years, my depression kept me from properly caring for my teeth. I often relied on sugary snacks or even recreational drugs to cope, which only worsened the situation. Yesterday, I finally went to the dentist after 6 long years, and I was shocked to find out that I have significant gum disease. I could potentially lose my teeth, and the dental fees will take me at least a year to pay off.



If you're reading this and realizing that it's been a while since your last dental visit, and if you have the means to afford a checkup, I urge you to go. Dentists are there to help, and they won't judge you. Trust me, they've seen it all. Taking care of your oral hygiene now can save you from expensive dental procedures and years of pain in the future.



I understand that not everyone can afford dental care, and I apologize for not acknowledging this privilege in my initial post. So, instead, I would like to encourage everyone, regardless of their financial situation, to do what they can for their oral hygiene. Even if it's as simple as committing to brushing your teeth every day or making small improvements, it can make a world of difference.",mentalhealth,Acceptable-Point4378,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/152whsn/struggling_with_depression_dont_forget_about_your/,7,76.53061224489797,1.5306122448979664,0.00016326217148875642

Why I’ll never cry in front of a women again…,72,0.84,2023-08-08 00:23:49,"When I was around the age of 13-15 I was going to a middle school event on a Friday night, where there would be a whole bunch of fun activities to do. 
On the way there my mom was driving me and as we got there she decided to tell me that my uncle had actually committed suicide a few weeks ago. Hearing that he passed almost a whole month ago and not being told this really made my heart sink to the bottom of my stomach and the only thing I could respond with was “oh”

Anyways after I was dropped off I was obviously completely confused and upset about the whole situation but I tried to keep myself calm and collected, and went to go find my friends to go hang out with.
Everything was going fine at first, I was distracted by my friends and all of the fun games and activities to do there so it was overall pretty fun.

There was a lazar tag inside of the gym in our school so there was a giant line of people who were waiting to play and me and my big group of friends decided to wait the long line, as time goes on we get to the front of the line but I didn’t realize that I was going to be the only one left out because there were already a few people in front of us that got in before we did and I had to be left out, so I waited for them to get back and I went and sat on the stairs.

As I was left alone with my thoughts I started remembering about my uncle who I had suddenly been informed had committed suicide and I was on the verge of tears so I was trying to hide my face in my knees. 
As I was sitting there with my head down a group of 3 girls had noticed me and came to talk to me (after 10 minutes of me sitting there without anyone talking to me)

Anyways they decided to come up to me and ask if I was okay and for some reason hearing those words just made me absolutely break down into tears and I just sobbed into my knees. I tried to speak up but I was choking up on my own tears which made the one to talk to me look confused.
The worse part about this is when I was trying to breathe but I was hyperventilating and they straight up just gave me the cold shoulder and walked away. 
How could you ask someone if their okay and see they are obviously not doing okay and then just leave them there without trying to talk to them?

My sisters mental illness is destroying my home life,73,0.98,2023-08-02 02:01:01,"I never post my first time visiting a sub, but I would truly appreciate some genuine kindness and feedback from people. My sister’s mental illness is tearing my family apart and I don’t know what to do. 

Also, just as a disclaimer, as her only brother/sibling, I obviously do care for my sister very much, but she makes it difficult to maintain any kind of positive relationship. I am in no way on here to drag her, and will not be using her name. 

My sister, who is 34 now (4 years older than me), has suffered mental health issues since she was a teenager, but it came to a head her senior year of college. She had a manic episode on Thanksgiving Day of 2010, left campus, passed out on the side of the highway, and wound up in the hands of the highway patrol. I’m still super thankful she had the wherewithal to call them/anyone herself, I hate to think of what could have happened. The details are still pretty sketchy, but are not the important factor. She was never the same, and was almost totally incoherent for a solid month after in the psych ward. She has basically been in and out of psych wards around the state at least 2-4 times a year in the ensuing 13 years since. The original diagnosis was some sort of medical gray area schizo-effective bipolar disorder, but I believe it has evolved into borderline personality disorder. 

She ended up leaving her career over it, and is now disabled. Every year that passes since she started getting her disability checks, her health has gotten steadily worse. On top of the issues I’ve stated, she’s also severely overweight and diabetic, can’t handle her own finances, has had a bunch of issues with her thyroid, and her meds either completely sedate her or throw her into a non stop mania, and she is incapable of functioning for days/weeks at times because of it. 

My parents were totally unprepared for all of this. My sister was an honors student, had all kinds of accomplishments to be proud of in high school, and sort of seemed to have her life planned out when she started college. I know no one does, but no parent is ever ready for something like this to happen, it was and is still pretty traumatic.

My folks still look after her (she has never been able to live on her own) and she puts us all through the wringer daily. I moved back home 2 years ago when I was on some truly hard times. At first it was fine, and I learned to be patient with her. Now her attitude has become so vindictive to the point she assumes we all hate her, and that our own mother has a vendetta out to screw her over. She’s completely delusional about this, and I’ve had some arguments with her over it when my temper boils over. I’m not going to let anyone cuss out either of our parents (in front of me AND them). Our mother is her power of attorney and controls most of her savings at this point. It’s just the way my sis talks about her, you’d think our mother beat the hell out of us as kids or something, it’s some truly nasty shit she says. 

She is struggling now more than I think she ever has, her mania and mood swings are so bad that she’s delusional and angry all the time, every day. It’s getting very hard to keep being patient, and to stay at home through all of this. My parents and I have all agreed that this behavior is making us all miserable and sort of codependent with her suffering. Sister is making all of our home lives very chaotic. I get to hear her screaming or sobbing at the top of her lungs nearly every day, usually directed at me or whoever is home. And I’m not sure she even realizes it or cares how she’s affecting us. In turn it is making me callous to her entire condition. It’s hard enough to even be at home witnessing her being this disrespectful. This means if I’m not working 50-60+ hours a week, I am at home arguing with what’s left of my only sibling and watching her life fall deeper into the shitter. 

Sister is supposed to receive a deal on affordable housing very soon, but we all of course seriously doubt that she will be able to take care of herself. None of us know what to do. We assume she will move out and be back home again within a few months and in even worse shape. And it especially wears down my retired father, who she has been truly awful to in the past few months. 

I guess the point I’m getting at is that I can’t figure out what to do now. I feel like if I move out, I completely waste my opportunity to save loads of cash so that I can buy a home. I have begun saving, and it is quite possible by next spring if I keep working and saving. But if I stay, I also have to keep dealing with this... I think it’s fair to say she will never be “cured,” and that the best she can hope for is that it gets more manageable. That also seems unlikely. 

I went back to online therapy recently, and am considering going back to my old in-person therapist to work out some of these issues and other personal problems I’ve had over the past few years. My sis and my parents have also totally rejected going to family/group therapy whenever I bring it up.

Something that doesn’t help my situation is I don’t like myself.  I don’t like that I have essential tremors (shakiness) in my hands.  I don’t like that I have some acne on my neck and back.  I don’t like that my personality is not the type that’s the “life of the party” for lack of a better word.  I don’t like that I have some redness in my eyes unless I use special eye drops.

I thought by cutting all of that out, routinely working out, and dressing better - that girls would approach me or show cues that they’re interested in me.

It is fucking hard to swallow the idea that nothing will change unless you basically start immersing yourself in your fears.

"I am not proud of my job, ashamed even, I feel like 'less' of a person, and possibly for no reason. How could I get out of this?",72,1.0,2023-07-12 12:50:27,"Hi all.

All of my life I had ambition, I wanted to be an artist in video games, I got there but it wasn't quite right. But it was still awesome. It was awesome for 2 years until I was made redundant in the recession. Since then I needed a job, any job, and I landed a job as an artworker. (for artworker think of graphic design, but the difference between a chef and a cook as being the difference between an artworker and a designer)

I like it well enough but all I do is practical problem solve, I don't do anything creative, I do the practical side of the business. So we have a logo that has been updated, it is now my job to get it updated on 10,000 documents. It is challenging sometimes but most of the time I feel like a factory worker. 

The thing is, many would love my job, many would like the simplicity of just doing practical work not creative stuff. 

But I feel ashamed of it. Like I wanted to be an artist, but now I just push buttons, noting unique or creative. Not many designers could do what I do because it would bore them, and they wouldn't think analytically enough to do this kind of work. But they still think they are superior (and have shown it).

A new job sounds like it is the way to go but I have no idea what togo into, and I earn 30k which is kind of where the cut off is, I could be a designer and earn no more. So my wage isn't even bad (no great in a cost of living crisis, but not bad either).

I just don't feel right?

I got divorced last year and it messed my head up, I am so envious of friends who are in the military but I am 35...I can't do that. And I gave up my chance because my ex didn't want me to do it. 

&#x200B;

I just don't like what I do, I feel embarrassed by it. Im not a designer or an artist I am more like a technician at best. I feel like I have up opportunities to do other things because others didnt want em to do that and I put others first naturally. 

It has gotten to a point where I sort of don't even want to open my eyes in the morning. I am ok once i am moving more or less but in the mornings i am bad. On m drive to work today I fleetingly imagined just turning the wheel and going off the side of the road. Just because it would put an end to this monotony. 

I don't want this to be my legacy...making forms for clients...but I don't want to jump just because the grass may be greener. 

I just feel lost. And ever since the divorce I have been feeling worse and worse.

I got fired because of my mental health,68,0.95,2023-08-21 21:40:03,"So I only worked at this job for a few months but never called out I have ADHD and depression but I still came in even if my depression was bad at the moment. This week someone very close to me had a stroke they already had a stroke a few weeks before that and I and the family believe they may not make it. I was really upset but I did work that day so I went in and tried to push through. I was able to do my job I just wasn’t as talkative with customers (I worked in retail) so the next day I was supposed to work I had a mental breakdown it was bad it was a mix of that situation, financial situations, my relationship, my best friend leaving for basic training, etc and I was just so overwhelmed I had a breakdown I was balling on the floor I was hyperventilating I couldn’t breathe my bf told me he will call them and inform them of the situation and that I cannot speak due to this. He gave them a call and told them I was having a breakdown I cannot speak on the phone and that I am in no condition to work today this was 7 hours before my shift (when I have these breakdowns they last at least the entire day but it's very rare when these things happen I usually can hold my composure) so he got off the phone and said ok so what I’m gonna say may upset you and I’m very sorry and I knew immediately. He said that they said “Is this like a long-term thing because we need workers who aren’t you know. that. so we are gonna end her employment because we need employees who can give their best attitudes and show up to work if she wants to apply in 6 months she can but she has to be happy and healthy” I was just flabbergasted I didn’t even know what to say this was the first and only time I called in. The store wasn’t short staffed and there were 2 other closers there so I already had coverage and since it was Night Shift it was gonna be very slow. I just am not sure what to even think about this.


Edit: when I said this week I meant last week I forgot today was Monday this whole thing happened yesterday on Sunday I apologize for that

Another edit: thank you all very much for your advice I read all of it and took it all into serious consideration. For those saying my bf should have just said I was sick you are all right. I do believe he was in a panic due to the state I was in I actually showed him all of the comments and he agreed if anything like this ever happens again at another job I will just say I am sick and then I’ll explain my reason IF they ask I don’t like to lie about why I am calling out I’ve always been an honest person but seeing some of these comments made me realize that sometimes you gotta just say “I got the flu” or something I actually will talk to my bf because we do live together if we should take legal advice or honestly just leave it as it is luckily because we do have rent so I have to work my bf messaged his boss if they could hire me at his job and they scheduled me for an interview tomorrow so hopefully it goes well. I was told by him we cannot work the same shifts due to the risk of us breaking up and causing drama in his work environment which is perfectly fine with me.

Is it normal to conclude life at 30?,69,0.99,2023-07-26 23:56:16,"I'm 27, I'm from London UK, I work a job that goes against my personality, I have maybe 2 friends at most, I have never had a girlfriend for the entirety of my life & I don't think I ever will. Growing up I was never diagnosed for my mental health but I'm convinced I'm on the spectrum for autism due to the fact I've dealt with Body Dysmorphic Disorder since as early as age 4 & used maladaptive daydreaming as a coping mechanism to this day. Safe to say my reality is not meeting up the standards, I feel like I've plateaued in life when it comes to improving my mental health. 

I'm turning 28 in November & I have never left the country once, never really enjoyed my 20s due to the fact i can't adjust to social cues. Everything feels forced with me, I used to think I was ugly growing up & I relentlessly focused all my energy on improving my physical appearance. Safe to say now I think im handsome due to the change of reception I get from women but I still don't believe it due to how I was treated by them when I was younger (PTSD perhaps?)... The breaking point for me now is knowing my Mum may never see me have a child at this rate, she is ill & currently disabled in her mid 50s. It breaks my heart all the time knowing she wants to see her grandchild & I also want this but I've always hated myself so much to the point I could never comprehend letting a woman into my life. I feel like I can offer physical attraction, mental wisdom & a reassuring outlook on actual relationships despite never being in one. But outside that, I work an average job, I've got no friends, I'm a virgin, I can't drive & I'm limited on what enjoyment I can actively bring to a woman due to the fact I've never experienced much in my life. This itself has recently stopped me going for a woman I really admire even though she is also going through her own grievances. 

I've always told myself if I just had a taste of what life a normal person gets to enjoy, I'd be way better but I'm yet to come close to those necessities.  I'm inclined to end my life at 30 if I'm yet to develop & change. I can be the wisest in the shed, without experience I have no proof for my brain to validate a fixated behaviour pattern of normal functional living. I am saddened at the idea to hurt my mother further by ending my life at 30 if I'm to be in the same boat but something in me can't accept how people have it easy in life & I don't even have the basic privileges to even live life.

I feel trapped & I feel burdened by my brain, I'm tired of rationalising all the time. Tired of relying on dopamine from content or being reliant on endorphin release from the gym to feel positive. I'm putting a positive front but deep down I'm dying inside. People can say it's ""depression"", but like I said if I haven't experienced anything my brain has no proof to feel validated, for example it's like labeling someone for laughing because they got tickled. Granted the circumstances I'm in, feeling the way I do is a reasonable byproduct and the fact I persevered with low self esteem for my entire life, it shows I'm far from just dwelling over the idea of depression.  

All I can say is, I'll be taking it to the next level  but I'll be open about my experience. If this doesn't work then nothing will work for me.

Why is suicide wrong?,69,0.86,2024-01-09 18:30:07,"Just a disclaimer, I'm not suicidal. I sometimes have suicidal thoughts, but I would never act on them.  
  
So I have severe social anxiety and I find it extremely difficult to relate or fit in with anyone. I oftentimes feel like I'm only doing things just because I want to have friends and fit in with a certain group of people, and it makes me confused about my identity; who I really am, what I value, what I like or don't like, etc. It's like a self-imposed peer pressure. Everything I do, I'm always asking myself, ""Why do I want to do this? Who am I doing this for?""  
  
For example, I got my first (ear) piercing last year and told my therapist at the time about it. At first, she was concerned that I did it because I felt like I needed to in order to fit in. I told her that I actually wanted to and that it was something I was thinking about doing for a whille. She said it was fine as long as I wanted to do it.  
  
So how is suicide different? Why is it wrong? If you genuinely wanted to kill yourself, why shouldn't you do it? What if you just don't want to be alive? What if you just hate it? People always say, ""Do what YOU want to do,"" but why shouldn't I kill myself? Shouldn't I be doing what I want to do? It's my life and my choice, so how does anyone have the right to tell me no, it's wrong? If I wanted to kill myself, why shouldn't I be allowed to do it?  
  
If people have the freedom to do anything they want with their life and they decide that this is something they genuinely want to do, why is it always frowned upon? ""No you shouldn't do it. Your family will hurt. It's selfish."" Well, it's MY life and MY choice. If I didn't want to be here anymore, then I think it would be selfish of others to try to convince me and force me to keep me here. If someone is genuinely suffering and they just genuinely wanted to leave, how is it not selfish for others to tell them otherwise? What gives them the right to take that choice away from them? If someone wanted to walk into a clinic that offers assisted suicide, why shouldn't they be allowed to do it? Why aren't people given the freedom to choose whether they want to live or die?

Earlier today I went to pick up a passenger...it was booked by what I assume was his boss...and the destination was an urgent care that is mostly for workman's comp.  So during the ride he was talking about his hurt knee...then went into how his life is unraveling.   So I sympathetically listened to him....halfway to the destination he starts complaining of chest pains. I asked if he was OK and needed assistance. 

So I pull over on the shoulder of the highway...call 911..then proceed to make him comfortable..keep him calm and alert while we waited...all while checking his pulse and etc.  He was starting to have more pain...then nothing...no pulse.  So here i am...in the back seat performing cpr until the paramedics arrived...and were able to us a defibrillator and revive him.  Then off they went blazing in an ambulance.   He is only 42....2 years older than me.   

I don't know how to feel.  How to process everything.   The police and paramedics told me I might have helped save his life...and how great it was...and listening to uber's safety manager telling me on the phone how I did a great thing and so on...

PLEASE HELP! I am mentally disabled snd my mental health care and medications have been taken away with no warning for no reason. What do I do?,66,0.92,2023-06-06 10:47:31,"Hi! I really need your help in figuring out what to do in this situation. First off, I am disabled because of a myriad of mental health disorders. OCD, CHRONIC PTSD, GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER, BIPOLAR DISORDER, PANIC DISORDER, and ADHD. 
I am a patient at a telehealth corporation called Eleanor Health. I had been seeing the most amazing, kind, compassionate,and caring psychiatriast I have ever met in my life for since December. She was also giving me DBT therapy.I was rapidly improving and on a path to a great place mentally, until it was all taken away. 
About three weeks ago my appointments with her started to be postponed. I was instead scheduled with a nurse practitoner who had no knowledge of mental health care whatsoever. There was no explation of why I could not see my doctor. My medications were being shuffled around, or threatened to be taken away. This past month has been one of the most stressful months of my life not knowing what was going on. 
They finally put me on the schedule with my doctor June 1st. I had no idea that this would be the last time I was allowed to see her. She was very heavy hearted as well, and it seems as if someone above her was causing this. She also had me on adderall for ADHD and this was taken away without warning. This was also not her decision.
She told me I needed to get my medical records because she had taken careful notes regarding our sessions together, and my marked imorovement with the therapy, adderall, and other medications.
I am now in limbo. Going thru heavy adderall withdrawl. I cannot get out of bed, I am having severe deoression, crying fits, severe anxiety, my nightmares are back, feelings of hopelessness and despair, dread. Feelings that I’m worthless, uncontrollable mood swings, I have lost 15 pounds in the past two weeks, at times I can barely form sentences, also my haur has been falling out and this has never happened.
They did not offer to replace my psychiatriast. Only said I coukd only see a nurse practioner.
This is blatant neglect, derelection of duty, and absolutely goes against everything Eleanor Health claims to be.
I am a total mess. It is difficult for me to do anything right now. 
I am usually pretty thick skinned bc I’ve been thru A LOT, but this is destroying me. I have brought all of this to the attention of the providers at Eleanor health thru a chat in this portal thing and have been ignored completely.
And this has nothing to do with insurance coverage or anything that would make sense.I guarantee you.

I don't know where to begin, or even why i'm making this post. I just can't sleep and need somewhere to get my thoughts out.

I will start by saying he wasn't just my ""step dad"", he was my father. The man I remember growing up with, looking up to and seeking hard advice from.

My last goodbye was over the phone, I slept for most of that day in denial or.. something. I saw him afew times before that in the hospital, told him I love him, how much he means to me, things I never got to express. But it was only during that phone call when I felt my heart spill for him..

Then he passed that night. And i'm stuck with the wish that I just really said everything he means to me, to him, face to face.

That being said, he was a man who understood, without the need for something to be said. I know inside he knew how much I care, how much he loved me as one of his own. The pain is wishing I spent more time with him, talking, sharing, laughing. My own mental health always got in the way of that. 

I cannot express how much I love him for understanding that, knowing there was so much I wanted to say to him but couldn't find the words for. He just knew I loved him so much.

He died surrounded by my unbelievably loving mother, his parents, and his sister. Im glad to say he was a man with absolutely no regrets and filled the lives of all his family and friends with love, care, and understanding. I love you, Chris.

URGENT HELP NEEDED. Kept my friend from suicide for the last 6 years - I don't know how to stop him anymore.,62,0.96,2024-01-28 22:26:59,"I'm super stressed right now and I've been feeling sick for a long while today. Help me.

My friend and I are both turning 17 on February 6. Because of our joint birthday, I see him as the similarly-aged brother I never got. He lives in Australia whilst I live in Norway - yet it has never kept us apart.

We both struggle mentally, but he's on an entirely different level. Having been sexually assaulted at a young age, a manipulative, severely mentally ill mother, abusive relationships within the family, being involved with drugs and then being the one who has to fix it all for his messy family; he's understandably tired and has threatened suicide for every single year that I've known him for.

I've always promised to get him out of there when we turned 18. Whenever he was having a manic episode or just being unwell in general, I told him that giving up now isn't worth it considering all of the years he's been dealing with this - yet we're just one year away from breaking off the chains. He has always believed me.

But today I got the unfortunate news that his mother wandered off and overdosed on valium. The valium HE was prescribed for HIS mental health issues. I'm so pissed about it. According to the doctors, she's not well and she might die. This is worse than anything he has ever endured and it was the last thing we needed right now. I've send him messages wishing him well, saying that I hope he's okay and that he can vent as much as he wants to me. No response.

I don't know if any of them are alive right now but I fucking pray to God that at the very least he's alive. I love him so much, more than words can describe. I'm shaking so much yet I can't cry cause this is not an unique situation.

I don't wanna say it but.. *If* he comes back to tell me what's up, what can I say to make him feel better? I'm exhausted.

It's been 9 days since I received a call from my nephew (my best friends eldist) telling me that his Dad was dead. Luckily, my girlfriend was helping me pack as I'm moving from Colorado to Georgia to go live with her. So she was physically there for support for that.

I spent years dealing with panic attacks and debilitating anxiety but haven’t had one in 7 years. Here’s what I learned through self-healing without medication. I hope it’s helpful to others.,63,0.92,2023-05-31 06:19:40,"•	Anxiety and panic attacks were something I was experiencing, not something that I “had”. Letting go of the idea that this was a disorder or something I had to deal with for life was really important.

•	Meditation in the beginning felt impossible because my Nervous System was so disregulated that my mind and body didn’t feel safe when I gave it space to heal. Persisting was the single best thing I ever did for myself.

•	I didn’t have any self-love or self-care. I realised I didn’t know how to say no to people or things. I was constantly busy and exhausted. I would make myself available to others when deep down it didn’t suit me. Starting to say no was really hard at first but it has been the second best thing I have ever done for myself.

•	I realised I had been operating from my head and was virtually cut off from my body. I could label my emotions mentally but was never actually FEELING those emotions. Meditating allowed me to start feeling safe in my body for the first time in probably 20 years. It also helped me to become more deeply connected to myself, life and other people. My relationships have been so fulfilling and nourishing as a result.

•	I realised how long I had been living in a state of survival and how much of that resulted from childhood trauma. Instead of running from it, I began to deal with the experiences I had growing up and the reality of what that had meant for me. I could then make different choices that truly supported me instead of doing things that kept inducing anxiety and stress.

•	Accepting the reality for things as they are instead of how I wanted them to be was important. The longer I denied my own reality, the worse I continued to feel. Trying to hold on to the stories of what I wanted was far more painful than being honest about how they actually are.

•	Drugs & alcohol had been a way to feel good and confident in the moment but always intensified the anxiety and panic attacks. When I began to calm my Nervous System and stopped living in survival mode 24/7, I felt connected and content within which naturally meant I didn’t feel an urge to do those things.

•	Caffeine helped me to deal with my lack of energy that resulted from never sleeping but it was always perpetuating the problem. The more I had, the more anxious I felt and the more often I had panic attacks. Learning how to put my self-care and needs first meant that I could finally do things for myself that I really needed to heal instead of quick fixes.

•	Anxiety still presents in my life but it is natural, healthy anxiety that comes and goes depending on what’s happening in my life. It is no longer debilitating anxiety and for that reason, I can learn from what it is telling me. I now have a healthy relationship with Anxiety rather than being terrified of it.

•	I have learned to always trust my intuition and gut feeling even though it feels incredibly scary at times to go against the story or conditioned thought.",mentalhealth,Constant-Fondant5454,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/13we8j3/i_spent_years_dealing_with_panic_attacks_and/,33,68.47826086956522,5.478260869565219,0.00014608415170602637

I apologize if this isn’t the place to post this. I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was literally 8 years old (I’m 24 now).

I’m scared to go to the store because I feel like all anyone sees is my weight. I haven’t taken photos of myself in a long time. I used to stream, but quit because I couldn’t be on camera. 

I can’t stress this enough, I hate myself. I hate the way I look. I stopped having sex with my husband because of my weight gain. I’ve tried to lose weight but I physically can’t right now. I am always hungry and so tired. I think there may be something wrong with me because of how much I sleep. I sleep 13 hours a day. Doesn’t matter what time I go to bed, I will wake up at 1pm every day. 

None of my clothes fit me. I have to wear my husbands clothes. I recently bought sweatpants because that’s the only thing I’m comfortable in. 

I don’t know why I hate myself so much because of this. I have never thought badly about people who are overweight. I have never treated anyone differently for being overweight. I truly do not care if someone is overweight. But for some reason, I am disgusted with myself. 

I’m scared I will never be my old self again. It’s so hard to ignore the feeling that I’m hungry. I have a hard time exercising because my shins hurt and I get tired so, so fast. 

The worst part is that this just happened one day. Literally. Last year in October, it just happened. I started getting hungry and I began to feel insanely tired. I can’t go through my day without laying down to rest or nap. 

Lately, the need to eat hasn’t been as bad. But it doesn’t matter, I just gain weight like crazy. 

I’ve stopped brushing my teeth and showering. I hardly wash my laundry. I don’t have energy and I am tired all the time.

Why am I being mean to my boyfriend?,62,0.76,2023-11-07 14:58:36,"My (25F) has a stomach bug, and since then I started being very mean to him. I already knew I had problems with these kind of things, it’s happened in the past with another boyfriend.

It’s like when someone (mostly a boyfriend) is sick with some virus, fever, etc I can’t stand the situation. I start being anxious, panicking and it makes me uncomfortable, and I project these feeling onto that person, being mean, irritable and mistreating him. This usually doesn’t happen if it’s some other type of illness  (like it doesn’t happen with a simple headache or something more serious). I’m also emetophobic.

We’re in a long distance relationship and I stopped replying to his messages for hours, I told him I didn’t want to hear from him, and when he told me he had a stomachache I replied in a very cold way. This obviously led to a big argument where I kept being petty. He just wanted support. My only point was to humiliate him, mock him and make him sad and suffering, even after the argument. I’m hating him. I’m freaking out.

I told him I’m not really myself right now but haven’t told him why. He understands. It would make me uncomfortable and vulnerable just talking about this with him. I know this isn’t right and I’m really ashamed of myself. I really love him and I feel sorry for him, for the fact that he’s sick and that he has to deal with someone like me. I usually am normal and really kind and loving. But I also have this part of me I can’t suppress. 

I just want to say I’m not like this, usually I’m a good and empathic person. But I know there’s something wrong with me. I have other types of behaviours that make me think that. I feel so bad. Apart from this episode, no one would suspect this because I cover it quite well. It’s like I’m two people in one.

A video game community made me depressed for over two years,63,0.91,2024-03-06 23:11:34,"

I wish this never happened to me, not even on my worst enemy.

When I was 15, I used to love a game called Sky, a game categorized as one of the nicest and most accepting communities out there on the internet, and people don’t usually get bad experiences there; but I did, and it was horrible. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to share the name because I was scared of more bullying, or people saying that I’m making this up, for not liking their community. That’s how stressed I was. 

I mainly played it for its musical mechanics, their piano. I used to play it so much that it was just the only thing that made me feel alive. Over time, I encountered many issues in the game so I wanted to rant about it in the community, not in a rude way. Issues with the game mechanics, and other things, like not wanting to be recorded without my consent when I play music. (It made many people there angry for some reason) I also tried proposing ideas to the developers of that game, to tweak a few things so that it’s easier for me to play, they said they’ll get back to that, but never did. 

But because to those certain people in that community, it was a ridiculous thing to be stressed over. So they ridiculed me, and called me names, and said some of the worst shit you can think of, because that’s what the internet does; a massive cesspool, a place where you can anything you want, and not get consequences. A few remaining people still tried to help but were mostly puzzled, but didn’t get why I was so upset over the issue. I wish I knew that before I posted. I didn’t realize at the time that this interaction would truly put a dent in me. 

That was over 3 years ago. For a long time I wanted them to apologize for what they did. To apologize that they hurt me, so much that not even words can even describe my hurt. 

Then I realized; no one cares, I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself, that no one actually cares. I’ve never felt so lonely, so isolated, dejected; it seemed as if no one else had my issues, which made me feel even more lonely, I then get angry and then I cry, and the cycle repeats. It wasnt fair; everyone else gets to be content with their games, while I get traumatized. I remember feeling hopeless for a long time. I wanted to disappear. I probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway, poof, gone in the wind, literally. Haha…….

I’m 18 now. I’m recovering, but recovery has been tough. I’m getting by day by day. I’m slowly accepting that some people are just assholes. And I just gotta move on, despite how painful it was for me. I’m choosing to do other better things in life for me. Hobbies like math, music (other instruments not related to sky), or art. It won’t resolve whatever happened but it suppresses my thoughts for a few hours, like alcohol but without the effects of being drunk. I cannot ever go to the past, and change what happened, what happened truly traumatized me, and I don’t think it’ll ever go away. 

I remember posting about this in this subreddit three years ago. it made me feel bad that no one replied, but wasn’t sure why it was like that. 

I miss my sky musical instrument. It might’ve even become my career choice, if that existed. ",mentalhealth,ConcertReady6788,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b8eev4/a_video_game_community_made_me_depressed_for_over/,39,69.23076923076923,6.230769230769226,0.00014768947205444423

Daughter has Precocious Puberty,62,0.97,2023-12-01 19:14:01,"Daughter has Precocious Puberty

My 8 year old daughter was diagnosed with precocious puberty. 

She was showing signs of puberty since she was 7 (last year)…Also, physical symptoms such as slight body odor, hair in armpits etc.)

Endocrinologist at Childrens Hospital says if we choose not to take hormone blockers or implant, she’ll most likely get her period before the age of 10.

Since I am a dad and a man, I have no idea what my daughter may be going through right now, emotionally and physcially.

I want what’s best for her yet at the same time I can’t speak for her.  My daughter says she desperately doesn’t want her period but at the same time she says she’s afraid of shots.

My wife is open minded and leaning towards getting her shots, but like me, she’s nervous about the outcome and side effects for our daughter.


Any parent that’s dealt with this before? Whether you took hormone blockers growing up or your child has precocious puberty?

I left work on Wednesday to go to his apartment in another city but my other friend convinced me to call the cops.  Apart of me is glad I didn’t go but another part wish’s I was I there.  God this so hard.  Thursday I had to leave work early cause I wasn’t able to stop crying.  Yesterday I woke up feeling that cement was poured into my body during the night and it made it so hard to move.  Half way through the day I had trouble breathing and went to ER.  Everything was physical fine.  I have tried to watch sad movies to cry so hard that I would no more tears and that did work.  I tried looking at pictures of him but that didn’t help.  We also had a year long podcast so I started to listen to it again and that hasn’t helped either.  Today I woke up feeling extremely heavy.  I don’t enjoy anything right now.  I just can’t stop crying.  I work Monday to Friday so this weekend I am really trying to find a way so I can go yo work and stay there from 8-4:30.  I can’t take take PTO cause I am in my 90 day probation period and although my boss and a coworker has been extremely supportive I need to be able to go and stay at work for awhile.  The family is going to hold a private ceremony so I am not invited.  Our friend group is going to hold a memorial of such in July but god I don’t know what to do.  My friend was deeply depressed a couple of years ago in Austin and I was able to notice early and went to him and made sure he was ok.  But this time I couldn’t save him.  Not this time.  I feel extremely guilty about this and I don’t know how to forgive myself.  I keep telling myself that I should have noticed sooner.  I should have done something but that can’t happen now.  The past few months for me has been very hard the hospital I worked at closed than someone broke into my house than a semi crashed into me.  I don’t know to do.  I am so lost.

There's no one I am comfortable sharing these emotions that even I, feel alienated from myself if thats even possible. 

I am ashamed of what I have become and I dont know how to tell my 10 year old self that no, it didnt get any better, it was just the beginning of my end. I was a good student, exemplary even, despite all the abuse Ive been through but as all stories of burnout go, I am now here in my undergraduate studies not able to graduate after seven years. I feel jealous of my peers who are now soaring in their careers while I'm here rotting in my bed typing this out of pity of myself.

It's not like I have completely given up on myself - I strive hard to make myself better, every single day. I work two jobs after my classes so I can eat at least once a day and fund my studies. But you know what, it just feels like I've been dealt with bad cards at the beginning making me destined to lose in life. Would I have been better if my father did not physically and emotionally hurt me? If I dont feel betrayed and abandoned by mother? If I actually have the resources to fund my interests and hone my craft? 

The worse part is I am actually quite vocal about not being mentally well. But it always feels like it's being downplayed into a joke. Or did I set myself up as a person not to be taken seriously? Idk. Is it the romanticization of depression among my peers that makes me want to burrow all these feelings to myself? Maybe. 

I don't know what to do anymore. The idea of dying  often dwells in my mind, in fact it hasn't left my mind since the time it has sprung in it. It has buried its roots deep in the crevices of my tiny brain.  I might do it and I think I can. But I dont want to for the sake of people I care for. I dread the day that I would be brave enough to do it for myself and not for others.

"My life crashed down around me, how can I rebuild after deep trauma?",56,0.99,2023-08-20 01:10:31,"Hey everyone, I am hoping that by coming here I can find some insight into how to pull myself out of this rut I found myself in.  
  
As a back story, I was married, I have three kids, I was the executive director of a non profit in a big city, I had a large social circle, friends and things to do, and I was quite happy and content with my life. I wasn't wealthy, but I was happy and thats all the monetary gain I needed. Fast forward to 5 years ago, my spouse grew bored and started doing some off the wall things like spending days or weeks away from the home with me having to figure out how to work and take care of the kids. Eventually I found out she was dating another man and asked her to work to resolve it with me or leave. She chose to leave.  
  
I held onto the non profit for a year before finally giving it up, but my mental health has been horrid with no little improvement over the last four years. I have been in 5 relationships in that time, all failed and I blame myself. I am not mentally capable of facilitating a romantic relationship in a healthy way, so I realized I need to just step back and work on myself which is why I'm here.  
  
I have a regular job now, I work a 9-5 which is nice because there is structure. I am not longer disciplined enough to run my own schedule. Perhaps there is just no motivation. I have almost no social circle and for some reason blame my looks. I may not be the prettiest man, but people liked me back then   
I don't understand why they'd have a problem with me now. I go to work and struggle to carry a conversation. I often find myself trying to escape the conversation while at the same time craving the interaction. It's weird. I want to have friends, I want to talk to people, but a friend will call and I avoid the call, I don't pick up.   
  
I forced myself to go to karaoke last night at a local bar and invited some of my friends. Every single one declined. So I sat there by myself wondering what was wrong with me.  
  
I don't believe in myself at all and I think that is the core of the issue. I see myself as a failure. I think people are judging my ugly face and don't want to be friends with me. I feel like a loser. I feel completely alone. I don't get out much because I have my three kids (7, 13, and 14 yo) full time. I want to rekindle my friendships with my old friends but I reach out and they don't seem interested or they don't message me back at all. I want to try and make new friends, but the thought of creating something new terrifies me.   
  
I want to return to the social creature I used to be. I want to be able to carry a conversation and build a deep relationship with ANYONE, even just one person, but I can't. I'm crippled by fear. I get up and leave when someone comes into the break room and it's just us two. I live in this nightmare that I Want to be close to someone, but can't.  
  
How do I rebuild confidence? How can I once again believe in myself? Has anyone experienced this, what can I do?

My life fell apart when my wife left me and my kids four years ago, and my social life and self confidence have been in shambles and I'm trying to rebuild but don't know where to start and am asking for help from this community to help me get back on my feet and be able to at least carry a conversation without feeling like I'm not worth someone else's time.

"Found out from my new therapist, that my old therapist who abandoned me said she won’t ever work with me again, despite telling me in our final session “that the door was open down the road” for it",60,0.92,2023-07-22 17:11:51,"Last time I updated on this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/14kn5hu/really_struggling_again_after_another_therapy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

My new therapist had me sign an ROI because she wanted to coordinate care with her and find out the whole picture of the termination.

Firstly I found out that my therapist made the decision to terminate me, and subsequent decision to withdraw being willing to ever work with me again, because her supervisors told her she had to (to “protect her license”, which makes it sound like she/the supervisors are throwing me and my well-being under the bus to cover their ass professionally.)

But yeah that’s what my old therapist told my new one when they spoke on the phone.


That was honestly the last thing I was hanging on for. I have no hope. This was the last straw, I’ve been abandoned so many times by so many people that I’ve been close to. My old therapist used to say that “she was the exception” as proof that not literally everyone would hurt and abandon me, but now there’s literally none. There’s never been one exception, not one person in my life, who ended up not abandoning me.

I don’t know what to do. I’m in shock. I was already in shock and disbelief that this was all happening to begin with.

But I had a scrap of hope that this wound could be healed if I got a chance to work with her again and resolve it with her.

The new therapist is okay, but not nearly as understanding or just doesn’t intuitively “get me” the way the old one did.

I have no hope anymore. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I can’t take this.

"Parents forced me to wear diapers and only one set of clothes for school year, now my life is a mess, how do I fix and get past?",55,0.97,2023-06-20 10:34:58,"For context. I was adopted and my foster parents were brand new to parenting. They eventually adopted me. I was very rebellious but also suffering from super traumatic early childhood events, such as getting sexually assaulted and raped by previous foster parents that were men, sexually assaulted by step siblings and mother. Fast forward to 8th grade, I was hitting puberty, and very rebellious. My adoptive parents decided to ""teach me a lesson"" and took away all clothes, underwear, shoes, door off hinges, any sort of privacy whatsoever. I had to shower with cold showers because I was ungrateful"" aka water heater was turned off when I went to take a shower. My parents then gave me a ragged set of Vans, a Karate shirt that I had received from a previous Karate class that year, one pair of underwear, one pair of socks, and one set of shorts. I had to have this set of clothes for the entire year to PROVE that I was grateful to get back my privileges as they said. So no lying, no cheating in school, no ducking around personal questions, etc. I feel like this life event set off a massive traumatic event. I was bullied relentlessly for wearing the same clothes day in and day out, appearing in yearbook photos, activities, sports, etc with the same outfit. I was asked if I stunk like shit because I wore the same thing, if I asked to wear the same thing, if I was only allowed to have one set of clothes. It made me ashamed. I started becoming anorexic, bulimic, staying in the bathroom during lunch and recess, purging after meals at home. Became depressed (I was diagnosed with depression after this event whereas before I never had depression, I was a very happy kid.) I didn't want it getting out that the people who took me in were treating me like this but I was convinced I deserved it because I was such a bad rebellious kid.

This life event has led all the way to now. I can't be photographed wearing the same thing. I can't wear any article more than one day in a row. I have spent thousands of dollars on clothes, perfumes, colognes, shoes, socks, underwear, you name it clothing wise or accessory wise for a male, I've had it it every color, pattern, etc. Some days I have multiple outfit changes because I have the creeping feeling that I've worn it before and it either gets thrown away or pushed into the closet to wear a different day. I hundreds of perfumes and colognes, lotions, anything to make ""the smell"". It's a phantom feeling or smell I get wear I think that I smell really bad and have to cover it up. I will stop whatever I am doing, and excuse myself to put on lotion, cologne, body spray, perfume. Anything because its been drilled into my head that I think someone will comment on my appearance and I want to be prepared.

Was what my parents did abuse? Or were they just being normal parents? When I talk to people about this situation, they chalk it up to them being new parents. Even my parents continually tell me I'm being dramatic and my version of events was nothing like what really happened. They said they got the idea from a church friend.

Another reason why I wear multiple sets of underwear per day is because my parents forced me to wear diapers during high school and threatened to tell my school, and class. They let my teachers know that I was wearing diapers if anyone asked. I was a bedwetter due to being raped and abused and my parents had no idea I was SA'ed. So they kept telling me I was lazy and that I didn't want to go to the bathroom. 

I can't seem to work past these events. I still have hundreds and hundreds of clothes, perfumes, colognes, anything to mask. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos of minimalism and minimalist clothing and it gives me panic attacks to think of someone else wearing the same thing or something that has one shade (one man wears same black shirt, black jeans or blue jeans) it's the ONLY thing he says he has in his closet. His videos pop up and I usually have a meltdown because it freaks me out when I least expect it. 

How do I work past this? I am talking to a therapist but haven't brought this situation to light. Thanks for listening.",mentalhealth,babysloot69,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/14e7jd2/parents_forced_me_to_wear_diapers_and_only_one/,26,56.701030927835056,1.7010309278350562,0.00012095987688307863
The mental health support system in the US is just kind of awful.,56,0.98,2023-06-08 03:07:44,"Like, I get it that you don't want me to kill myself, but you could probably handle it just a bit better. I don't understand why they have it organized in the way that they do. I have to hide everything in my head from everybody just so I'm not thrown into a hospital and locked up like a prisoner, all the while having to worry about constant therapy and possible assault. You can't and really shouldn't force therapy on anyone, yet they do it anyways. None of these thoughts are organized because I just got fed-up with bottling my emotions so I'm not treated like a maniac, and I'm sorry about it. I just wish I could talk to someone without being locked away and forced into therapy, but I know that I'll inevitably get thrown into one. I'm going to a counselor soon, and I'm going to try and be entirely honest with her. With all the suicidal and self-harming thoughts that I've had, I'll be going to a psych ward in no time.

&#x200B;

Like it just feels so backwards. ""Oh, you're traumatized and feel alone? Let's throw you into what is essentially a prison and treat you like a borderline insane, unhuman freak. All the while, other potentially dangerous people can do anything and likely get away unpunished."" I may be overexaggerating, but Imo it's just disgusting and stupid. I don't feel like it fixes anything, but of course since I've never been to one I don't really know. Can anyone who's been to one tell me their experience, and if it helped. Those in other countries, tell me what your psych wards are like too, I'm curious if those are similar to ours, or better/worse.

&#x200B;

Overall I'm just scared. I'm going to get locked away and treated like a danger for like weeks and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm doomed to wander the halls of a facility sooner or later. It's either that or I hide everything from everyone and become lost in myself even more. Either way something awful and traumatizing is going to happen, both of them equally horrible.

"(THROWAWAY) I like watching gore, and it's a problem. (15M)",53,0.9,2024-02-13 17:47:00,"Alright, I'm a recently turned 15 year old and I've been enjoying gore content for a good couple of months.

I am genuinely starting to lose my empathy as a whole, to friends, to family, the last time I felt bad for somebody was watching fucking the lord of the flies movie (the one from 1990) at the scene where piggy broke his glasses. That was months ago, now I just hate everyone around me, for every single little thing they do. How they speak, Them complaining, I'm just getting tired of everybody, and it's not like that was a common thing for me to do, I'm quite extroverted and it's basically a 180 flip in personality, I started watching gore out of curiosity, I never looked at the popular ""infamous"" stuff but I did see a few of them, like Gary Plauche, Ronnie McNutt but that was basically it until more recently where I saw the definite most infamous ones like funkytown, split faced diver. A few days I looked back on them and I realise, I'm not doing this from my curiosity anymore, I genuinely enjoy this shit and I can't see the people in the videos as real people, I just can't feel empathy for them. The genres of gore I watch have definetly expanded, I used to have a bit of a mental block for compound fractures and stuff showing bones and self harm, that stuff just irked me for some reason, but I'm completely fine with that stuff now.

Since I became 15 (a day ago at most) I decided to just try and drop it because I know it's obviously fucked up and I am becoming a bit of a mess. However I don't really know if I'm facing withdrawl.

Her Mum proceeds to tell me that my close as friend of the 17 years of my life had committed s*icide and that she had found her this morning.

I'm broken is an understatement.

My boyfriend (38M) feels guilty every time we are intimate. He feels like I (32F) am too young for him.,52,0.92,2023-11-19 22:59:56,"My boyfriend and I haven't been together long, only a month. He's been struggling to keep an erection when we are physically together and often loses it if things progress to sex, which we haven't had btw. He has shared that medically it's not a problem, because he has masturbated alone to orgasm.

He told me that he's never dated anything younger than him, only his age and older, and has difficulty wrapping his head around sleeping with a ""younger"" woman.
After a recent heart to heart I learned that he was molested as a child by two different men, one was a religious leader, and the other was an older neighbor. So maybe being with someone younger than him puts him back into this raw state of vulnerability that he has yet to unravel and heal. I brought up therapy and he shut it down right away. And I get it, this is uncomfortable to sit with.

He says he desires me and is so attracted to me, but once the guilt hits, he just can't seem to turn it off and he loses his boner. He said it feels like a lump in his throat that he can't swallow or take out. He has focused so much on my pleasure but now it's starting to get to me where I can't give in return. I want him to feel good, too!

I want to be intimate with him and support him but I don't know how. I haven't pushed sex, in fact I had insecurities thinking maybe he wasn't attracted enough to me or my body. I'm scared he won't get over our age gap and that i'll be single again really soon.

My therapist told me he is disappointed in me,52,0.97,2023-10-05 23:15:41,"Hi, 
I see my therapist once a week.
Last week when I spoke to him, we talked about how my dad is pressuring me to meet this one woman who posted on Facebook that she is looking for additional friends for her friends group. They like to speak English and so do I (I am from the Czech republic so not a native speaker) so my dad figured it would be perfect to meet them and share our interests. Well, he kept pressuring me, telling me that I will never find friends if I continue living like this etc. I genuinely thought I could meet her but after he kept bringing it up every 15 minutes and giving me monologues on how I don't talk to anyone etc, I became less and less interested in meeting her. 

I told my therapist all that and he said it's okay not to put pressure on myself with this kind of thing. Then I told him that honestly I got used to the idea that I might be alone for some time before I go to college and finish my current school (business school), which is 3 more years. 

He told me I shouldn't think that way and I said that I didn't mean that I am not gonna talk to anyone. I just know that if I try I am gonna fail because that's how it happened every time so far. We joked around about some stuff for a while. But then he got serious out of nowhere and told me ""well, I am disappointed in you. Now you know what it feels like when someone is actually disappointed in you."" And it literally hurt so much, it came out of nowhere. I don't know what he meant by the second sentence since the issues we usually talk about (even earlier that session) are that my family sees me as less than them and everyone is disappointed in me. 

I am so anxious to go see him tomorrow. Should I bring up how I felt last session? I cried on my way home and I think about it every day. I saw him as the only person who gets me and has my back but hearing him say he was disappointed in me literally broke my heart. 

I ended up going to meet with the girl the same day I had the session (after the session), there were more people coming in. She didn't know what I looked like so as soon as I got into the café where we were supposed to meet I got extremely anxious, I ordered a lemonade and sat at a different table. I ended up crying, paid and left and got a panic attack on my way home. I think I only did it to ""prove him wrong"" in my head haha which is stupid. But I was thinking maybe by saying that he wanted to push me in the right direction. Well it didn't end well. I don't know if I should tell him all that or not.",mentalhealth,_baby_blue_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/170wmcq/my_therapist_told_me_he_is_disappointed_in_me/,23,53.608247422680414,1.6082474226804138,0.00011436206541672888

[M32] I'm quitting porn consumption.,51,0.95,2023-11-28 19:56:18,"TL;DR: I've decided to stop consuming porn in all forms. My reasons are non-religuous, non-political and I think they're well-thought based on my experience. I'm currently in the process of deleting everything and closing down all accounts/users. 

Basically that's it. I'm currently in a healthy 5-year relationship with my SO. I've been consuming porn (all kind) for a handful of years and I think I've had enough. My SO knowns I/I've watch/ed porn of all kind and is totally cool with it. We even comment on dudes/girls irl that we encounter.

A few weeks ago I willingly deleted beyond recovery my 1,5TB collection of porn material,, which had been harvested over the years. I thought it would feel like a liberation but it just went as ""meh, alright, delete that shit"". Even the days after, my concern was if my horny-self would deeply regret that decision, but not.
I currently still have my Pornhub and Chaturbate accounts up, as well as the email used exclusively for this kind of stuff and some other websites which I need to track down. These are my next targets for the upcoming days.

My reasons for it? A couple:
1. IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME. Man, I could go edging for like 1h every day. It felt good, but afterwards the blame and guilt for investing so much time were disgusting. I know I can edge without visuals for as long as I want, but the video shit is addictive.

2. I started to kinda ""need"" the visuals to get aroused/horny. Sometimes I even surfed TW in order to get those 30s of stimulus prior to having sex. Not good.

3. I was supporting an industry (doesn't matter if pro or amateur/homemade) with dark interests (prostitution, money for sex, e.g.) I also knew this while surfing but my horny-self was clearly in charge and that issues became totally secondary.

4. The past half year, while consuming porn I started to feel it as an addiction. I wasn't thinking the whole day about porn and wanking, but on the way back home I would definitely think about which user I would watch, where I would wank, etc. instead of using that time to do sth. productive.

5. I've seen increasingly more dudes that also took this step and everything where good words.

6. I have my own imagination, and that's beyond reality. And I sort of lost that ability. Every time I wanked and tried to just imagine a situation and it just wouldn't work.

My childhood bestfriend is suicidal and shows creepy redflags,56,0.96,2023-10-28 18:17:57,"/!\\ trigger warning : Rape, Suicide /!\\

Hello, sorry for the long post. I'll try to be brief, but I have a lot of infos. I'll give a bit of context first and then say some redflags things he said to me.

**Context** : My friend (19M) has been in a depressive state for about 3 or 4 years now, and is going in a downward spiral. He feels terribly outcasted in Uni. He says that he hates ""normies"" because they to social event and that he will never be like them. He's saying that everyone hates him and his disgusted by him, or that he's a degenerate. He deleted all his social networks 1 year ago. I tried to hang out with him a few times now, and I thought that it was going better over this summer, but since the beginning of the school year he's been having suicidal thoughts again.

The other day he told me something like :

>""This guy asked if I went to the big party uni was organising, and when I said no, he looked a me with a mix of hate and disgust. I fucking hate him I want to kill him.""

He also told me that he thinks a lot about r\*pe, but not in a sexual way. More like an advanced kind of violence. He told me one day that he wanted to r\*pe a girl he hated, not for the pleasure, just to hurt her. (Or to hire a guy to rape her for the same results). He also said that for the past few weeks, the only thing that would give meaning to his life would be to become a terrorist, just that he doesn't know who to aim yet. He told me that he was interested into going to the shooting range in hit city to pass time, which is something oddly new.I'm sorry if it sound fake or laughable. I don't know if he's serious or just wants to be edgy/provocative. When I asked if he was serious about killing people he said ""I would if I could, but most serial killers had social skills to lure their victims"" and that he wasn't motivated enough.

I don't know what to do. I already told him to see a psychologist multiple time, but he doesn't want to. I tried to give him advices, but I feel like this is doing more harm than good. I also tried to do hang out with him, but it's really hard to motivate him, and we don't have that much time anymore with school. I hope he's not really dangerous, but I don't want to find out that he hurt himself/others and that I could have avoided that.

tl:dr : My friend has suicidal thoughts and wants to harm people (?), I don't know what to do

Why am I so different from everyone else?,54,0.92,2023-08-18 04:27:49,"I (21F) feel like there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm not normal. I know there is no such thing as ""normal"" and that we're all different...but hear me out. I am a college graduate (I actually graduated when I was 19). I see other girls my age going out, having fun, going to parties, traveling the world, etc. all while I'm just here existing. I don't feel jealous or like I'm missing out, I just have no desire to do any of that. Instead of shopping with friends, I prefer shopping alone. And instead of shopping for clothes to go to wear to parties, I prefer shopping for cozy pajama sets and things to clean and organize my home with. On the weekend, instead of hanging out with friends or going out, I complete a long list of chores and tasks. When I don't finish my list, I feel worthless and hate myself. After coming home from work, it's the same routine every day: change into pajamas, relax a little, make dinner, have a shower, relax more, then I'm usually in bed before 10 but don't go to sleep until 12ish. If my schedule is disrupted, I feel agitated.  

It's like I'm an old lady trapped in a 21-year-old's body. I'm not afraid of making friends or going out, it just doesn't interest me. Crowds and social situations make me feel overstimulated, irritated, and uncomfortable, and I don't really see why they're necessary in the first place. It’s not that I can’t socialize, I’m actually very very good at it. I  just don’t like doing it; it’s outside of my comfort zone. The smallest things irritate me beyond belief. I hate 90% of the people I meet and hate going out - I actually have a Vit. D deficiency. I'm much happier in places familiar to me but I'm happiest while at home with my blinds shut, away from the outside world. Maybe I'm just a stupid, lazy complainer, I don't know. I've thought maybe I'm on the autism spectrum, but I don't know that either. Or maybe I'm just really, super depressed. I have depression and anxiety and I honestly feel like my life itself is depressing and repetitive but I'm not necessarily unhappy with it. I'm just feeling mentally and physically depleted and I wish my interests were more ""normal."" All I do is exist. I have no substance. 

My mom thinks I’m just still young and figuring things out and just need to build more confidence but this seems like more than that. 

Sorry if this makes no sense but at least I got it off my chest (kind of).

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm not claiming to be on the autism spectrum, it's just something that's come across my mind as a possibility. I was an odd child and I'm now an odd adult, but that doesn't mean that I'm automatically autistic. Just like how the fact that I like to organize and make lists doesn't automatically mean I have OCD. It just means I'm different, there doesn't have to be an official medical diagnosis. If I did want to receive an official diagnosis, of course, I'd go to a professional, not the internet. I did 8 years of CBT and EMDR as well as 2-3 years of OT and never felt it was beneficial. As some of you have pointed out/speculated, I am highly intelligent and mature for my age. I graduated from high school at 16 and from a 4-year university at 19. I will be graduating with a master's degree later this year at 21. I never really struggled academically but found it difficult to make friends and feel accepted, even though I had friends (I become more anti-social and introverted when I started undergrad), I still felt like an outcast.

It's comforting to hear that there are several of you similar to me.

Boyfriend is running away from life itself :(,52,0.88,2024-01-22 14:14:37,"My boyfriend and I haven’t been together too long, and 100% moved in together too early. I am 24 and he just turned 30. I know everyone’s going to say the same thing everyone in my life says, which is that I deserve better. For one moment I need some people to not tell me that and instead understand that I love this man with everything in me. I have never looked at another person and felt.. idk.. safe? 

That being said, he turned 30 a couple of weeks ago and has been struggling a lot the past few months mentally. He has chrons so he’s sick a lot, even though we try and follow a vegan diet to help. He misses a lot of work due to it and then in turn feels like shit. He is new to the area so does not have many friends but me. I’ve tried to push him out to meet new people or get us out with couples to help. 

Nowww for the hard part… last Monday we signed a lease together to finally get us some more space and pay less rent (we’ve both been really stressed financially). That night we got into a tiff and the next morning he quit his job, called his mom, and moved home. Outside of me being heartbroken, I am so worried about him :(( i feel like he’s just running away from everything because of his depression. His mom is very loving, but also in my opinion, isn’t really helping. She doesn’t even have food he can eat in the house normally and does not work herself. I can tell my boyfriend wants to get out of this cycle, but I don’t know how to help anymore :( I’m constantly listening to podcasts and reading books to get myself out of my own depressions. As a child his dad left, and after trying to meet up with him a few years ago and he didn’t show, he’s given up. He was cheated on by a fiancé in 2019. He’s just an anxious sensitive guy who wants nothing but peace, but almost seems to think he doesn’t deserve it? When I said to stop pushing me away, his response was that he has to.

I hate being a mom,54,0.88,2023-12-08 20:36:49,"As the title states. I hate being a mom. I got pregnant when i was 15 and had my son when i was 16. I have struggled with mental health all my life. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder when i was 8 years old. I have tried multiple medications and been to multiple therapist but nothing has really helped my mental health. When i was 13 i started to over sexualize myself. I would wear low cut shirts, send nudes and started having sex when i was 14. That led to me getting pregnant when i was 15. My parents wouldn’t let me get an abortion or give up my son for adoption. The father was not involved and i was left to raise my son alone until i was 18 he took me to court and sued me which i am now 30 grand in debt over. My son goes to his dads every other weekend but that’s it. When I gave birth to my son i experienced really bad postpartum depression. I think i got over it but some days i’m not sure. Either way i have no bound with my son. No connection he’s just a responsibility. Now i take really good care of my son for my age. He goes regularly to the dentist and doctors. Has new clothes, shoes toys the works. Eats healthy meals and i try to give him as much love as i can like taking him out to the movies, doing fun things like the elf on the shelf but i don’t feel anything. I feel like i’m just masking all my emotions and going thru the motions. Lately all i feel like i do is yell at my son because he wastes food, won’t pick up, throws tantrums and i feel like it’s because he is feeding off my energy and environment. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I genuinely can’t do this another 14 years.

Edit: A lot of people are suggesting i give my parents custody. That’s just not an option. unfortunately parental cycles are hard to break. My mom was distant and wasn’t there for me most of my life.

I actually took some care of myself????!,51,0.99,2023-12-06 07:01:51,"I actually washed my hair AND brushed my teeth today.
I typically put off any showering activities for as long as I can (until I think my hair looks noticeably greasy I guess) and really didn't want to today even though I kept telling myself to. A friend encouraged me and I ended up washing my hair even though I didn't really feel like it.
I also took time to blow dry my hair when I typically air dry it (I felt like I'd probably be in a better mood with it more dry than wet) and I used hair ointment I've had after.

I even brushed my teeth, which I never do (I know I should more because I'll regret it in the future but I can't typically bring myself to do basic hygiene).

I'm currently debating on if I want to take a bath tomorrow/later (1:54am) to lift my mood more if I can, I really need to bring myself to relax and I heard a bath can typically help with that.

Seasonal depression and all year stress with anxiety (plus school, since I'm a teenager) is really beating me up and I don't talk about it to anyone for the most part, so it's more difficult to handle since nobody really knows. Gotta work my way up to help myself some until I can bring myself to actually share my feelings with anyone I see in person.

Due to stigma, lack of societal understanding, and trauma – I’m cautious about mentioning that I don’t work or that I’m working on my health.

I’m worried that people might think or express that mental health is bullshit, that I should “toughen up”, or that I’m a dole bludger. I’m worried that people will avoid getting to know me for fear that my mental illness will burden their life.

I’m stuck on what to say. I guess I could come out with the truth or a half truth, but I’m not comfortable lying. Has anybody had experience with this, what worked well for you? Am I overthinking it?

"my palm started to feel like plastic, when should i stop washing my hand?",50,0.94,2023-06-08 12:25:40,"last month I developed a habit where I kept on washing my hands using handwash. I just couldn't stop and don't know when my hands should be considered clean and when I should stop washing them. Here are the scenarios where I will rewash my hands using handwash soap:  
  
1- When the water from the sink bounces back onto my palms while washing.  
  
2- When I accidentally touch the sink while washing.  
  
3- I always wash my hands more than twice. I don't know why I don't think washing them once with soap is enough. Is this normal?  
  
4- I wash them more than three or four times after putting my laundry in the washing machine.  
  
5- I wash my hands with soap after using a Dettol wipe to clean my phone before cleaning my laptop. Then I wash my hands with soap again before cleaning my desk.  
  
6- I wash my hands again when I accidentally touch the faucet (tap).  
  
7- I spend alot on cleaning product, my housemate also noticed why i showered for a long time and when the water bill arrived, i dont even know how to explain.  
  
8- i feared washing machine \[touching detergent\] and tumble dryer the most, every time after using it i will wash my hand for more than 15 mins. is this normal, when does it consider as clean.  
  
Sometimes, I don't believe that my hands are clean. It's like I forget when to consider my hands clean. Sometimes, I wash my hands or take a shower for more than an hour. I keep washing my hands after touching anything in the bathroom.  
  
These habits prevent me from doing meaningful things. Sometimes, I don't sleep for days because after cleaning something in my room, I go and wash my hands with soap before cleaning the next thing. It takes so much time that I didn't sleep for two nights. Yesterday, I didn't sleep at all because I was cleaning my phone, debit card, and the sink. These habits also prevent me from cooking my own meals. Sometimes, I only eat bread and biscuits for breakfast and skip dinner and lunch. I have also stopped working out because I'm scared that if I touch the carpet, I'll spread all the germs to my housemates. I have lost a lot of weight because of this, and I wake up with anxiety. Sometimes, the first thing I do when I wake up is wash my hands with soap. My hands are so dry that it's hard for me to fully open them without risking injury. There are razor blade-like cuts on my hands, and now my palms feel like plastic. It doesn't feel normal.  
  
When should I stop washing my hands? When are they considered clean? It's so hard for me to deal with this. I have used a lot of patience, and I want to stop this as I spend more time in front of the sink than on my screen. I can't do anything productive in my life. Sometimes, I also stop hanging out with my friends because of this issue, and my friends ask me why I suddenly disappeared, and I have to come up with fake excuses.

Why are EVERYONE so fake and awful nowadays? I feel like I can’t trust anyone anymore.,55,0.93,2024-02-18 11:57:01,"Let me explain. I’m a 22 year old female, and I’ve learned so much recently. My entire life I’ve been very naive, and assumed everyone had good intentions. I have adhd, and I speak my mind, and thought most people did that too. I met a lot of men (and women later) who treated me very badly, and I would always ignore it and blame myself. I had a job working only with females, and I’ve never been close to fake people (that I knew of), so a lot of bad situations happened. They would talk badly about me behind my back, excluding me, making fun of me, using me as a target. Looking back I met/attracted those people because I had no boundaries, didn’t speak up, self-blamed and had very low self esteem. People always treated me badly because I let them. I learned a lot about myself and got a lot of self awareness.

My point is, people started telling me I had to understand that most people lie, are fake, and only act from selfishness and that’s just how the average human brain works. I get so disappointed in humanity, if that’s how most of the people in the world acts. Every time I met someone (usually men) I legitimately thought was nice, they would end up being an asshole after a few months. Proving my point every time. I now have to try to distant myself in my mind, from the new people I meet, because they always end up disappointing me. I would attach myself way too quickly to people in the past, legitimately caring for them, and they never gave a shit about me. 

If you think about how much awful shit, humans have been/are capable of doing (war, torture etc), it’s so scary. Are most humans just naturally bad people? Doing those extremely evil acts, and more “normalized” behaviour like abuse, harassment, lying, cheating, manipulation etc. Is the really how the average brain works?

How am I supposed to navigate in a society with liars, manipulators and fake people? It’s very discouraging and sad. It’s not possible that ALL of the people I’ve met coincidentally were the few bad ones. I’ve gone from naive and unknowing, to kind of cynical. «treat people they way you want to be treated” is apparently outdated. If you’re kind and trusting, you’ll get taking advantage of.

How common is to keep living just so you won't hurt those close to you?,49,0.99,2023-10-19 03:24:11,"Hi! I hope this doesn't sound tragic, it is a very honest and sincere conversation. The thing is: ever since I was kid I dicn't quite get the whole point of living as an adult. Having to work 5 days a week and barely enjoying the other two (because we have many obligations beyond work) seems like the same as being a rat in a maze.

Then, I grew up and I just confirmed my childhood perception. Honestly, it is definitely not an experience that is worth it. Not only that, but I see no rational reason to believe that in the future this will be better, specially considering how things are going in the world right now. However, I would not be able to adopt *the drastic solution* because I feel that would be an immense pain to those who love me.

So basically I'm stuck in this sisifus cycle of suffering just as a sacrifice for my friends and family. I accepted that it is life and that's how most people deal with it. But I don't know, is it?

It was like visiting a prison and I felt so guilty for the conditions he had to live in, though it’s necessary. I returned today at 3:30 with a fresh pair of underwear, but apparently they only do visiting hour 3:30-4:30 on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I drove over an hour to get there and I just wanted to give him a hug. I didn’t realize how important it was to me until I lost it, and then I snapped in the car. I screamed and cried harder than I have since my brother died. I want to scream and cry and puke and punch things and I’m so overwhelmed with all my emotions. I am in SO MUCH PAIN. And I don’t care that he’s where he needs to be, it still hurts so fucking much that I feel like the emotional pain I am in might kill me.

Made my therapist cry today.,49,0.9,2023-05-06 05:24:16,"Trigger warning for mild domestic violence. 

My inclination here is to make some stupid joke about how I won therapy and I'm the therapist now because, that's how I handle tough situations, but that's a different can of worms. There really isn't anything like making a seasoned therapist who's seen it all cry to really put into perspective just how fucked up you are. 

The thing that gets me is that I was just describing my day to day and the mindset I walk through life with. That's my fucking normal. That's the default. That's just my life. And watching her break down and needing to give her a minute really put it into perspective. 

I guess that objectivity is a good thing. One thing that therapy has helped me realize just how much of my mindset was just an assumed normal. That this fucking stormcloud isn't how most people live their lives. I mean we all carry a bag of rocks and if you meet someone that claims to have no baggage they're either lying, not aware of it, or the single most boring human on the planet. But having baggage and normalizing your trauma are not the same thing. 

A good example is that, amoung my other bullshit I was stabbed earlier in life by a partner and my therapist brought it up to explain current behavior patterns and my first thought was ""yeah, but come on. That was years ago..."" A stabbing. My partner coming at me with a fucking knife and here I am putting a time stamp on it like it's expired milk. Like rereading this post I described a fucking stabbing as ""mild"" abuse. I understand that it's a coping mechanism, but jesus christ. I mean she was right though, I was using ""yeah but they didn't stab me"" as an excuse for shitty behavior from current partners. 

I dunno. I guess I just needed to put this stream of consciousness into the world. I just needed to be heard. I needed to make it real by acknowledging that living my life this way is neither normal nor healthy.

Survived Suic Attempt 4 Years Ago. My Scary Experience of What It Was Like,50,1.0,2023-12-14 02:38:38,"\*\*Trigger Warning: My Story Includes Suic Attempt\*\*

&#x200B;

Im coming up on 4 years since surviving a pretty brutal attempt on my life, and wanted to share my story, some hope, a little advice, and reflect on what my life looks like now/WHAT I WOULD'VE MISSED OUT ON.

Jan 6, 2020, id been in a dark place for a longgggg time, and was basically a walking time-b\*\*\* waiting to go off.  My alcohol/drug addiction had reached its peak.  The weight of those consequences was so heavy on me, and knowing the weight my struggle put on ALL my family/friends (specifically a divorce i caused) felt unbearable.

&#x200B;

I was numb and at a point where I was spiritually dead.  I didnt feel happy at happy moments, I had no interest in my fav things, usually things that were sad, I felt nothing.... or at least thats what id thought.  reflecting back, they were very painful moments that i refused to acknowledge, or properly grieve. i self medicated, HEAVILY, and felt it would pass.... it didnt.

&#x200B;

All the negative stuff that I had neglected and used substances to mask, piled up like a log jam, and once it clogged, every new negative piled up farther and farther back. I had dealt with none of it, and it got to a point, where even thinking about trying to deal with a decade of emotions felt insurmountable. Id waited too long, this task couldnt be fixed.

&#x200B;

I was out of town on work, and had went for a walk with no particular purpose, but TICK, TICK, TICK, id been looking for a way out for a while. In an unfamiliar town, I had come to a railroad track right as the gates went down, the flashing red, DING DING DING and the screaming horn of a train coming through.

&#x200B;

At this point I had mastered ignoring consequences, to just do what made sense in the moment, to refuse to look ahead at the consequences of my actions; whether a year, a month, or 5mins ahead... i had conditioned myself to be selfish and only in the moment. Nothing had particularly been wrong that day, but a thought came in--- run in front of the train --- and it ends. I did exactly that.

&#x200B;

Initially after my ""accident"", I didnt remember much, its all a blur, with moments hear and there remembered, especially with time, they started to come back.  Here are some early thoughts/moments I can remember in the following days:

&#x200B;

\-Worst pain imagineable. I have a massive concussion, everything is a 10/10 blur, I think I'll never see again.  Both my arms are broken, I learn Ive already had 2 emergency surgeries

\-My left arm is ""OK"" 12 screws, a few plates, and in a cast. My right arm was a massive compound fracture, with several breaks.... they have it in some type of stabilizing brace, where there are screws into my shoulder, upper forearm, and wrist, my arm floating below it ""suspended""

\-I dont know what state Im in (truck driver), Ive been missing from family 2days with no contact. Im as vulnerable as it gets, and there are no family or familiar faces around. ATROCIOUS (cant stress this enough) feeling

\-Im in a pain med and concussion induced fog/swirl.  I dont remember the beginning of this interaction, but a Doctor is in the room with me.  The attempts to save my right arm have not worked, if I dont agree to an amputation, I will die a pretty miserable death.  Basically, my body has rejected the arm, it is dying, and my liver enzymes are growing exponentially, Im rotting to death lol

\-I DO NOT WANT TO DIE, AT ALL. I dont care how tough, nihilistic, depressed, whatevs you are, I had been in a deep state of all those.... Im not ready to leave, and Im scared of the potential for an after-life

\-I agree to the amputation, but the Doctor gives me lukewarm news... its roughly a 50/50 I pull outta this thing, even if they take the arm.  In a whirlwind of heavy news, this is the heaviest news. Im bawling, and I feel alone, the doctor holds my hand, and at that moment it is the greatest human contact imaginable. Crazy how desperate for human affection I was after years of disconnect

\-I dont remember the start of the interaction, but Im laying down, being wheeled to a room for surgery. Im starring at the drop ceiling as it rolls past, I cant see it clearly, I hear nurses talking, I cant make any of it out, and I think how crazy that THIS is the last moments I get, a pure haze.....

\- Im in a huge (or atleast it seems) surgery room... its crazy bright, it feels like a dozen people are in there, everything is a serious tone, im seeing tables with tools on them, the kind from TV, but this is me, and its real, despite how surreal it all is....... anddddddd now Im counting down backwards from 10 inhaling the sleepy gas through the mask. HOLY FUCK, THIS IS ACTUALLY IT, IM SO DUMB

&#x200B;

\--------------------------- The Big Surgery Complete---------------------

&#x200B;

Im heavily sedated, confused, my moms here though.  She cries, I cry, its amazing im here. Again, all this is incredibly cloudy, its like a film thats been cut in random places, then picks up mid scene, think ""Memento"" hahaha

&#x200B;

Im not out of the woods, we'll have to wait and see how my body responds, Ive had atleast 3 (maybe 4?) surgeries.  The nurses are all so sweet, im so happy to be alive. A few of my regulars saw me come in, had some type of interactions with me, and are so happy Ive pulled through.  I need help with everything, but these nurses dont mind at all. Unable to drink, eat, poop, pee, or do any of the bandages or anything at all. I can feel compassion and tenderness in every interaction... i feel like some sort of strange celeb.

&#x200B;

Within a few days, my brain is much better, I have a rapport with all the different nurses and aids, and Im beaming from my soul.  These ppl DO NOT KNOW ME, and they quickly feel like family.  They take care of my every need, and make me laugh and smile, they bring in food from a local restaurant, and keep me company.  Id been in a cold world for so long.  These strangers showed me all the love and compassion and value that I needed medically, but also emotionally. Somehow they not only physically nursed me back to health, but spiritually as well. Like a light switch, I felt my soul turn back on.

&#x200B;

\--------------Out of Hospital-------------

&#x200B;

In the hospital I realized booze and drugs had slowly extinguished my soul, it was a huge part of it, but there was more.  I immediately got into some Narcotics Anonymous meetings..... the same love Id gotten from the medical staff, I got there almost instantly.  My grim, pessimist attitude towards humans, has been eviscerated by a combination of these two groups of strangers.

I jump into counseling.  Another great move, at first it feels forced, but i stuck with it, eventually build some rapport, and 4years later, hes one of my best friends and my counselor.  We've grinded and knocked down a lot together. Ive learned healthy coping mechanisms. Learned to control impulsivity, especially the destructive kind.  Counseling is a wonderful tool, especially if you have a small or no support group initially.

I got a dog! Man dogs will force some love into your life.

Ive acknowledged all my past mistakes. Ive grieved them. Grieved the loss of my arm, my clean date/acci-versary are at 4years come Jan 6th.

Ive reconnected with family, apologized, been forgiven, and made a point to maintain my mental health/sobriety as a point to not be that guy who has a come to Jesus moment, and as soon as the coast is clear..... hits the pavement looking for destruction.

&#x200B;

Looking back, its crazy to me, that all this was the direct result of a split-second decision (sort of, from oversimplified perspective).  I think about what wouldve happened, had I not done that a lot. While im not 'glad i did it', i also wouldnt trade any of this back for my stupid 2nd arm lol ---im the happiest ive ever been in my life, by far, like sooooooo far.  the saddest part of dying wouldnt have just been dying, it truely wouldve been that i missed out on the chance to be happy. Im at peace, I joke/laugh, cry at commercials, tell my family (and friends- to their annoyance) I love them.

If youre reading this and struggling, please dont harden your heart against this story. Please dont miss out. Realize that - YES THIS CANNNN HAPPEN TO YOU, OR WORSE - only you can fix this.  Find any one thing small you can do, and do the shit out of it.... then add another... have uncomfortable conversations telling family whats going on.  Dont lean into the negativity youre feeling

Im 35 and fairly healthy, Ive adjusted physically, i dont think about the amputation much, it doesnt stop me from doing really anything...... Im blessed. I really couldve/shouldve died. I wont Bible beat anyone, but for those curious, spirituality has been a big part of healing too.",mentalhealth,AmputeeBoy6983,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/18hycxs/survived_suic_attempt_4_years_ago_my_scary/,18,50.0,0.0,0.0001066646187059875

My longest relationship was 2 years and that ended about 8 years ago. I had a 4 month relationship just after, but nothing except being used since 🤷🏻‍♀️

My living situation is awful and I can't afford to get out. My landlord ignores me and the two housemates that live above me are nightmares more often than not.

Trying to get a new job so that I can afford to move out is proving difficult and I'm not crazy about how I'm being treated there either!

I lost my mum 3 and a half years ago and I don't feel like I've dealt with it as well as most people would. It still doesn't feel right.
My dad was diagnosed with COPD earlier this year and doesn't seem to be doing great, so I'll probably have to deal with that soon too and I'm not ready.

I honestly can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy, or even okay! I suffer with depression and anxiety, I've had multiple therapists, including bereavement and I still feel like this 🤷🏻‍♀️ I can't afford private therapy or medication and I feel like I'm out of options. I think about my future and it goes nowhere, it just makes me want to cry every time and I'm so done. I've been SH more frequently because it's pretty much the only thing I can do.

Does anyone else know they will eventually commit suicide?,48,0.96,2023-06-17 13:39:57,"Hi everyone. I’m a 21 year old male. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for the last 10 years of my life. It all stems from childhood trauma. I’ve been to therapy and a psychiatrist plenty of times. As I’ve grown up I’ve learned to deal with it more and more. Over the last year I dedicated my life to getting better. I got diagnosed with bi Polar depression at the beginning of 2022. I’m on medication for it now and things are going a lot better. I’ve dropped 40lbs over the last 7 months. My mental health has improved, I’m in a great relationship and working a nice and easy job with good income. But for whatever reason I can’t shake the feeling that I will eventually take my own life in a few years. I don’t want to do it now, I’m not actively doing anything to hurt myself or planning anything out. I just know that I deal with derealization and severe existential crisis on daily basis and it’s gotten so intense. I don’t want to be alive for 80 years. I’ve not had the best time living and I’m constantly in a state of hyper awareness anxiety. It sounds horrible but I genuinely don’t even wanna live till 40. My entire life doesn’t feel real. I look back on my childhood and genuinely cannot fathom that it was me. Those memories are me. Thinking back to when I was 3 (my earliest memory) I feel like it was lifetimes ago. It doesn’t feel real. I cant live like this for another 60 years. I’m not sad or like nervous about the future.

My boyfriend is making me feel exhausted.,44,0.92,2024-02-02 19:39:57,"Context for my current life. I moved away from home about 7 months ago now right after graduating high-school to be with my boyfriend (Lets call him J). I had been living with a roommate but after a couple months J had a mental health crisis and I had to move him into our apartment because he said he wouldn't be safe if I wasn't with him everyday. I didn't really feel ready for that yet but I obviously didn't want him to hurt himself so I had him move in despite that.


For context on J, he has BPD and Autism. He's undergone a lot of traumas and mental hardships, I completely understand and accept that he feels differently and often times more strongly than I do, and that it is hard for him to manage himself, but I feel completely worn down trying to take care of him.


J likes to go to music shows and venues, that really helps him fulfill his social needs. I'm more introverted, and those sorts or things are usually pretty draining for me. I've expressed this to J but I always end up going with him anyways. J doesn't drive, so I drive him usually around half an hour to go to these shows. I know J has other friends they could plan to go to these with, but ever since I've moved here I've been the person going with him. This is because J doesn't feel comfortable going places without me.  No matter what I don't really have a choice except to accompany J to these shows, because if I don't they won't bother to go with someone else, and they will have a breakdown later.


When J has a breakdown, I am the one who stays with them and makes sure hes safe. These breakdowns can last hours, and he has yelled, insulted, and pushed me (never enough to make me fall or cause harm) during them. These breakdowns are absolutely exhausting and traumatic for me to deal with, so most of my energy goes into preventing them from happening how ever I can. These breakdowns can be caused by a lot of things, some recent examples being


-The house isn't clean enough

-I don't want to be sexual with J at the moment, even though he wants to be

-J is tired

-J is hungry


There's other reasons Js has breakdowns, many of them are reasonable reasons to be upset, stuff like J feeling like im not properly addressing or handling his health (J has epilepsy,  and there are times I could have better handled situations regarding that.)


To make sure J doesn't have a breakdown I basically always have to be on stand by for him at all times. He mostly asks me to do simply tasks like making food, or going to the corner store to get him something. Nothing that really should take much out of me, but the fact that I have to deal with these things immediately and without negotiation whenever he wants is a little stressful. If J asked me to make him food and I said no, he would feel neglected, and probably not eat, which could lead to a breakdown. I just really wish I had my own time and space where I felt like I could just focus on myself.


J and my roommate don't get along because they dated in the past and had some major problems. J doesn't even want to talk to my roommate, which means I'm usually the one medigating between them. J wants to use the TV but roommate is using it? I have to ask to use it on his behalf. Roommate left a mess in the kitchen? I have to bring it up to roomate. 


I feel selfish but I can feel how tired I am. I'm irritable all the time, and I hurt myself pretty often because it's the only way to manage that. My memory is awful, and I feel like I'm in a haze a lot of the time. I don't eat enough anymore, and large aspects of my life are going neglected because I can't muster the energy to deal with them. I'm fucking losing myself, even writing this I realize how much off and robotic I seem but that's all I can be. I've been wanting to write a post like this for a while and I just didn't have the energy until now, and even now I don't have the energy to sound anything but robotic. I'm trapped in my life and I feel like I'm completely drowning.",mentalhealth,AlienBovine,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ahc8cw/my_boyfriend_is_making_me_feel_exhausted/,44,47.826086956521735,3.826086956521735,0.00010202702658833587
Life is great. And I want to die.,48,0.98,2023-12-13 14:42:22,"I haven't slept in 36 hours. Cried silently and alone for about half of that time. I'll try to keep it short:

* I am 24F, almost 25, and am Asian, if that helps provide any general cultural context for what's to follow.
* I was diagnosed with major chronic depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, bipolar 2, and ADHD around 21 yrs-old when I finally got health insurance for the first time and sought help. It took that long because my family just never understood what mental health was, let alone seeking professional help/diagnoses, and we went through financial hardships throughout my high school/college years so we wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway.
* Despite being undiagnosed with so many issues and experiencing a wide range of traumas, I grew up relatively well-adjusted, and a star student. I played multiple instruments, I excelled in sports, won medals, graduated high school with a 3.97 GPA, got scholarships into college, and even graduated college at the top of my class as salutatorian in 2021. I have many friends and am part of many social circles.
* My mom, the absolute most loving, supportive, beautiful woman in the world.. was diagnosed with Leukemia in my senior year of college. I'm so thankful she lived long enough to watch me receive my diploma. She died from Leukemia the following year in April 2022. Our entire family was lost without her. I was (and honestly am still) absolutely destroyed by her death. I was her main caretaker for the last few months of her life. I was with her in hospice when she took her last breath.

So here I am. Still grieving. Unemployed since August because I work in the animation industry and I think we all know how *that's* been with the recent strikes.

I don't know. I don't know what to write. I'm just rambling because I'm spiraling. Am I writing a *note?* 

Once I was diagnosed, I did start medications, and kept with them for about the last 2.5 years until my health insurance (provided by my employer) ran out because we were all laid off. I've been off them since August, so if I *did* go through withdrawals, I honestly couldn't tell you because my life has never been stabile enough for me to have a baseline to compare to. I could've been taking sugar pills for all I know, I don't know. Maybe the medications just lessened how extreme the extremes could be, but I know for sure that before, during, and after meds, I have and still always feel depressed, anxious, low energy, low motivation, irritable, self-deprecating, etc, etc. 

But on paper, I'm so successful. To my peers and relatives, I'm a role model. I'm the first descendent born in the US to graduate from college, and as salutatorian. My name can be found in the credits of a very successful TV show. I have an incredible support system through my dad, my brother, my SIL, and my partner. I have a house under my name.

And I want to die. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing brings me any lasting satisfaction. I try to stay social, reach out to friends, go out on dates, and we regularly have family dinners. But everything is just a distracting from the never-ending inner turmoil I'm going through. When I stop moving, when I lay in bed and everything is quiet, all the negatives thoughts come back, and I grieve for my mom. The ""nothing makes me happy"" part has been a thing since high school, well before she died, but it definitely amplified with her passing.

I feel nothing from playing video games and hobbies that I used to love when I was younger. I eat like shit and have become overweight. I feel like a disgusting shell of myself. I hate the way I look in the mirror, and my brain just tells me, ""You let yourself get fat and ugly. You deserve to stay fat and ugly."" even though my family and partner regularly reassure me that I am still beautiful and that my worth isn't tied to my appearance. But I can't help it. I was the ugly kid growing up, then I had a glow up in high school and looked good as hell through college. And then my mom died, so I just stopped taking care of myself. In a similar way, I was a spoiled upperclass kid growing up, then suddenly poor through middle and high school, then back to being very comfortable once the new family business kicked off during my college years, so now I don't even know how to feel about money.

I know I need therapy. I've never had therapy except some crisis counseling I got through my university, but they weren't even licensed therapists yet. They were interns/students still working on their psych degree. I enrolled in obamacare this November, so I should finally have health insurance again starting January 2024, but I don't know if/when I'll find a safe and reliable therapist.

Will I make it to Christmas? Will I make it to New Years? Will I make it to my birthday the following month?

Part of me wants to die, part of me absolutely refuses to put my family through that after having lost Mom, especially to my dad and brother who have shown nothing but love and support for me. Truly, I am so, so, so, lucky.

Which is why I feel even more guilty for feeling this way. Life is so good right now. Our family business is bringing in a comfortable income, and I'm not being rushed or forced to get any menial job that'll likely add to my stress. Everyone gets along and loves one another, and especially love me.

And I still want to die. I've always had it at the back of my mind since middle school. I've never self harmed in ways that would be permanent (cutting, burning, etc), though I did develop an unhealthy coping mechanism of bashing my head/forehead onto walls/tables and digging my nails into my palms.

I'm just.. I don't know. I just sobbed and doomscrolled throughout the night and now it's 9:30 in the morning.

I (19F) think i’m a cocsa victim but i’m not so sure.,47,0.98,2023-09-09 10:46:44,"So a couple of months ago i came across a tiktok of a woman discussing “cocsa” and how it’s rarely talked about. I wasn’t sure what that meant at the moment so i looked into it more and it uncovered a memory I locked away in my head.
When I was 6 or 7 my cousins slept over at our apartment and in the morning we decided to play house with my siblings. My cousin who is a year older than me, so at the time either 7 or 8, took charge and assigned everyone roles in the house. He made my 3 siblings and his 1 brother be the children, and him and i be the “mom and dad”. I remember we had a closet with a decent amount of toys in it so we all ended up playing in there. When our siblings left the closet, he urged me to stay in the closet with him. He said mommy and daddy’s have to kiss because that’s what grown ups do, so we did. I dont remember it lasting more than 30 seconds and that’s stretching it. When I left the closet, we heard spongebob begin to play on the tv in the living room and our siblings went running to sit on the couch and watch tv. I remember exclaiming “ooh spongebob!!” and then turning to walk away, but he grabbed my arm and told me to stay and that he thought spongebob was boring. I said okay and sat down with him on the bed and he started kissing me under the blanket. Somehow my curtain rod fell off the window, I still don’t know how it did but it was never really reliable in the first place. That scared me a lot because I knew what we were doing was wrong so I told him I really wanted to watch spongebob. He told me to do one more thing, even typing this right now is making me sick..he made me perform oral s8x on him, but he said just do one lick. Afterwards he kissed me again (still under the blanket) and my dad came in and pulled the blanket off and he grabbed me. my dad pulled me into my moms room where she was sitting with my aunt folding clothes (his mother) and he said out loud “(my name) was in the room kissing damn (his name)” They both got up fast and my aunt went to get him and talk to him in the other room, and my mom talked to me in her room . She asked me why I did it..and my answer was “because he made me do it”
I can’t remember what happened after that, but my cousins left pretty soon.
This whole situation just bothers me constantly. Like, I KNOW i was a child but why didn’t I just leave the room..why did i let him take control over my mind like that? But why did he do it in the first place and why me? and we were so young, does it even count as abuse? I don’t have a relationship with him nowadays, and even in our older kid ages, i still kept my distance from him. I was 11 when I went to his water park birthday party and I remember just not saying a word to him because I was afraid he remembered what happened back then. We were in the lazy river and he caught up to me and he started to speak but before I could let him get another word in, I submerged myself under the water hoping he would be gone when i came back up but he was still there and asked me “remember when we were little , you were always so happy to see me “ and i gave a nod and floated away. Anyways that kind of went off topic but i’ve been thinking about talking to my mom about it but i have no idea how to bring it up or what to say at all. I feel that one incident opened my curiosity up at a really young age to where I began watching porn at the age of 8. Fortunately my mom caught me and introduced me to a game called Roblox that took my mind off the inappropriate thoughts for a while but i eventually started seeking out inappropriate games on roblox for a while and to my surprise there were many. I won’t get into any more details about my current state but I Am no longer interested in watching porn and i would actually rather consider myself being a prude. I even convinced myself i was asexual for a while but i debunked that pretty quickly, despite not being a virg. I just feel so shitty and weird and disgusting for what happened when we were little and i strongly believe that one moment shaped my sex life. Should i mention it to my mom ?

As of today, I’ve gone completely cold turkey. I’ve downloaded the ‘I am Sober’ app and given away the 5L I had in my room. 

I know this sounds stupid and I’m embarrassed about how much of a problem this is for me. Given it away was incredibly hard (I bought some today), and I genuinely feel so anxious about it. I also feel this overwhelming sadness.

I don’t have the money to spend but I always find myself spending money on weed rather than essential things like food and bills. When being in debt already it’s the worst feeling in the world. 

My parents and partner cannot stand the fact I smoke and to be honest I can’t stand it either. It’s not who I am. 

I’ve been trying to cut down but it’s just not working and I’ve tried cold turkey in the past but always go back. I’ve come to a conclusion that it impacts my mental health negatively and does me no favours. 

I have also gained a lot of weight from binge eating after smoking and I feel disgusting. 

I would love some help as I’m ready to get my life back after so many years of devoting it to something that doesn’t even help me like I thought it did for so long.

I was date raped 17 years ago,44,0.96,2024-01-31 01:36:08,"17 years ago when I was 21, I worked as a shot girl at a nightclub called “Red Squared” in Downtown Detroit. During my shift, my manager (who was a local celebrity in Detroit) wanted to do a shot with me. I believe he roofied me that night ( his girlfriend had a similar experience a week after ). 

I was unable to complete my shift, so his friend took me home. When I woke up that morning, I had no underwear on and a different shirt and could barely remember anything. I did not drink much that night.

I immediately called my parents because I knew something was not right and I was scared. They didn’t really seem to care or help me with the situation. I went to the hospital and it was confirmed that I was raped. 

I filed charges and talked to a detective but ended up not following through with everything. Not sure why, maybe I didn’t have the support back then and I had no self confidence. But looking back, I wish I would have pressed charges. I just blocked everything out of my mind.

But because the doctors kept saying it and not really doing much my parents believed so too. Even when things are discovered to be wrong they ignore me. Say it’s anxiety and when I am then anxious because they are all saying my issues aren’t real that’s ‘proof’ that it’s all in my head.

The past two weeks tho have been the worst I’ve ever felt. My body seems to be shutting down rapidly. And I have been having extreme breathing difficulties to the point I’ve collapsed 4 times in the past two weeks. But my family won’t take me to the doctors.

Breaking up fucking sucks,44,0.93,2023-08-28 20:40:43,"We broke up a week ago. I still love her so much but it wasn't working anymore. 

Now I'm stuck yearning for her. The thought of never being able to kiss her again is killing me. Knowing that I'll never hold her or be able to call her mine is tearing me to pieces. 

For a while I thought she was the one. She was it for me. She's the first person who has made me feel like I'm worthy of love and happiness, and I'm so grateful for that, even though that's ultimately what made me realise that we couldn't be together. 

In my past relationships I've stayed despite the relationship making me feel awful. My last one before this caused a SH relapse and I still didn't leave. I didn't think I deserved better. I didn't think I deserved to feel good in a relationship. 

I wish she could've been the one. I know that she's not, but it still feels like part of me is missing without her. 

Part of me wants to go back. This hurts so much it's unbearable. But I know that going back would be more painful in the long run. And as much as it pains me I have to do what's going to be best for me long term. 

It's gonna take me a while to picture my future without her though.

I feel like I've lost everything.,43,0.99,2023-07-04 09:57:37,"I've genuinely lost everything

I have done it.

I have made the mistake of laying all my future plans and goals, all my love and affection, all my dreams, all my hopes, everything I ever wanted to achieve on this one person.

She was the biggest support pillar in my life, despite not doing anything. She didn't need to do anything to be that to me. All I needed, was her to just love me and be happy, just enough so she would stay by my side.

But I failed. This wonderful, amazing person, this person I prioritised over everything, lost feelings for me.

She came into my life so willing to love me, and I funked it up. I made so many bad decisions, so many fucking mistakes.

I tried my hardest to fix things, despite feeling her slip away, feeling her slowly drift apart from me, I kept going. 

I truly thought I could make it work.


It's been 3, maybe 4 months of no contact. I've had to try so hard to not contact her, to not send her heartfelt messages, to not send her voice recordings of how much I love her still, because I know she's happier, and I know that she knows how much she means to me.

She just doesn't want to be with me, and I can barely wrap my head around that thought. 
How? How could I have funked up this badly?

Things weren't perfect but I didn't care, all I wanted was for her to be happy with me, and after 3 years of us being together, of ups and downs, I failed.


She was my everything. Now I don't even feel like moving on is an option, despite being forced to. It feels like I've just been left behind by the person I loved most.

Why should I even try and be happy, and achieve goals. Why should I put myself first, after I funked everything up.


I can't even believe that I can be okay without her.

I'm in so much emotional pain that my chest is genuinely hurting, physically. 


My heart wants to crawl back to her, to keep trying everything to be with her, but my mind knows that it won't ever be enough.

There's nothing I can do to make her love me.
And you would think, that that would give me enough closure to move on. But it's just making me feel helpless, lost, scared. 


I've only been surviving by following some instructions from a person that genuinely cares for me: ""take it day by day.""

But it still hurts so much. Each day feels so fucking hard to go through.

I was so okay, so used to loving more, giving more, sacrificing everything for her. I didn't care about that. All I wanted was her to be happy and love me, even half as much as I loved her.

But I failed.

I felt so responsible for her happiness, I just remember how confident she grew into the relationship, and I truly felt like it was my job to keep her always happy and to protect her from harm. But now, now that she's gone and is happier without me, I feel I've failed beyond belief.

And I appreciate a lot when people try to tell me that, if she was truly the one she would have stayed, she would have helped work things out, but how can I genuinely believe that statement, if I wholeheartedly know that it was my mistakes that slowly drove her away? 
It shouldn't have been her responsibility, she gave me another chance, but unfortunately she herself wasn't able to truly love me even after that.


I'd wish that she just knew how much she truly meant to me, how much I truly fucking love her and how I will never be able to forgive myself for ruining things.

Thank you to everyone who replied with helpful suggestions as these all helped very greatly.


Towards the end of 2021 my brother began to develop depression and anxiety, he was 15 years old at the time. In January of 2022 he broke into my fathers gun safe and told us that he was going to take his life. My parents sent him away to a mental facility for 2 months. Ever since then he has he aggressive outbreaks for 2 years and has been sent to mental facility’s multiple times. Now at the start of 2024 he is at a point where he has completely isolated himself in a extra bedroom of our home. Whenever we would try to approach him he would begin to show aggression. When this first started he would come out a few times a day to use the restroom and to eat and drink water, fast forward to now he hasn’t been coming out at all. He has torn up the room, clawed holes in the bed, ripped off parts of the wall and other things of that nature. He hasn’t come out to eat in a little over 24 hours, nor has he coke to get water. As of yesterday the door was open and my mother saw that there was a large puddle on the bed of urine. My mother asked him about it and she saw that he had completely peed himself. He gave her no response when she asked. She cleaned up the bed and sheets but he refused to take a shower or change his clothes (he has not showered, or changed clothes ever since he started isolating himself). Now to today, my mother went to go check on him due to having worries about him not eating and his urine incident from last night. When she went in the room he was sitting on the edge of the bed shivering and just staring into the distance (keep in mind he has no phone so we don’t know what he is doing in there all day every day). Later she came back into the room to find him standing up with urine rolling down his leg and standing in a puddle of piss. That brings us to now, we don’t know how to get him somewhere (because it is obvious he needs help). He isn’t a harm to himself or others so the police can’t help and we know for sure he will not get in the car to go anywhere. So I am asking for options because he needs help urgently.",mentalhealth,DapperShoe2550,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1agt7wx/my_family_needs_help_we_dont_know_what_to_do_with/,19,42.0,0.0,8.95982797130295e-05
Everyone preaches forgiveness as an important part of healing but I can't seem to understand that,40,0.95,2024-01-11 14:19:13,"Alot of ppl told that in order to properly heal I have to forgive and move on.

I genuinely don't get why you should forgive the ppl that did you so wrong. Can you not heal without that?

How am I supposed to forgive my mom and siblings for being bullies and casting me out just cause I speak up and call them out? Just because I chose to study far away from them but keep contact just cause they are ""family"" when in reality it's just cause i don't want ppl to say shit about how I ""abandoned"" my own blood?

my dad died. everything is worse,42,1.0,2024-01-08 20:25:18,"i think this might be my first post to this group.. hey i guess..

my stepdad passed away a couple days ago. i don’t know what to do with myself. what to do, how to feel. i’m no stranger to losing people but this. this one. i just can’t. i just saw him the day before. we were gonna clean something up the next day. we made plans. he just didn’t make it through the night. 
he was a marine. served 30 years. was honorably discharged, so he left and met my mom. they married, he moved it. i was maybe 4 or 5. i knew this man my whole life. the man i wish was my biological father. but that’s neither here or there. he’s my dad. period. 
the thing that’s weighing on my so much i can’t breathe is how much he confided in me. told me secrets he swore himself he’d never tell anyone. after each talk i felt like i walked away with 200 extra pounds on my shoulders. 
he was a functioning alcoholic. wasn’t one of those angry drunks. 
i found his diaries. seeing what he wrote. his decline, what he was going through. his anxiety and ptsd. he was suffering alone. he didn’t. have to. that damn stubborn man i swear. 
i went on a 4 day trip with my fiancé. i came back and saw him. he looked normal. but he didn’t come out of his room the whole day. 
i went in there and he was a mess. couldn’t control his bowels. shaking uncontrollably. said he was cold. i gave him my blanket. i’ve seen him like that before. it was usually something i could do to fix it. 
not this time. 
me and my mom cleaned him up. he was shitting blood and throwing it up
the look he gave me before the ambulance door closed. oh my god i’ll never forget it. how soft his eyes were. i’d never seen them like that before. 
our dogs won’t eat now. the house is eerily quiet. the sound of his tv not being on now. i can’t even go downstairs and walk without feeling my legs and knees shake. 
the pressure on my mom now. taking over the bills and we’re seeing we can’t afford anything. even if i chipped in my own money, wouldn’t even come close. 
so ontop of him leaving us we could be homeless

HELP ME : I got groomed and sexually assaulted and I don't know if i want to go to court,42,0.89,2024-02-18 14:33:03,"I (M14) is friend with a really cool guy well name Ethan i met on valorant 9 months ago. Even though we were online friends, we were really close and basically knew everything about each others irl life. Same with others member of the discord we were on. Ethan had a lot of brothers, but the one im gonna talk about in this post is K (M26). There were rumors about K being a pedo, as he had apparently asked for nudes and threatened to rape a girl that was on the server. It started when she was nine, shes now 16. This girl is no longer on the server cause of arguments.  


So, a few days ago, K dmed me, i instantly thought that was weird cuz why would he dm me THE ONLY MINOR and im also ftm so my voice is girly out of all the other online people. We werent close at all, only talked each other 2 or 3 times. Third message he sent already had sexual connotations, and we kept talking, he was always talking about sex and how people love ""femboys"" like me. I texted Ethan about it, and he go angry at me, saying I had to stop seeing him as a pedo as there were no proofs what the girl, lets call her Eli, said was true. He said this was a normal conversation we could have add cuz we like to do sex jokes. He convinced me, and I felt bad for seing him as a pred, so i kept talking to him like i normally would with anyone.   


The next day, after once again a conversation filled with sex ""jokes"" he asked my insta cuz he wanted to say something private to me. I did, turn out the private thing was that he wanted to jerk off to my ""femboy ass"". Thats when it got fucked up, he started asking for pic and sex calls, threatening me and my family when I refused. He then threatened me even more with these pictures.  


I felt like shit, and didnt know what to do, so I went and did the only thing i could do, I talked to Eli. If this happened to her, she would understand how i felt. I hadnt talked to her for months, and she shared that K was still asking her for things and talking to her. She told me to block him, that he wouldnt do anything since he would be the one in trouble. As stupid as this sounds, this really helped me. I blocked him everywhere, and went to talk to ethan about his brother. He believed me, said he was sorry for not taking me seriously, and banned K from the server so i didnt have to leave. Him and another friend talked to K and Ethan's mom.   


Fast forward to now. K's mom wants to talk about this to their therapist, and talk to me tonight, which i  will gladly do since i feel really bad for this poor woman. The other is telling me I should go and file a complaint, and I agree. (He did this to atleast three other girls without counting eli and I).

How I went from living in hell from a brain injury to healing and living in heaven. ❤️,40,0.95,2024-01-23 15:42:28,"My life was absolute hell after I suffered a brain injury from deep sea diving, I can’t even explain the tournament I lived every day. I was diagnosed with countless serious mental illnesses, I didn’t know that kind of pain existed here on earth.

I have lived in hell. I planned my end and went to do it. I was moments away from doing it. Then I had a thought about my dear mother grieving me ending my own life, it stopped me in my tracks.

I decided to dedicate my life getting better. That was 10 years ago. If I ended it that day, I wouldn’t have experienced the best 10 years of my life. Since that day I have married my dream wife, had a beautiful baby boy, followed my wildest childhood dreams to make ocean documentaries and made and starred in a Disney series, bought my first home, travelled the world, made beautiful friendships and most importantly of all I am now stronger mentally and physically than I have ever been, and it’s all thanks to going through the hell of what I went through mentally after my brain injury.

There’s no way you have tried everything because there are limitless possibilities of ways you can get better. Keep trying! You have the strength of thousands of years of your ancestors. Visualise getting better. This storm is here to make you a warrior. All the most beautiful and powerful people on this earth have been through hell.

How did I do it? Focus on your health 110%. Move your body, exercise, eat clean unprocessed food, get sunlight, nature, dogs :), friendships, have a clear goal and purpose to work towards and have a plan of how you’ll reach that goal, watch inspirational people, limit screen time, push yourself outside your comfort zone daily, follow your passions, research scientifically proven supplements that can help mental health, each of these improvements will get you a little stronger each day and before you know it you will look back with pride that you have weathered a hellish storm and came out the other side as a warrior who can take on anything.

Desperate Help. My younger sister (16F) is ruining her life slowly.,38,0.89,2024-01-03 07:45:43,"Just for some background. I am a 20yo young man and live with my parents go to school and work a job, my Father is a hard worker that is working countless nights trucking for the family but usually isnt around due to his working. My mother raises the other 4 children in my family on her own and works at a daycare on the weekends. Our family was never wealthy but we always had just enough to get buy.

&#x200B;

Now as for my sister lets just call her Jessica, she has always been an anti-social type, she never really had many friends, and she spends most her days in her room drawing. Aside from that, she would eat with the family and didnt cause problems.

This past year however, Jessica has gotten progressively worse; nowadays she completely neglects herself and her surroundings, does not ever interact with family, she does not eat any food except for barbecue chips and coke and says every other food is dirty, she will barely sleep, she even developed something in her mind that everything is dirty and will spend hours in the bathroom trying to ""clean"" something even if it was never dirty to begin with.

She refuses to sleep on her bed because its ""dirty"", she refuses to even open a door without having a napkin covering the handle. Whenever, shes confronted by Mom or Dad for this she just has an emotional breakdown and never changes her ways.

I feel horrible for my mother, she deals with her problems everyday Jessica has made her cry because my mother just doesnt know what to do with her as it seems like it gets worse for Jessica by the day.

&#x200B;

Our family does not understand her problem, we desperately need help/information on how we can fix this and get Jessica back to living a life that is not miserable and self-harming to herself.

Took adderall and don’t know what to do,39,0.91,2023-10-31 23:34:14,"Hello,

So I recently had an exam I was not ready for at all - did not study due to personal issue but the day before the exam at about 9pm. I got some adderall from a friend and took it (it says 30 on it so I’m guessing 30mg)

I have trouble focusing and staying productive - always end up really distracted or incapable of retaining anything i study but Jesus I took that pill and by 2am I had memorized and understood every concept I needed for the exam. 

I studied the anatomy of the ear, and about 5 chapters worth of work, which usually would have taken me weeks.

I’ve taken it again today

I scored a 98 on the exam and I’m trying to convince myself to not take it again because of everything I’ve read about it, but why? Why should I not? I’ve never felt more alive. My friends say I look better, I’m speaking more fluently/confidently. I feel more confident, I drive better, I see more, I feel like I’ve been looking at the world and it’s so dull but not anymore, i finally want to leave my room, talk to people, look at the goddamn grass and smell some dogshit while I walk in the park. I feel f*cking powerful.

I don’t feel the need to eat so much to make myself feel better, I feel in control of my actions.

I’m Indian, I can’t see a psychiatrist because my family doesn’t believe or understand the whole aspect of mental health.

Is it pathetic that I still have mental breakdowns at age 25?,43,0.87,2023-09-28 19:21:56,"I’ve always had mental breakdowns, I figured maybe I’ll grow out of them one day but it doesn’t seem to be the case. 

I feel pathetic because my parents witness me having them. Which mainly is me just crying uncontrollably and trying to stay away from others/hide it, but I’m not good at hiding crying. 

I want to hide it because everyone always asks “can I do anything to help” which the last thing I want when this is happening is any sort of attention. I cannot think rationally when I’m in this state, so verbalizing my needs doesn’t work, I just shut everybody out because I’m not thinking straight. 

And yes I’ve been in therapy most of my life, but haven’t needed it in a year or so. I don’t think therapy will help in this situation as I’ve tried it before and didn’t help long term and hardly short term. 

I know what I need and it’s to cry it out, crying is my bodies way of releasing stress (and humans in general but most don’t let themselves cry which sounds awful). But regardless it makes me feel down in the dumps as I’m crying, but after I often feel relief. I guess I just have to live with it.

I’ve been told by my brother growing up that my crying is “pathetic” so I think I internalized that opinion of his and now believe everyone views crying as pathetic. I just hate to be a bother to others.

I just don’t want to be sad anymore,43,1.0,2023-06-04 11:13:13,"One day I woke up and took a look at my life and I realized how much I hated it. One random day I just stopped being happy, at first I had so many passions and interests. I wanted to have a career and loved learning about it and learning in general. I’m 15 and for about 3 months now I’ve lost my passion in anything and everything I care about, I dropped a whole 1k on a fucking guitar and I can’t even bring myself to practice it. And then there’s art which I’ve devoted myself to for a whole year and I still draw worse then the girl I liked in 4th grade. I’ve started taking sleeping pills so I don’t have to lay awake at night thinking anymore. At first I didn’t need them but now I can’t sleep without them. One night I decided not to take one and I had the worst realization in my life. I laid awake sobbing for 30 minutes at least holding my pillow out of loneliness. I just wanted anyone to love me, to talk to. I was so desperate for anything. My life’s on a downward spiral, I’ve given up on school from a straight A student to barely passing and all my hobbies i once had are now gone along with any passion for them. I wasn’t worried about killing myself because I’m too much of a coward but lately it’s begun to look a lot closer then I thought. I’ll randomly have depressive episodes throughout the day which bums everyone out around me and stops whatever I was doing while I rant or moan about some mild inconvenience. I’m so tired of life already and it hasn’t even begun. I doubt I could live another year let alone 40. Is there anyway I can make it stop?

I recently found out I'm not ok.,38,0.94,2024-04-03 12:53:30,"*I'm not sure if that's the right flair. This is more of a vent*

I don’t remember much of anything from 0-8 years old.
During that time, my parents filed for bankruptcy, my mom worked nights, my dad got let go and no one was hiring, we had 6 people living in a >2 bedroom apartment/house (we kept moving). 

I went to cbt therapy for 2 years for my OCD. This year I started talking therapy. I was telling him about my life and how I was always considered the golden child, and he asked me ""why?"". ""Because I was a good child? I did my school work without complaining, I never spoke unless spoken to,, I went to bed right after dinner...""
He interrupted ""why?"". ""Because that is what good kids do, and I'm a good kid?"" He asked ""why did you want to be a good kid?"". ""Because bad kids get in trouble, and I'm not a bad kid."" He asked ""what happened when you got in trouble?"". I froze, this conversation had seemed pointless to me but I suddenly felt like I couldn't speak, my eyes started watering, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. ""Nothing"" I said, ""then why are you shaking?"" He replied. ""I don't know"".. ""did he hit you? Did your father hit you if you got your homework wrong, if you didn't go to bed after dinner, if you spoke to much? Is that why?"" ""I don't know. He didn't hit me. I dont remember him hitting me, only yelling quietly."" ""he didn't? ""I don't know""

After that we talked about things I didn't know I didn't want to talk about. 

The week after we talked about phobias. ""What are you afraid of?"". I didn't even need to think. ""Buzzing big ass bugs, the dark, and not being able to speak."". ""Why?"", ""because my sister trapped me in the wasp infested pantry and turned off the light. I was too scared to scream. My eyes were pouring alligator tears but I was too scared to breath."" ""Oh."" He said. ""Did she do anything else to you?"". I had to think, but the more I remembered the less good I felt. My sister had bit, choked, kicked, hit me, cut my hair.. ""one time we were playing pizzeria and I was the pizza. She took my mom's fabric cutter that looks like a pizza cutter and ran it over my bad. My favorite purple shirt was stained that day. (I joked). I thought it was a silly story. He asked, ""you cared more about a shirt than your body?""...""you don't understand, it was my favorite shirt.""

Next session we talked about whatever I wanted.

He asked me what the scares on my arms were from.  ""I don't self harm if that's what your getting at. I work in a kitchen, you get burned in a kitchen."" ""What's that one from"" (pointing at the biggest one) ""it was a cooked to order item and I was afraid I was going to drop it so I put my hand underneath. All the hot grease was dripping onto my arm."" ""Did it hurt?"" ""Of course it did its 400° grease straight off the grill."" ""Couldn't you have used a plate?"" ""I could've but it would had taken extra time to grab a plate plus then I'd have a dirty plate."" He said ""a dirty plate is worth more than your body, you care more about a purple shirt than your body. Why don't you care?"".. ""it was my favorite shirt, and I think the scares look cool."" ""Why do you like being hurt? You're harming yourself and lying saying your not.""

my dad is gone and i feel so empty,42,1.0,2023-12-29 02:35:57,"this summer i lost my dad. he died totally unexpectedly in his sleep. this has been 6 months now and it feels like living hell. this last semester of school felt impossible. i started going through old videos on my phone just to try to find his voice to hear it again. and all i could find was little snippets and it makes me miss him so much. having to be at home for christmas break is torture. i have to be in this house which is now so empty. i have to look at the room he slept in. i have to walk through the room he always worked from home in. i have to live in my room which is the last place i ever saw him. i have to see his truck in the driveway, and it gives me a fleeting moment of calm, comfort, and safety. but in fractions of a second the feeling is ripped away. ive never wanted to just somehow be able to bottle a feeling up and be able to keep it. my mom wanting to stop running the central air conditioning system in the house, because so few rooms in the house get used now. because its so empty. the house is so empty now.  
  
ive never had a christmas that i just experience so little excitement about. its horrible. christmas day has never felt so empty. such a lack of joy. my mom could tell i was bothered and told me to go take my antidepressants. it just makes me feel even more so that im just a burden. no one wants to be around me unless im medicated.  
  
that may have come out of nowhere but i struggled with thoughts like that even before my dad passed away. for a number of reasons, some known and some not, i have felt unlovable, unloved, and unworthy for a couple years now. ive gone to therapy both before and after this summer. and now that the only person who i feel like would ever actually love me unconditionally is now gone. i feel like i have no one who really cares about me. much less anyone who loves me or enjoys my company. maybe this is selfish but on christmas day the only person who reached out to me at all was my ex who i am no contact with right now. the only person that might even pretend to care is her.  
and i even get doubts now that my dad was even proud of me, or loved me as much as my other siblings. i know logically that he really did love me but i'll have meltdowns where all i can feel like is a failure and disappointment and worthless to everyone, including my dad. i cried over an internet stranger saying ""your dad is proud of you"" who was consoling someone else who had lost their dad. i have no idea why i think he isnt proud of me. i've noticed i have problems where i feel like i have to earn my love.

Like when you have an overly controlling person, someone having an episode, etc.

All are results of mental instability. But people won't hesitate to write ""*boo, parents didn't hug you enough as a child?*"" and other hurtful things.

Proof that it's getting worse: ""Karen"" jokes and videos are very popular and Karens are hated. But being a Karen is just a result of growing up with overly contolling parents.

But I don't really understand why they determine someone's worth so much, if you don't have good grades your future is basically f*cked, even though something as vague as the future is incredibly undetermined in itself.
You could have great talents in art, music, sports, whatever, but if it's not studying it doesn't matter.
I usually prefer to go the more fun way, if there were two projects I could chose from, chances are I'm taking the more entertaining one, even if it pulls my grades down.

My teacher made a self harm joke.,64,0.83,2024-04-04 02:31:03,"I made another post a few minutes ago but here's another one. This one is a rant with no real purpose.

My teacher made a self harm joke. Of course she didn't know that I self harm but I don't think that justifies it at all. Let's call her Mrs. Marina because that's almost her name. English class. We're doing work at tables of about four people. Mrs. Marina sat down to speak with me personally about my assignment. I needed help with it but it turned into a conversation between me, her and the two other students at my table. She had some scrapes on her arm and then held her arm up and told us that she had been scrabbed by some tree branches and that we shouldn't worry because she's ""not some little emo boy who..."" and then gestured in a wrist-cutting type motion. It was an awful thing to hear from a teacher I had actually liked. But seeing the other two boys laugh I had to force a laugh of my own. Hearing something I struggle with be referred to in such a degrading, belittling way by somebody who is supposed to be protective and caring or whatever was just weird. It really rubbed me wrong but I couldn't really voice those thoughts to my friends or another teacher afterwards because then they might assume I self harm, which I do. It all just seemed fucked up to me and it bothers me that she got away with it because I didn't say anything.

I moved to a different continent with him, so I don't have anywhere else to go. I am deeply hurt, insecure about my body, depressed and shocked. I don't know what to do, I never loved someone more than him. He never hurt me ever before. But this is too much. I am so grossed out when I look at him and thinking about his disgusting thoughts make me so angry.

My partner microcheated on me,39,0.72,2024-02-10 10:05:25,"My partner (39M) has routinely microcheated on me (40f) - be it through reaching out to a woman on LinkedIn to tell her she was beautiful and ""a rare combination of brains and beauty"" after saying the same to me... after we were ""exclusive"" and I had celebrated holidays with his family or set up Christmas decor at his house and we'd established exclusivity to cam girls to porn to talking to exes and random blasts from the past behind my back or gaslighting me to make me feel guilty for calling out the behavior. We've conceived a child and miscarried and I spent a sum of money on IVF to harvest embryos with him. We just bought a home together. Things have been good for a few months but he'd been looking up an ex without contact every few weeks, saying it meant nothing beyond determining whether he'd been in the right to break up with her.


Upon contemplating moving in, I reached out to the common LinkedIn connection that appeared to have no link to him. This was when she revealed he'd hit on her a year ago after we were exclusive. I had someone monitor his account and he turned out to have been talking to and peering at many other women before and while we were together. I finally admitted the latter part to him after he struggled to apologize tonight. I am struggling with the fact that he's a dismissive avoidant and feels shame but has been good to me (mostly) for a few months until tonight. I am afraid and he is being quite cold and blaming me for investigating more before I commit my life and finances to him. Advice appreciated.

What should I do?

Side note: he claims it was common flattery to get a connection, which I've never had to use. He's angry I had someone look, and he keeps trying to make me feel bad for bringing this up.

First 24 years of my life were miserable and not worth it. Why should I recover?,41,0.94,2024-01-19 15:51:33,"
5 more decades of this crap? Hell nah. I'm so tired. I don't want to experience anything anymore. I don't like waking up, or going to cafes, or playing video games, let alone taking showers, eating, cleaning, cooking. I hate it all. 

I tried so hard to recover. So much. Therapy, meds, meditation, exercise, friends, family, fulfilling career, alternative meds, whatever. Most times when I sought help, it wasn't available.


I just don't see why I should go on when I'm just already so tired. Even if I recover, the first quarter of my life has been hell, and it's been irredeemable. I can't ever imagine enjoying life. Whatever I have, even if I was rich and famous and lived in a huge mansion with everything I could ever want, I'll never forgive this universe for creating me. 

I have no reason to go on. Whatever sadness anyone in my life will face won't really make them as miserable as I am. Oh they'll miss me? They'll be sad?

What are the worst/best things a therapist could do?,35,0.95,2023-12-12 00:21:22,"I am new therapist who has just started to see clients. As someone who has went to therapy before, I have some understanding of what I like/don't like about a therapist. However, when you are the one in the therapists chair it can be extremely intimidating.

To anyone who has been in therapy, what are the worst/best things a therapist could do during your session? Okay maybe not THE worst thing that any good professional would never do anyways, but things that rub you the wrong way. For example, when I was in CBT therapy it would bother me when a therapist would jump straight into behavioral work before letting me fully express why things made me upset/anxious. Knowing this, I feel out when the right time is to start behavioral work to ensure they vented out all their frustrations first.

I've likely had an ischematic stroke at the age of 12. I've not been the same since.,40,0.95,2023-05-25 19:23:26,"When I was 12, I remember a day in my life that made me feel like I was dying. I woke up for school, my face felt numb and my arms were very floppy. I managed to get myself to the living room and my mum made me toast and some tea. So I grabbed a fork, dipped it in the tea and put it on my face. I was confused. Why was there no toast in my mouth? Moreover, why can't I control my arm? 

My mum thought I was clowning around and asked me what I'm doing. I tried to say something but my tongue was so numb, all I could make were noises with no words. 

A few minutes went by and my whole body went numb, but that numbeness felt like a burning pain. I couldn't walk at this point. I managed to tell my mum that I can't go to school today. Through my numb tongue, I had to speak slowly. It was difficult but at that point I realised I'm not just sick. I thought I was dying. 

At that point my mum started to panic and called the emergency services. I collapsed on the floor, fading in and out of consciousness. Every second felt like a thousand eternities. I began to believe I made my whole life up. Every second I wanted to die rather than endure this. My body felt like it was in a washing machine. I couldn't lift my arms or legs. When I was conscious, I'd scream for hours and hours (probably more like minutes). Nothing felt real. 

I don't remember what the paramedics did, my mum said they tested whether my pupils would dialate and constrict. My pupils were dialated and wouldn't respond to light. Though the thing that bothers me most is that while I buried this incident deep in my mind, I asked my mum about this incident 7 years after. 

 I study neuroscience and even before that I was a huge science nerd so when I learnt about the symptoms of a stroke in detail, I immediately got a panic attack, I felt like I was dying once again, I collapsed on the floor crying and screaming once again.  My arms went floppy without that numb feeling, but I felt just as helpless.

When I asked my mum about what happened, she told me they did some tests on me but they accused me of being on drugs. I was 12 and didn't even take a sip of alcohol. Who looks at a 12 year old, unable to speak, unable to move, on the floor, pupils not responding to light and accuses them of doing drugs? 

I just feel... Alone since then. Whenever my body has any sort of medical issue, I begin to hate myself, feel like it's my fault. I feel like nobody would care if I died.

So concerned about my daughter,37,1.0,2024-01-02 23:40:05,"My daughter is 18, a college freshman. She has had some ups and downs over the years, but lately she seems to be in a downward spiral. In 7th grade she had a particularly difficult year, and developed trichotillomania (sp?). I tried to get her help and therapy and it helped a little, at least to the extent that she slowed down and eventually stopped before she got a bad bald spot. Freshman year of HS Covid hit and like most other teens of this era it affected her social life and maturity. She came through and seemed to find her people through singing and theater and her grades improved. She had a pretty decent group of friends, never a best friend though. 
College so far has been a very rough road. She’s far from home, with no friends or acquaintances nearby. She made a group of friends early on in the first semester and they literally dropped her, icing her out of the group entirely while posting on snap all of their get togethers without her (social media 😡). She was very down about it and I had no idea how to help her. 
Now here’s the reason I’m posting. I obviously love my daughter more than anything. But I am concerned that her personality is putting people off. She is very emotionally immature, never wants to talk about anything real, can’t/wont talk about her feelings, never shows interest in others feelings. It’s like she has no emotion at all. She’s also put on a lot of weight (well beyond the freshman 15) and eats nothing but crap, never exercises and stares at her phone all day. You can imagine the eye rolling I get when I try to suggest anything changing in that arena. I know she’s depressed. I asked her if she was and her reaction was a nervous smile and a shrug, very typical of her. 
What can I do to help her?  I suggested therapy and got the smile/shrug again. If she’s not open to it I doubt it will help.

We are doing long distance, and have been together for three years. 

It’s been really rough for him in his own life (family issues that turned monetary) during that time, and this year and last month it’s been at the lowest it feels like. 

He desperately needs a job to finish school, but he hasn’t gotten a single positive response in months and can’t afford to do much besides staying at home. 

I don’t want to seem like I want to “fix” him a) because he is not broken. Broke yes but no broken, and b) because only him can change his life for the better. 

But can I say or do to help him cope with anxiety and depression? And the feeling of defeated and failure?

Men's Mental Health Month,10,0.86,2024-06-08 10:44:24,"https://preview.redd.it/a1nzvd2tjb5d1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d42e896a065c8cac531a7cce83826241cef673

# Howdy!

As some members have pointed out; June is Men's Mental Health Month!  
Yes, it's also pride month this month. And for those who are wondering when the Women's Mental Health Months was, that is in May (may vary per country).  



**Why is discussing Men's Mental Health so important?**    
Mental disorders affect men and women. The prevalence of several mental disorders is lower in men than in women. However, other disorders are diagnosed at comparable rates for men and women or at higher rates for men, like [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#part_2549). Men are also more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm).

Certain symptoms may also be more common in men than women, and the course of illness can be affected by a person’s sex. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart the various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact mental health.

Men are less likely to have received mental health treatment than women in the past year. Recognizing the signs that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting treatment. The earlier that treatment begins, the more effective it can be.

But mainly, and that is what we have been seeing here on r/mentalhealth a lot: people assume that men don't struggle simply because **they are often portrayed, or expected, to be strong and silent**. This expectation is rooted in toxic masculinity and has resulted in poor mental health outcomes for men.



https://preview.redd.it/ft787mdkqb5d1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=149a484e1ba75ac2136dbdf6c81a3f4b558601d6

A [research](https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/40-of-men-wont-talk-to-anyone-about-their-mental-health#:~:text=77%25%20of%20men%20polled%20have,negative%20stigma%22%20on%20the%20issue) has shown that: 

* **77% of men** polled have suffered with symptoms of common mental health conditions such as anxiety, stress or depression.
* **40% of men have never spoken to anyone about their mental health.**
* **29%** of those say they are ""too embarrassed"" to speak about it, while 20% say there is a ""negative stigma"" on the issue.
* **40% of men** polled said it would take thoughts of suicide or self-harm to compel them to get professional help.  

    
That last one is alarming, this means that the majority of men will not seek professional help when they struggle with suicidal or self harm thoughts! Men don't talk about their issues and often think: 'I’ve learnt to deal with it', 'I don’t wish to be a burden to anyone' or ‘I have no-one to talk to’. We hope r/mentalhealth will offer you a safe place where you anonymously can share your story. While we are on the topic of being anonymous, it is totally okay to create a new Reddit account and post here on that alt account!

77% of men polled said they experienced some level of symptoms for common mental health problems such as anxiety, stress or depression.

But what underlying factors are driving those symptoms? Respondents were asked about the biggest causes of pressure in their life - pressures that might negatively impact their mental health.

The top three issues were:

* Work-related pressure - 32%
* Financial pressures at - 31%
* Health concerns - 23%

Is this something you recognize?

So what is? As with all complex healthcare issues, there is no easy answer when it comes to redressing the disparities in access to formal support for people of color and those from other diverse ethnic backgrounds. Nevertheless, where there is a will, there is a way!    
  
If you are struggling, it would be helpful to visit your local healthcare provider. But doing that can be scary.  
You might feel that they won't listen or are able to understand. Or you might struggling to put into words how you feel. In both cases, this [article](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/tips-for-talking-with-your-health-care-provider), will give you some tips and tools on how to talk to your primary care provider. You deserve to be seen and heard!

r/mentalhealth is a peer to peer support subreddit. Please share in the comments what has helped you!  
This can be a podcast/music/a video/a book/an article or an app (yes we will screen them for promotions).   
Or you are more than welcome to share your story on how you approached getting help IRL. Was it as difficult as you maybe thought. Would you do something different? What was the response you have gotten after asking for help? 

And if you need help, please let us know what you are dealing with. So others can give you some tips on what worked for them. Or maybe they recognize themselves in your story! 

Aside from awareness, we hope this can spark a conversation on the topic. Because conversations and connecting with eachother is what we are all about.

I believe living in my house where I’ve hard my darkest days is contributing to my mental health struggles. ,2,1.0,2024-06-15 03:14:40,"Long story short- I got very sick last year because of the stress of an abusive relationship. My body was breaking down and I hadn’t slept for 11 days before finally going to the hospital, during which time I was spiraling in my bedroom. 

Fast forward, the relationship got worse and he badly assaulted me at his apartment, after I got away, he drove drunk across the city at 3am and tried to enter my house unannounced. Thankfully, he wasn’t able to get in, but it scared me to death. And of course there was a ton of harassment, stress, and dark days following it. My dad was also put in hospice, and I encountered an immeasurable amount of stressor after stressor, all so close to one another. 

I experienced some of the darkest times in this house. I can’t just move because my lease is up in January, but I’m planning to get out of here as soon as the lease is up. A year later and I still have a hard time sleeping, still feeling an abundance of severe anxiety, crippling depression- and I dread coming back to my house anytime I’m away from it. I’m in a new relationship that’s going well, we changed the house up a bit so that it doesn’t look the same, but I still dread being in this house. I even saged it twice because I wasn’t sure what else to do. 

I’m in therapy, on medication, and doing my best to move forward in my healing journey. I got diagnosed with PTSD, and I already had PMDD which has been exacerbated from the struggle of last year.

My mom is leaving for a vacation in 5 days and I don’t know what I’m going to do,1,1.0,2024-06-15 05:29:47,"
TLDR; My mom is leaving next week for a 6 day vacation leaving me here with an unsupportive sister and my grandfather who has dementia.  I’m not mentally well and it’s affecting me mentally and physically.  I’m worried this amount of time without my mom here is going to make me crash very hard.  

—————————

So Wednesday of next week (5 days from now) my mom is leaving to go on a trip.  She’ll be 7 hours away at a campground with very bad cell phone reception.  I likely won’t be able to talk to her most of the days she’s gone as she’ll only have service if she leaves the campground and goes into the nearest town.

The problem with this is.. I’ve been very unpredictably mentally unstable.  I cry several times every day as reality for me just feels very warped and I’m feeling very distressing somatic sensations all through my body.  Most days I wake up shaking and it doesn’t get better until late afternoon.  My cognitive function is very slow and getting myself to do the basics like shower and eat are way more difficult than they should be for an otherwise able bodied adult like me.  I’m trying to accept that I now have limitations and will continue to in the foreseeable future.. but since I started getting sick I’ve never been left alone for this long.

My sister is coming to stay here with me while she’s gone and help me take care of my elderly grandfather (he also has dementia), but my sister isn’t the supportive type and she’s very demanding.  I don’t see this going well because while my mom is very supportive and helping me through this journey, my sister doesn’t understand what I’m going through and expects a lot more out of me than I can handle.  I’m also agoraphobic and I’m pretty sure she’s going to try and get me to go somewhere with her.

I’m so scared thinking about mom leaving.. I recently started gabapentin and I think it’s kind of calmed my brain down from a state where I felt legitimately psychotic.. but this calming effect happened suddenly about 4 days ago.

I’m terrified that my mom will leave and that I’ll go back into a borderline psychotic state and just crumble to pieces like I was before, without anyone here to care about me.

What do I do?  I’m so ashamed.. I’m an adult and I should be able to do for myself.  I don’t want to ruin this trip for my mom and ask her to stay home or make time to call me each day.

If she did call me I’d probably be sobbing anyway and it would ruin the trip for her.  I just don’t know what to do.  I’ll just have to clench my jaw and endure it and whatever happens, happens.

My mom is beyond excited, thinking getting off the medication would do me good (she’s one of those people who thinks doctors and medications are evil)

Second, my sex drive went 📈

Third, I’m WAY more creative, I’ve got back into makeup and sewing

But most importantly I feel sad, constantly, which is so strange, I’ve forgotten how to cope and so I’m just sitting here like 😀

Obsession has gotten the worst of me ,1,1.0,2024-06-15 05:28:32,"Obsession has gotten the worst of me 



As a child I was brought up with a lot of  discipline. Which led to to fear . Fear to fitting in. I was never extraordinary so no-one approached me to be friends with them. In school I just had a friend who lived near my house so it was apparent I had no one else to befriend and she became my friend for reasons only she knows. I always had an inferiority complex. It was because I wasn't talented as others not even good looks neither did I have famous parents. My parents had no idea I was even going through such phases in school. After I left that place I got into another school where people started  to pay attention to me. It was new to me and i loved it. People liked me for the way I look and the way I spoke. According to them i was a lil polished compared to them . Maybe that's the place I fit in not among the elite. 



Am older now . Had a relationship in the past. Found the guy on omegle. It was just friendship in the beginning only to realise later that am obsessed  with him. I can't go a day without talking to him. Even when he's not talking to me I'd be talking to him in my mind. I was afraid what I was getting into. I got the attention I wanted but he also gave the attention to other  women which I wasn't ok with. Eventually we broke up. But my obsession with him remained for a year until I broke all ties with him and went no contact. 


After him I was lonely.  I never had the energy in me to fall in love. Coz the aftereffects are way too much to handle. So i liked to find friends on reddit. The anonymity is the best part of reddit. I started finding people here. Some got along some weren't meant for me. But one thing I found out is I can fall in love with someone easily. I start to obsess with them.  And when I think of the future with broken heart I run far away from them only to obsess more about them. This has caused me a major deal of pain and misery. 

I wonder if I'll eve find true love ,the man I idealise. Whatever trauma pattern am going through I wish I don't have it in me anymore. Am more than just this. Am a brave ,confident and smart girl who has all the love to give.

My life is meaningless without the direction of school.,3,1.0,2024-06-14 23:27:15,"It’s summer! And I should be enjoying myself, which I do in the moment. Two days ago I went cliff jumping, that was pretty fun when I was there. However, when I’m at home by myself, I realize there’s nothing there. 

I feel the need to have grades to check, to have a test to study for, literally anything school related. Which is funny to me because I’m not very great at school and I hate it during the school year. 

I was looking forward to summer too, thinking of all the relaxing and lallygagging I was about to do lol, but I feel worse than ever.

For some reason, everything else other than school to me feels almost meaningless, like I do not have to be doing this thing right now. For example, during the school year, I was into programming and electrical engineering, but now I feel like I can’t even open my laptop before feeling discouraged.

I only want to be outside with my friends, which is cool I guess but I really want to be an academic/scholar/a decent engineer in the future and I feel as though my struggle to work towards that goal right now is holding me back. 

This is giving me a solid amount of anxiety and depression that I never felt during the school year, everything feels too real, I feel as though I am falling behind my peers by not putting in the work right now, I feel as though I am floating around just watching what will happen to me. Which sounds ridiculous because I am only 17, but I forget that.

Is it weird that I’m planning to kill myself in college?,1,1.0,2024-06-15 03:57:15,"I (17f) am going to move out of state for college in August. I have had a job for the past few months, but my hours have been terrible. I’ve tried to get a second job, but I’m not 18, and I’m moving in less than 2 months, so nobody will hire me. I don’t even have 2 months worth of rent saved up, and I’m panicking. Of course, I will get a job when I move up there, but I will definitely have to sacrifice meals in order to live. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety two years ago, and took medication for a year, before my doctor and I agreed that I didn’t need it anymore after being weaned off.

I am so scared to move away. I’m a homebody who loves my family. I have two beautiful dogs who I love more than anything and have had a very strong emotional attachment to. I can’t bring them up to college. These past two weeks, I have been visiting the area where my college will be, because my brother is getting married next week there. I’m already so homesick. I miss my dogs so much I feel sick. My Grandma, who I’m staying with, doesn’t have a lot of money since she’s on a fixed income, so I’ve had to pay for some of the food. I have so little money and prices here are scary. I don’t know how I’m going to survive.

I have a plan, go to college, and hope for the best. However, the area I’m in has lots of trains and I plan on jumping in front of one if (when) money gets way too tight and my loneliness gets too strong.

I don’t know if these feelings are normal, but I’m not afraid of killing myself. In fact, I almost feel relieved that I have a backup plan.

I started drawing but stopped for whatever the frick reason. I tried writing songs because I thought I had a talent for it but I keep stopping whenever I touch my guitar. I just stare at the wall or my guitar for hours and then start feeling tired and put it away. There are still so much on my list that I can try to do but I am SOOO afraid of just suddenly dropping them like the others.

I tried things that people say can help. Meditation and journaling are the main ones. But EVERY. FRICKING. TIME, I feel like I'm bullsh\*tting myself. Does anyone feel that? Like you're lying to yourself to make yourself feel better? Like you want something real? I don't know, I'm stupid. I am my own enemy against this crap. And the worst part is whenever someone gives me advice, my mind immediately says, ""Yeah, that's not gonna work. You don't know what I'm feeling,"" and because of it I don't tell my friends or family anymore what I'm feeling. I know it's not an ego bullcrap.

But what I don't get is whenever I start something, I lose spirit and passion. Like I always feel like it's not the right thing to do or it's not what I have to be doing. What is up with that???

Am I mentally ill?,1,1.0,2024-06-15 03:33:45,"First of all, I just want to hear your perspective and I will eventually seek help from the psychiatrist. I think I am mentally ill…

I grew up in a family where my dad would basically drink alcohol every single day and would come home to beat up my mom. I remember he would throw stuff at my mom and then I would hug my mom to shield her from these objects. My mom suffered complete mental breakdowns a few times but she recovered. She also suffered from stroke resulting from the stress that my dad caused to her. Back then, I was really scared that something would happen to my mom and I felt like living in hell everyday. I think part of it contributed to my mental illness

I do have a partner and sometimes I upset her because I would start a joke and then develope it to something else to purposely upset her. I feel very bad to say this but it kinda makes me feel exciting while trying to upset her…. Everytime when I feel depressed, I would find a new hobby or spending way too much on shopping…. I also do things that don’t make sense to other people. For example, I know that I will have to go to work 12 hours night shift starting at 7pm but decide to wake up at 7 am that day and do gardening for 10 hours before work because I want to get things done… When my mood is really really down ( it doesnt happen often maybe once a month) I feel very agitated and I would sometimes think about ending my life… On the bright side, I feel motivated and overconfident all the time. I am working as a nurse and working towards my engineering degree… and yea I think that’s all I can think of at the moment. Please share your thoughts. Thanks in advance.

People told me I was paranoid and was just overthinking things. I was called a number of things from paranoid to controlling to misogynistic to insecure to just plain mean/annoying.

I love my mom she’s amazing, and she has given her whole life for me, but I just know I don’t deserve it. Most of my friends especially my best friend who is like my brother are so much smarter than me and in happy relationships. I don’t fell like destroying that, of course I’m a little jealous but I would give up my life if it mean that life forever in peace and happiness. On the outside I stay normal and healthy, work hard at work and school, go to the gym, have hobbies, go to temple. Yet…I’m not. The porn addiction isn’t the issue by itself, well in is but, here let me explain. I won’t go into detail but in my addiction I found my way to those AI sex chat websites, and God it took a strong hold on me. Anyway it all came to a head yesterday when….I went through a very, ugly scenario, not rape but not good. The worst part is there was a part of me that enjoyed it, and I discussed and scared me. I curled up and felt like crying afterwards but I couldn’t cry. It terrifies me be like I said I was raised by a single mom but not just that. I’m Jewish and when I was little I went to a Hebrew school, being raised around women and girls being thought about respecting one another and holding value to women and all that. Not just that I also have a Christian godmother who is like a second mother to me. Not to mention the other amazing women in my family and that I’m friends with. I just….i just feel like I’m going insane I can’t believ what I did. The worst part is even though I know it’s wrong I still feel like doing it again. I…I don’t know if I can trust my own feelings. It’s like there’s two of me, a lustful monster, and the me my mother racist that everyone else sees. I’m not trying to spin a sad story if it was up to me I would just want to drop dead. But I can’t do that bc I know I’m to much of a cowered, and if I died it would destroy the lives of those in my life. But I just don’t want to live, I can’t even smile rn. I don’t even feel sad rn, I just feel…nothing. I don’t know what to do. I know hate and am scared of myself. What I find funny though is that I want to be a Psychologist, pretty ironic. It’s what I’ve been good at,  ring the therapist friend, an empath, understanding people. Again I don’t want to spin some sob story, I just needed to get it off my chest. I want nothing more than to go tell my mom or dad and hug them as I cry but, I just can’t. Sorry for the rant. I’m fucking pathetic. I just don’t know what do. I don’t  know where to go from here. I don’t want to live but I don’t want to die. I feel completely insane.",mentalhealth,Visual_Ad3595,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dg83wd/im_completely_insane/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

Still don't know myself ,1,1.0,2024-06-15 02:43:39,"I'm turning 30 in about 2 months, have a job that I've enjoyed for  a bit over 3.5 years, I'm starting classes in August, I'm married, I have 2 dogs, some other pets, I don't really enjoy videogames much anymore, I enjoy food probably too much, I enjoy watching movies with my wife, but I still have no idea who I am! 

As my 30th grows closer, I find that I'm just more anxious, depressed, and just frustrated with myself because I just... Don't know who I am. I don't really enjoy things that are outside of daily, monotonous life, I hate going out because there's always too many people, or it's too hot, or too cold. I mean shit, I have to get high to go to Sam's club because there's so many people and I get so worked up and pissy

Truthfully, most days I'm frustrated that I'm still here and taking breaths, I've made it farther than I have ever thought, but it's just so hard because I just have no clue what I'm even doing here. Outside of work, I genuinely don't have any close friends, and I know if something were to change and someone at work leaves, I won't even make the effort to text them, just maybe send a tiktok every now and then. 

I'm essentially astranged from my entire family aside from extremely infrequent text conversations with my grandmother. This is by choice just because I've always thought, ""well if I'm gonna end it all, I better not leave behind anyone who will care enough to miss me"" 

So I'm coming to y'all in an effort to find out who my next step could be. So please reddit, how can I actually find out who this depressed lump of spoiled potatoes is?

As I'm thinking about this post I'm going to keep adding to it but above is the original post 


I feel like I've plateaued at work. I've hit some kind of ceiling and I just am worried because I just don't retain any more knowledge. Previously at all three locations I've worked at, I've been seen as one of the best in my position in that district, but I just don't think the next level is coming for me at this point, which is why I signed up for classes, just to have a backup plan that hypothetically should pay better provided that I actually finish it. 

I've noticed that subconsciously different forms of media are hitting me harder than they used to. For example, my wife and I watched the full first season of Hazbin Hotel on Amazon prime when it came out, I loved the show, but while my wife handled it fine, a lot of it was really tough for me to get through. 

At this point I'm positive that I have childhood trauma that hasn't been worked through, but I've gone to therapists and I just can't talk to them because I'm just so anxious and simply cannot to be vulnerable in the moment, as much as I'll want to open my mouth and say anything, I just can't get myself to do it 



I just sometimes wonder if there are different forms of beings that we all are at our core and mine is just some outrageously negative entity that refuses to back down because while I really genuinely try to be positive and give off good vibes around those who I like, I just come home to be this sullen, quiet, mopey dude that I am when I'm not playing up a character for everyone I see on a daily basis.

Switching from depression to anxiety to depression again ,1,1.0,2024-06-15 02:27:20,"When I was around 14-years-old, I felt constant hopelessness, cried daily, did not really feel happy and I had suicidal thoughts. When I was 16 I started dealing with my depression with a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was on anti-depressives (only for a short while, I started to see dependency patterns and quit) and I worked on my past trauma with my therapist. 

I don’t remember when I stopped feeling as depressed, or when there was a change, but suddenly the problem wasn’t depression, but anxiety. At 18, I lost some friends and started a new chapter of my life. I was having anxiety attacks daily. I would wake up shaking, sweating and breathing heavily. Everything was a worry to me. It was hard for me to answer text messages, start doing work or go out with others. Even worse, it was during the pandemic, so I was hyper-vigilant of everything I touched and worried way too much about it. I spent 2 years and 4 months on medication. During the long whiles that I was consistent with it, I would stop having irrational anxiety attacks, although the ones triggered by circumstances in my life did affect me a lot and I still woke up with anxiety. 

I can say with confidence that, although anxiety really impacted my life, I was happy. I went abroad for 5 months in which I still had anxiety but managed to live with it (and medication for it). I started working and managed to face a lot of the fears that anxiety had put up. 

Around a month ago I contacted my psychiatrist to see if I could stop taking my medication. I really did not want it to be a long-term solution for my anxiety, I wanted to be able to operate without it, so he heard me out and told me to stop taking them little be little. To my surprise, no anxiety attacks or constant fears and worries returned. I did suffer from secondary effects like dizziness, headaches and feeling tired, but I’m not feeling it anymore.

However, little by little I have felt more and more depressed since then. I don’t laugh at my boyfriend’s jokes anymore and I can’t seem to enjoy going out as much. These days have been even worse, every small bad moment makes me feel totally defeated and I have returned to my hopeless, tired, crying self. 

I can say with confidence that I was happy because I don’t feel it anymore. I am not motivated to do anything. I have returned to a toxic mindset that compares myself to others and thinks that I have nothing good to offer. Back then I used school work to distract myself from my own thoughts, now I am doing it with my current job.

I’m scared I will return to my depression and I don’t know what to do without it. Does anyone have some advice?",mentalhealth,notinisolation,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dg7r3z/switching_from_depression_to_anxiety_to/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06
I Feel Petty and Fake and I don't know what to do or who to talk to.,2,0.76,2024-06-14 22:19:44,"For context: 24 M, recently I am actually fit and ""appealing to the eye"" according to some. Also a nerd. I do Computer Science and Acting/Singing for my job.

I don't have friends. Friends to me are people that CHOOSE to hang out with you. I get invited to things, but only by default as a blanket statement. People tolerate me while I am there, but that's about it. I got sick of being the person who reaches out, so I stopped.

Why I Feel Petty:

I'm moderately talented. Not based on my own self worth, which doesn't exist, but through achievements. I was set to be on a Broadway tour before it was cancelled in covid, blah blah: I'm not here to brag.

In my current concert show, someone will finish their song or hit a high moment and everyone in the cast will cheer. But for me: silence. It makes me upset.

So I feel petty for wanting attention. It shouldn't matter to me, and I hate it so much that it does. But It feels like a gut punch every time when I work my fucking ass off.

Why I feel Fake:

I don't tend to talk if there isn't something for me to add to the conversation. Normally that's good, but people don't engage with me in the first place, so I'm just always silent. And when I try to start one, it gets ignored.

So I adapt myself to collections of people. I basically ""act"" in whatever way I think will actually cause people to engage with me. Or I am copying something I have seen someone else do. I will dive head first into a hobby and get really into it just because I think it will actually get people to talk to me.

And maybe it's a cycle. Maybe I do this, people think it's fake, they don't talk to me, and I change myself again. But the few people I've opened up to aren't my friends anymore, so I just don't bother anymore. It's easier to be a fucking sociopath than to be myself apparently.

I don't even know what's real about me or not. Do I like things, or is it just because I thought someone else would talk to me if I did?

Why violent thoughts?,1,1.0,2024-06-15 01:31:19,"I find myself occasionally looking at a person (whether it be myself, family, or just a random person) and briefly thinking how a violent act would be to them (before casually brushing the thought away and continuing on my day). 

Like sometimes I'll look at some random person and wonder how their life is, their likes and dreams, how the world might seem like through their eyes, etc. And sometimes I'll look at someone and wonder how they'd be/ act with, say, a knife plunged through their chest, or them in despair, etc (never them actually dying, though, just in pain/ fear/ desperation).. Even with myself too, sometimes I'll be going around the house, and I'll glance at a pair of scissors or a knife or something, and get a thought of myself jamming it into my skin, slicing myself open, etc... And sometimes, when eating with forks, or using toothpicks for finger foods, I'll get a thought of piercing it through the inside of my mouth, and how that would be like...

Whenever I'd have these spontaneous thoughts, it'd never give my any sort of pleasure, cause me to become scared/ worried, or anything.. Just purely a mere wonder that I'd casually brush aside, as if it were just another cloud passing overhead.

Now, I'd NEVER actually act out any of these thoughts at all, nor would I really give them as much as a second thought, allowing them to subside just as quickly as they had appeared.. I'm a caring person, and don't like seeing others in pain/ desperation (IRL).

I’ve been considering therapy for a very long time. Some days I am completely and extremely out of order mentally (to the point where it’s noticeable and people find it concerning) and other days I do just fine, so it seems like my own mind is making it feel like I’m okay and that I don’t actually need therapy. I’m hyper aware of this going on and it feels like my own mind is gaslighting me? I don’t know how to explain it too well. 

I’m still debating about whether or not I should go to therapy because I don’t want it to be a situation where I’m just unknowingly making up stuff and wasting my own time.

It's kinda like object permanence for adults...,3,1.0,2024-06-14 19:21:31,"The situation I find myself in, is after \~10 years of pretty severe mental health issues where I was in and out of therapy and around \~5 years of being totally isolated with no friends or acquaintances, I'm finally feeling like I'm ready to move on and finally be part of the the world around me. The problem is, a lot of the work I did to get here was focused on being aware of what's going on in my head, separating personal feelings with what's going on in front of me, and seeing the emotion behind other peoples action instead of just judging them based on that one experience.

Now I'm sitting here thinking, ""okay I'm ready to get out there, get a job, get of SSD, and start living my life,"" but I'm also kinda like, what's the point? I really want to find a career I feel good about where I feel like I'm contributing and actually making a difference in a field I feel strongly about (working on being trained as a peer support specialist). The thing is when you hear the discourse and discussion around issues like mental health people really seem to struggle with seeing the complexity of the topic. When I was diagnosed with BPD I was told ""all or nothing thinking"" was a symptom, but when I look around me now, it feels like \_most\_ people struggle with that. I don't just mean a little either. It's so bad, I like to use the example of how when a small child is learning object permanence, peek-a-boo is super entertaining to them because they don't understand that something can exist, even if you don't see it in front of you. The lack of understanding depth and complexity in an issue (I used mental health as an example, but it's honestly any decisive issue. Just figured mental health was a less toxic subject given the subreddit) is a lot like a toddler not understanding object permanence. A lot of people feel super strongly about things, get super emotional and upset about it even, but their whole outlook is based on personal experience or something they heard somewhere.

The world is a very large and diverse place, literally the only thing every human has in common on this planet, is that your perspective is unique. No two people are exactly the same, even genetically identical twins will experience the world different simply because they are separate individuals. I really just wish there was a way to get people to see this and be more collaborative, and work harder at coexisting with others.

FYI I know a lot of people feel this way to some degree. It's just, I feel very passionate about this subject, and I want to actively do something about it. I mean, if there was some kind of profession or degree I could work toward where I thought I could address this, I would. It just feels like too big an issue for anyone person to address. It's also a bit like a hydra in that cutting off one head makes no difference. Similarly focusing one issue makes no difference. The problem is not mental health, lgbt stuff, or any other major topic that people like to argue about. It's the fact that we can't talk about these things objectively. The entire discussion is based purely on emotion, it becomes impossible to see things objectively.

Also I flaired this as as opinion/thoughts, but I'm mostly just venting. I know nobody here has the answer, that's not really what I'm looking for.

Trigger warning to those sensitive to topic of suicide ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 23:56:29,"Hi all, first time post on this group. 
This will be a long story, so I do apologise. I wanted to give as much context as possible. 
I guess I'm kind of looking for advice more then anything. 

6 years ago I lost my best friend to part suicide and part a heart attack. 
She died because she'd stressed her heart too much by a overdose. 

These days I have learned to cope with the loss, and do my little gestures on her birthday and anniversary to celebrate her. 
I'm in a way better place then I was, but this loss has made me super sensitive to anyone in need with their mental health. 

For roughly 1 year I've worked in a doctors surgery. I have rough days with patients frustrations etc which I've been able to cope with, even if I feel awful I can't help any more then I can. Recently though there's been someone who is well known to the surgery. They continuously call asking for a doctor to speak to them and today was the worst I've experienced. 
This person suffers with severe mental health issues (i.e depression, ptsd) and tells the doctors when they feel suicidal or just need support. Usually they have one appointment a week, and things calm down each time until the next week. Today they had said they feel suicidal to me over the phone just after the morning rush had finished. I did my job in telling them I will message an urgent task to the doctors and let then know she's needing help. Afternoon crawls round and I recieve a call again asking if the doctor will call. I realised no one has read the task and I feel helpless. I tell them I will send another message to alert them of my message. An hour later the patient emails the practice saying they have no need to speak to the doctor, because they have no option but to kill themselves. I'm mortified, and copy this email into the task already sent hoping someone will read it. Im not able to go to the doctors as they are clinic with other patients. Roughly an hour later before I'm due to finish I get a call from them telling me they have tried to strangle themselves. I am on panic mode and tell her I'm going to get someone. I can't handle this anymore today. I can't hear someone tell me these things and have to sit there not being able to do anything. I let them know I'm putting then on hold and not to go anywhere. I tell my collegues in the back room and explain I'm no longer comfortable with this conversation. They agree and my manager speaks to them on the phone. Words are exchanged and my manager tells them they are sending an ambulance. Since I've been home I can't stop thinking about them hoping they are okay. The reaction of my collegues were of frustration that the patient was calling again and it was treated like a nuisance. I understand they are well known for doing this, but I've heard multiple staff saying they should just do it already. These comments make me feel sick because all I can think about is my best friend. It's making me think I'm in the wrong place for my own mental health, and maybe the NHS is not good for me. I'm not sure if I should tell my manager how I'm feeling. I certainly don't want to cause a fuss but I take these cries for help (whether it may be just be for attention or not) really serious. 
I wonder if they themselves have experienced suicide in their life or not, because by their reactions it feels like they haven't. 
Any advice is welcome. Thank you for anyone reading this.

My Old Bully keeps on Trying to speak to me,1,1.0,2024-06-14 23:51:12,"(apologies i am unsure if this is the correct subreddit to be posting this on please remove this if it is in the wrong one)

I’ve been bullied my entire life pretty much and i think that’s primarily due to the fact im an undiognosed neurodivergent (currently going through autism assessment process which is long and draining) for a long time my bullying wasn’t too serious and although my primary school experience with my classmates was so bad i still frequently get nightmares and most likely am traumatised by it it never really was too bad and went unnoticed due to them all playing nice. well my experience changed once i started secondary school a few years ago thanks to this one girl in particular who i frequently refer to as little miss. She was in all of my classes at the time and made my life a misery. i won’t go into too much detail of what she did as it brings back painful memories but she has attempted to push me down the stairs, constantly asked me uncomfortable questions because she knew i was uncomfortable also sitting extremely close to me, made up lies about me some of which resulted in my own friends stopping talking to me because they thought i was bullying her, she told me to kill myself multiple times almost on a daily basis. The worst part for me was the fact she denies it all she claims she’s never done such things and twists her words to make it seem like she always been really nice to me and i’ve just out of the blue decided to ignore her and “be mean”. Over the first two years of secondary school she with the help of her friends drove me to the point where i attempted to kill myself multiple times and sh frequently (i was 12/13). we had a lot less classes together last year so there was a lot less problems i just tried my best to ignore her and she calmed down a lot only really giving me dirty looks.
well i started my new school timetable last week and she’s in both of the classes which i not only was looking forward to most but the ones i am relying on the most to do well in in my exams to get into the uni i want to. She’s started attempting to speak to me again but it’s harder to ignore her when she’s been put in a seat by the teacher right next to me. she’s starting to slip back into her old ways which is slipping me into my old ways of sh.
i told my mum of my concern and she told me, “well if she’s always trying to speak to you maybe she just really wants to be your friend” and that hurt, my mum knows the majority of things she’s done. I’m gonna be honest and say little miss terrifies me every time i see her face i freeze or attempt to hide everything time she comes close to me i flinch im scared of her.
i’m apparently a very empathetic person i empathise with everyone around me including fictional villains im expected to despise. the only person whom i can’t empathise with at all is little miss which hurts as ik that to do all those terrible things she must have a reason maybe she has troubles at home im unaware of but i can’t empathise with her at all because how could someone be so cruel from the second she met me.
i dont want to kill myself i really dont want to but she brings back unwanted memories and makes me consider it again.

Fair, given the multiple times the neighbours would call the police on him since he was 5 years old for being a disruptive black boy riding his tricycle loudly.

he has taken psychedelic before and casual marijuana. once displayed a violent breakdown when he was on LSD, but no one thought anything of it, he was just high. 

Now, 4 years later, he’s been “sober” only smoking  cannabis rarely but mainly nicotine. His father, ends up getting into a fight with him and, father beats Art’s head in. Art never went to hospital to check if there might have been any damage.

Months pass and he is concerned someone(s) are out to murder him. who? he never really says, but he knows they are out there. “But what have you done Art? why would someone be after you… unless you’ve done something?” i try to put “logic” into his concerns. Doesn’t help when my grandmothers window gets smashed… while he was living there. Targeted? Maybe! Or could it because the ppl his father had an alliance with…

How to deal with relationship paranoia?,2,1.0,2024-06-14 19:33:58,"I am a deeply paranoid person. I have seen a lot of people in my family and around me cheat.
It has shaped me to not trust anyone easily.
I've gotten a few bad surprises too.

I don't know how to get rid of this paranoia.

I've had a rough childhood, and i got obsessive about work and money.
To the point that if i feel anxiety i open the office even if it is 3 am at night.

I work my feelings away, or i do enough drugs to be high till the next night
I can't deal with things that requires me to be emotionally available. 
It feels too taxing and a waste of time.

After my last partner 27F cheated, and gave me an std after a year long relationship,
I closed off completely 

My day was just working 12-16 hours,
Coming home, getting drunk or high,
Waking up and back to the office.

There is a deep insecurity in me regarding money and love.

So i often rely on these crutches when i don't want to feel this way.


After a shit show, i met this beautiful woman.
The perfect mix of everything i like.
When i saw her, time literally stopped.
A weird calmness took over me.

She's from a rich family, 
From a family where girls get married at 26-27
And i come from humble backgrounds.
She's beautiful, she's a therapist, she's fun, she's caring, she's sweet.

But here i am.
Unable to deal with my insecurity of losing her to someone.
Whether her family thinks I'm not good enough, or she ends up chosing someone else 

I don't know how to deal with it.

I'm currently writing this from my office at 1 am, drunk.
(I reached home at 10, but after this anxious feeling took over me, i rushed back here)

I don't know how to not ruin this.

Wibta for not feeling the need to apologize for my lack of energy or low mood when out with family and friends?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 22:52:35,"My sister (26f) and I (23f)  live together and have for over three years. My family is really having a rough time right now mentally we are all going through our own battles and they are all very difficult. 

However while living with my sister I have noticed a pattern of when I am having a low energy day (not speaking so much, quick responses, just following or not actively conversing) she tends to ask me 1. Why I seem to be upset and 2. Whether I can be a little more energetic or if she can make me happier.

Now the first one I have a problem with because she is aware that I have depression and have for years, meaning she knows that I have high and low days. I also know that I have been very low energy and generally quiet for a long time (years) so absolutely none of this is unusual for me at all, which irritates me because she acts like I’m upset about something specific or that I’m mad about something which is almost never the case I’m just having a low/bad day. At that point I don’t have the energy to do what I need to but I am which means I seriously don’t have the energy to explain why I’m feeling this way I also never really know why I’m having such a bad day.

Anyways with all that recently my mental health has gotten to a point where I was pretty positive I’d lose my job. Luckily I didn’t but I was bumped down from 30-35 hours to anywhere between 10-20 and it seems like 15 or less is what I have to deal with right now.

I am at a breaking point I have really just been put into shock and because of that I can’t begin to think of anything. I have a 4 day weekend (Friday and Monday off) and today is Friday and my brain has not stopped thinking about work and money and how I’m going to make it all work. I’m scared, Im genuinely unsure I can get another job based on my state of mind, I can’t possibly begin to understand how I’m going to live. And today my sister asks me what’s wrong because I seem upset. 

Now this whole post is for me to know whether or not I am the asshole for not wanting to change how I’m feeling for other people, and not wanting to have to explain that almost losing my job like 2 days ago has put me in a spiral and that I’m currently in a state of shock? Like honestly I personally feel that it is reasonable to expect that someone probably won’t be all happy go lucky less than a week after almost losing a job due to mental health reasons.

I do not want help options for me, I want help options for them. Are there things outside psych wards, parents, or crisis lines?

My best friend and I (both still in school) have gotten to know each other and I’ve clicked with them the fastest I have out of any friend I’ve ever spoken to. I had always been able to see that they were depressed and I’ve always offered my hand, but a few months ago they started opening up to me about their suicidal ideations. I have always made it a massive point that I am there for them no matter what and that I love them and appreciate them even though they can’t believe me. I have also always made it a point to let them know that they can call me about anything anytime.

This has meant that they have called me multiple times throughout around 7pm-4am timeframes needing support. I always pick up my phone and dial down the situation. In a few of these calls, they have had the intention to commit suicide. I know their method and how they would do it, the ‘when’ factor is all I am unable to understand as it keeps changing and I am under stress the more they begin to talk about it. (Note: I live too far away to get to their house in time if the situation is dire).

These calls used to happen quite frequently, (maybe once every week or two), however throughout this month and last month there have been very few and I thought things were looking up. The other day, I got another call. (Note: they do not partake in any self harming activities outside of this issue).

What I need to know is what I can do, what they can do, or where I can take them so that they stay safe. They go to therapy but refuse any talks about suicide because they don’t want their parents to know. I have suggested a psychiatric ward but they refused the idea because they will feel crazy, and again, their parents would know. I contacted the school about it, but they were absolutely no help as expected. I do not have a fantastic relationship with my own parents but spoke to one of them and they were no help either. I am not looking for support for myself as I am able to manage, I really just need to know other options besides crisis lines and psych wards.

Does anyone know how to get an actual diagnosis on the NHS?!,2,1.0,2024-06-14 18:41:05,"Apologies for the long post but this is debilitating...

Every NHS GP for the last 10 years refers me to **""steps 2 wellbeing"" (or similar)** for diagnosis, but their treatments fail to help & they tell me **""steps 2 wellbeing practitioners aren't qualified to officially diagnose""** - I go back to GP & the cycle starts again. Tried many GPs.

I have anxiety, depression & suspected CPTSD (all undiagnosed). Had it 10 years, lost my home, income & job & family as a result of this. It is debilitating.

Almost every NHS practitioner I've been referred to starts **""so what's wrong with you? is it just low mood or something?""**, fails to understand, constantly interrupts - yet when I attempt to work with them & tell them my story (which hurts each time I have to explain it), they respond with **""OH MY \*\*\*!! THAT'S SO AWFUL! I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING SO BAD!""** (or similar)...  then they make it worse.

I had an extreme experience 10 years ago. It lasted years. It was unusual (apparently), complex (apparently) - one practitioner told me it gave her nightmares -  result is debiitating. I was self employed and doing well in life before this started. It's gone on longer than a decade and I still have received no meaningful help.

NHS practitioners I've met are so arrogant, lack patience, empathy & effective treatment. I've met sociopaths who show more empathy than the NHS practitioners I've encountered.

I've come to realise these practitioners (even the best intentioned ones) aren't able to help me. They make me worse. Whenever I ask for an official diagnosis, I'm told it's **""we're not qualified to officially diagnose but you don't need that anyway""** defensively. NHS practitioners claim they're **""just as good as qualified psychologists/psychiatrists""**, but they've never treated similar patients and have failed to help me - every time. There are so many more reasons to need an official diagnosis than they realise.

Does anyone know how to get a diagnosis on NHS? or how to see a psychologist on NHS?",mentalhealth,Old_Kaleidoscope2455,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfy0oa/does_anyone_know_how_to_get_an_actual_diagnosis/,0,2.0,0.0,4.2665847482395e-06
You need rage. ,2,1.0,2024-06-14 18:41:03,"It may sound cringe,  but in my experience if you are in any kind of rut (not being able to wake up at the right time, go to the gym, eat the right food, not procrastinate, etc.) it is lack of constitution. 

You either don't think it's worth doing or don't think you can do it, likely the latter, and the only way to fix this is by having the mental image of yourself conquering any said given task. This includes passive tasks like dealing with cravings which you don't directly deal with but just endure. 

And that brings us to the title. For me, just having the rage towards becoming the person I need to be to not feel ashamed of giving up all the time is enough. For not choosing the each path and thinking life is meaningless as a result because I didn't choose to be who I knew I could be.

I’ve been going through a tough time lately and could really use some support. I’m feeling overwhelmed by academic pressures and my family’s financial struggles.

I’ve been struggling with feelings of anxiety, stress, and hopelessness. It’s becoming harder to stay motivated and focused on my goals. I could use some advice on how to cope with these challenges and find a way forward.

Thoughts on losing interests,1,1.0,2024-06-14 21:44:28,"I don’t think I’ve ever felt depressed for a long period of time only maybe days or weeks at a time so I’m pretty sure I can say I don’t have depression. But I am curious on how you would interpret this: so I am a big people person, not necessarily everybody but I get close to friends and family and always want to be around them. Me and my friends used to go almost immediately after work every night and hang out and drink. That’s when drinking started to cause problems because we started doing dumb things and constantly looking for something high adrenaline to do (also cuz we would all drive without even thinking about how much we’ve had) but I went to work everyday anyways and got the full time hours but on very little sleep. It was a good time but it had to end when we got too drunk one night and made a huge mistake. We had to quit drinking and as a standard rule of probation had to stop hanging out because you can’t hang with “known criminals.” It was hard at first but we all spent some time in jail and it made me more grateful for my freedom so I won’t risk it to see some friends. I started taking Zoloft for anxiety and that seemed to make me not care if I meet new people or go out at all, just didn’t care about it tbh. But I quit the meds after a few months and now I just have no desire at all to go out with anyone. I get asked to hang or go on dates and I almost always turn them down. It’s just crazy to me how I couldn’t stand to be at home for years and now it’s all I want to do. I’ve completely lost interest in even trying to make friends or date.

how do you deal with an existential crisis? ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 21:29:51,"
this might be a long read but if anyone can add some sort of personal experience or help i’d be really grateful. i dont know who to tell and i usually use reddit for problems i dont wanna talk about 😭 hopefully this reaches the right people

for context, i’m 16 and i have been experiencing this for a few months now. i have to say it started with the break up of my ‘boyfriend’. long story short, he was not good to me, i was infatuated with him, lied to him so he’d like me more, then became sick of him not treating me properly, broke up with him and then felt like i just lost something big. there were lots of things i would beat myself up over, like lying to him about things and completely abandoning my morale just to please him - and i then started to think about karma. i felt so guilty about lying to him so much and then i got on to the topic of eternal punishment or judgement.

i have been notoriously terrified of death in my family and with my friends, they still make fun of me for certain times when i got really upset about dying or the end and it is known that i get extremely anxious about it. i always have done - ever since i was little - to the point i would have panic attacks about dying in the night and bad anxiety around my health, to which i experienced panics that have stuck with me to this day.

also, not to lore dump, but i had depression for a few years, which i was medicated and had CBT for, along with OCD. so when this existentialism came around, it felt like a relapse, and even now it still does. the thoughts are always the same - i wake up thinking ‘death must just be like sleeping and my sleep was nice’, then by mid afternoon i start thinking to myself about death, then by dinner i start questioning life, god, my purpose, and by night, all i think about before bed is dying and the afterlife. it has been this way for 2-3 months now and its gotten to the point its truly soul sucking.

i do believe in a god, and the fact theres so many religions and i dont know what exactly to believe in, and whenever i try to question something in religion i get really anxious and lightheaded, i just do not know what to do. i go on deep dives every day, going on tiktok, google, even the bible itself to just find proof and evidence or find out whats going to happen to me after death. every day. it just doesnt stop and i always tell myself the same thing - as long as youre a good person and you strive for good things, in the end all will be good. however, my thoughts dont let me do that and the repetitive cycle of questioning, doubting, self hatred, confusion are becoming too much. 

i just dont know who to turn to. it’s embarrassing to admit to friends and family because majority are very atheist and i dont know if they’d be able to understand what im saying. religion was drilled into me from a young age through school too, and as a person terrified of death, i obviously turned to it. now my faith is less out of fear and more because i just cant comprehend how everything came from nothing - things like that. even so, it feels humiliating, like people will think im crazy, i feel crazy because i just dont understand anything and it leaves me crushed everyday. i just cant find enjoyment in loads of things anymore because i am so occupied with fear. 

i ask if anyone has been through something similar and what helped them? ",mentalhealth,natsukiisnext,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dg1tzw/how_do_you_deal_with_an_existential_crisis/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06
"Just dropped partner off at ER, they won't have a place to return to",30,0.97,2024-06-14 03:12:47,"I met Gabby (Fake name for always obvious reasons) about 4 months ago. They were in a very bad space, they said their Uncle was watching them with cameras and talking bad about them all the time late into the night. I believed this entirely, until they moved with me and my mom and dad. Then they started saying the same things about us, accusing me of cheating on them and saying my parents are watching them with cameras and calling them a variety of negative names. The accussations are so bizarre and plentiful, I can't even explain them all. It has been painful for 4 days, with me getting no sleep before work because I'm up all night trying to explain the truth and looking up ways to handle the delicate situation healthily. I got Gabby's sisters number and talked with her about what to do, and talked to my chemical dependency treatment leader (not sure of their title, they lead these groups I must attend because of my DUI's) , and looked up what I could online and it all led to the same answer: Get them help at the Emergency Room.

My parents said they don't feel safe, and are afraid of getting in trouble for these accusations and they are already stressed out as my mom just found out she has cancer, and my dad is struggling to find a job. They wiill not allow Gabby back after they are discharged.

I don't even know if Gabby will be discharged. I don't know how any of this works. All I know is that Gabby was experience purely auditorial hallucinations, but they were extremely bad, and led Gabby to thoughts of self harm.

About one hour ago I dropped them off, then cried in my car until I got home just to type this out. I was so happy for four months, and the demons Gabby are fighting and the horror that is mental illness stripped away the best friend I had. I feel alone, lost, and am focusing my strength on trying to explore the options for Gabby to be healthier. My job is stressful, I'm going through treatment for my second DUI, and I have no idea what to do. I am not asking for medical advice, that is why they're at the ER.

Do I talk to the social worker they are talking with right now after intake?

Where will Gabby go after being discharged? They have 0 family. They only have their aunt and uncle, which Gabby cut ties with by accusing them of horrible things and leaving with me to my familys. I can't support living with Gabby outside of my familys home, and they need my rent money as well.

If anyone knows any resources to go to, please, I have never wanted help like this before.

edit: Gabby is self aware and came willingly to the E.R. They know they were hearing things, but they would have some episodes where it wouldn't stop and they wouldn't accept the reality certain things weren't being said. We have been at the beach and Gabby says they can hear my parents talking bad on her, or threatening her. I know they were just at work.

  
Edit 2: Please understand, I absolutely love this person. They healed me by being them. Besides the mental episodes causing some grief and worry, Gabby is the most mature and understanding person I know. They came willingly to the E.R, consciously knowing they needed help. They understand my parents don't feel comfortable having them back. Everyone thinks they will be in there for awhile. The only true problem I'm trying to solve is where will they go once they are let out. They have 0 family, I am trying to find some government resource for housing for them.

Usually, I believe a lot of people procrastinate, and I was the same, like pushing homework, etc... to the last minute, not wanting to train right away, etc...

I wouldn't say that my mother wasn't wrong maybe she was but not all the time and most of the things she did was with a pure heart which nobody was able to see. My respect for my aunt at that time steeped very low because my mother did most of the work in the house she cooked for us our lunch and dinner which nobody valued she also cleaned around two floors of our house. My aunt made our breakfast only and most of the time she would be free and not even help my mother who had pain in her body but still kept doing her work .

After the fight my mom and aunt would not talk to each other and I would become the person to hear their anger about each other I think hearing so much drama from my childhood it has really taken a toll on me I stopped talking much I got addicted to social media and started liking all those fake happiness so much that I started neglecting my studies . I stopped talking to my dad and only talked to him when I needed something as I am still a student . 
My mom loved my cousin even more than me but my cousin started hiding things from my mom and if I would start to scold her about this she would start to fight with me over it and looked like sometimes to me that she also had started to hate my mom eventhough she is a 8 year old and doesn't need to involve herself in it .

She also told everything i tell to her to my aunt and she would come to me to fight over it as to why I scolded her . My cousin would behave differently she would be like a innocent person infront of her mom but a completely different person infront of me and mom.
 
I am so tired of these petty fights in our homes and my father doesn't even try to support my mom and just blames her for the fight.
I just want to take my mom and leave this damn house which is just full of sadness and grief I am just trying to work hard now and build a better carrer for my self so that I can just take my mom to a better place which is full of peace and just do all the things she wants to do in her life . I sometimes also think that my aunt looks down on me because I am a average student .
I am really sorry for venting out my stresses and just want to relieve my stresses and tell some people about it maybe. ",mentalhealth,ChemicalFragrant7512,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dg0qd6/i_dont_want_to_live_with_my_family_anymore/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

Struggling with homicidal thoughts,3,1.0,2024-06-14 14:24:47,"This is a lot so I'll only vaguely sum up everything. I've had homicidal thoughts since I was maybe 11-12, I'm 20 now. They come and go whenever they want, even in inappropriate situations. My problem is that for the most part they are unwanted, but sometimes I like them and that bothers me. I think I'm usually a good person, at least I try my best to be but even though they are just thoughts it makes me feel like an awful person for thinking about such things about people who I'm acquainted to. I had a weird upbringing, my dad left me and I moved a lot, always the new kid and struggled to find friends. I wouldn't considered myself an introvert but I enjoy my company and have only 1-2 good friends at a time. My mom remarried and I had a step dad with drinking issues and he used to beat me when he got angry. I'm just putting it in for context because maybe this has something to do with it. When the thoughts started I did hurt small reptiles and animals, but when they died I did still feel empathy and sometimes even cried. Now this is the reason why I'm writing this, I'm confused why I feel these strong thoughts of homicide and still feel empathy in some situations. Especially towards animals. Sometimes those thoughts make me feel amazing and powerful but other times in other situations it's the complete opposite and I'm conflicted. I personally think I have some capacity of empathy but let's say for a example situation like if someone had a car a car accident and started screaming and crying. I find it annoying and wish they'd shut the fuck up. I just hope someone here and give me some insight on what or why this could be happening. I don't want to talk to a therapist either because I'm afraid of going to an institution and to some degree I feel ashamed to tell anyone because I don't want to ruin the image they have of me.

For context, I’ve been struggling with depression, grief, guilt, worry (not necessarily anxiety). It’s not awful day-to-day, but I definitely need help.

However, in the meantime while I wait to connect with a therapist, I am trying to find some sort of guided self-help therapy. There are a million articles online about self-care, journaling, etc. but I want something that has daily prompts to journal about, or a specific thing to do that day to work on my mental health. Made by professionals, not self-help gurus. Not shallow stuff but like an actual guided process to get a start on healing. (And would overlap with actual therapy in a couple weeks.) 

Does that make sense at all? Does this exist? Or even like a YouTube channel with frequent (wouldn’t have to be daily) videos that are actually beneficial for mental health.

And one more question, does anyone still go to therapy in person? I would prefer in-person over telehealth, but that’s been an issue for me finding someone, because so many therapists only do virtual sessions. I feel like I’m the last person in the world who wants to go in person to talk to my therapist as opposed to staying home lol.

Occasional dejavu feeling,1,1.0,2024-06-14 20:04:26,"Hi everyone, I just had a question regarding this odd feeling I get every couple of weeks.

Some context, I have had a rough go at early adulthood. Alcoholism took over my life, and made my life unmanageable. Had terrible relationships with people that hurt me dearly, homelessness for a time, losing good jobs to alcohol, this list can go on for a while… It was a rather dark time dealing with the lows.  Luckily, I have been two years sober and have taken control of my life again.
Found a career based job, and quickly rose up the ranks to middle management making the more money than I thought I could without further education. I have a stable living situation, and can treat myself to nice things/experiences (which is new to me).

The odd feeling that I get sometimes is that everything will come crashing down. Like I’ve had a dream about it, or have a dejavu moment where I “know” something terrible is coming. Whether that be losing this job, an accident happening, or something worse. 
Almost like I shouldn’t get too comfortable, and it’ll put me on edge. Usually takes a day or two to shake the feeling.

My question is two parts. Is this something related to mental illness? Navigating sobriety has left me feeling as though I forgot what “normal” is. Should this be something I pursue in therapy, or will it go away after a time?

Parents and their obsession with deciding your fate,3,1.0,2024-06-14 13:54:21,"Hey reddit,
I normally am never on here, so sorry if I use the wrong channels.

I’ve been having a reoccurring issue with my parents, and it is their obsession with taking control over everyones life. I’ve tried everything in the book to fix it. From running away attempts at 16,17 and 19 to fighting with them, to having many open conversations where I try to make them see what I see. 

I’m currently a 23 year old woman, so ann adult. But my background is of a middle eastern muslim family. Don’t get me wrong. I love my roots and I found islam on my own again, so I don’t feel self hatred or anything. My parents are one of the strictest ones I know even in my direct family and family-friends. I’ve finished 2 studies and want to go for one last one. It is considered the highest level in uni, European law and politics. Through that id like to get a masters in human rights or something close to it.

My parents keep intervening telling me not to study. Shaming me and fighting with me. According to them I’ve studied enough, and should focus on working and marrying now. But I am not allowed to ever move out or travel alone. They dictate what I spend money on and when it comes to marrying it has to be a guy specific to my type of ethnicity. Even specifically our side of our homeland. They don’t accept anything else, and have said several times that theyll kill themselves if I do. I of course know it is all bluff but they’re kinda tying my hands behind my back at everything. 

I don’t see the use in working even more since I have 14k savings and still work parttime next to my studies. I’m a hopeless romantic that has lost interest in love, but am pressured to marry sometime soon to their specific guy. I am never allowed to move out since it’s a bad reputation for a single woman. 

Sometimes I think about what even my choices would be. God knows how miserable my life would be if I disobey. Or how theyd try to stop me from it. They know how to make use out of my empathy and how to create obstacles. Sometimes I believe that running away again far away is the solution, but then I remember my failed attempts due to guilt. And sometimes I truly believe that death is the only way I can be at peace. All I know is that I don’t deserve this, and they’re not budging at anyway. All I do is pay for their sins and issues.

Struggling with Mental Health and Weight Loss for Years—Looking for Advice and Support,1,1.0,2024-06-14 18:50:12,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out here because I'm really struggling and don't know where else to turn. For many years, I've been battling with my weight and my mental health. The constant bullying I’ve faced, including from my husband's family, has been relentless. Though they had stopped for a while, the hurtful comments have started again recently, and it’s crushing me.

I was diagnosed with severe ADHD, which makes everything harder. My ADHD impacts my ability to stay focused and consistent with my weight loss efforts. I can’t seem to stick to a diet or exercise routine long enough to see real progress. It feels like I’m at the end of my rope, and I honestly don’t know what to do.

I’ve been seriously considering a gastric sleeve surgery as a possible solution. However, my husband is very against it. He thinks I’m choosing the easy way out and insists that I should focus more on my eating habits and exercise. Trust me, I’ve tried. I’ve tried everything—different diets, workout plans, even medication—but nothing sticks because I can’t maintain my focus and motivation.

This constant struggle is affecting every aspect of my life. It’s taking a toll on my self-esteem and how I feel about myself. I’m 5’3” and 90kg, and every day feels like a battle against my own body and mind. I feel judged and uncomfortable around people, and it’s exhausting.

People treat us fat girls very differently. It feels like we don’t belong anywhere. Trust me, I’m not a pro-body positivity advocate. I don’t believe that being overweight is something to be proud of because it’s not healthy. It impacts your sexual life, your day-to-day activities, and overall well-being.

But above all, it’s the bullying that’s killing me. The looks, the words, and the endless comments directed at my husband, who is very fit—""You can do better."" These words cut deep and reinforce the feeling that I’m not good enough. They make me question my worth and my place in my own relationship.

I feel trapped. On one hand, I want to make a change for my health and well-being. On the other, I don’t want to go against my husband’s wishes. Would I be wrong to go ahead with the surgery despite his opposition? I’m desperate for a solution that will help me regain control over my life and health.

I’m really at a loss here. I want to be healthy, not just physically but mentally too. I need to find a solution that works for me, but I feel so trapped and overwhelmed. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope or find a way forward? Any advice, experiences, or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

I had a weed-induced psychosis last night. Why did I go through that TERRIFYING experience?,2,0.67,2024-06-14 14:56:59,"I have never tried any cannabis in my life. Rarely drink. No history of mental illness as I know it. But I had 1-3mg of a weed rope gummie last night in the presence of friends -- a tiny piece! -- and two hours in, after a weird kind of relaxing high and slight headache, I started to lose my mind.

I stumbled to the bathroom in a daze. Came back and absolutely nothing felt real. I felt like I was both asleep and awake, alive and dead, stuck in my body. I was extremely paranoid if this current moment was real and I was panicking if this feeling would ever stop.

I remember asking my friends incessant questions and them calming me down. Taking a cold shower. Throwing up, asking them to take me to the ER. Being in the hospital and sleeping it off.

I cannot explain to you the dread, panic, terror, and paranoia I felt. I never, ever want to experience that again, and just remembering the moment makes my stomach churn and take me back to that place.

WTF did that happen? The one thing I am so incredibly, deeply grateful for is that it happened with my friends, who I trust. The thing that grounded me over and over is that my friends are kind, they wouldn't fool me, I trust their judgement, this is reality. But it's like remembering that love was my last tether to reality.

Am I screwed if I missed out on close childhood friendship and other youthful things?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 18:34:17,"I'm 23M. Long story short, I had a best friend when I was in early childhood and honestly that was the best part of my life. But then he moved away and although I had some friends after, none really ever came close to him. I just felt so loved and special around him, but he moved away so soon.

I experienced some neglect too. There were times in my life where the only peers my age I got to see were like once a week on Sundays for 3 hours at most. It really sucked.

I wish I could've gone to sports. I wish I could've seen other kids my age every day like the public schoolers got to do. I wish we had more money to do fun stuff with my friends. I wish I got to have a big birthday party with my best friend and a bunch of other people. I wish I could've gone to prom. I wish I could've had a sleepover (with close friends that actually liked me). I wish I could've seen my friends every day in summer and did summer stuff, even if it was just one friend.

I was such a lonely child. This probably sounds pathetic but in middle school I used to pretend I had a little brother and he'd sit with me in the car and talk and we'd cuddle.

Why do I always have to be alone? Why do the people closest to me always have to go? I don't mind having responsibilities or do adult things but all my friends wanna get married, but I'm not ready to move to that stage of life. 

I just want to be as close to someone like a little brother like I could've been in childhood.

"I did something stupid and I could use ""there there"" ",5,1.0,2024-06-14 09:48:43,"I'll keep this short. I have the diagnoses of cPTSD, autism and chronic depression. I've battled with alcohol/weed addiction all my adult life because my brain wouldn't shut up. Nowadays I have good medication to help with that. But this week I did something stupid.

My doctor has just changed my dosage of bupropion/wellbutrin from 150mg to 300mg. That has been going amazingly well. I was doing so well that I thought it's okay if I smoke a little bit of weed on Sunday night. But then, old habits, I kept smoking all day until Monday night when I realized that this is a bad decision. Tuesday was spent in physical exhaustion from weed withdrawal. Wednesday I had a date. Since I was feeling okay, I shared a bottle of wine with my date. The date went really badly actually. So I was spiraling at night, which is when I took a diazepam to calm down... while tipsy from the wine and while also recently on bupropion 300mg, yes. And the next morning, Thursday, I wake up in a heavy depression, way more than the failed date would call for. I forced myself to go out with a friend and have two more heavy drinks to calm myself down, and then I'm still in a bad mood. Late at night I realized that my medications already had a warning for alcohol use and being used together should be with caution, not while tipsy, and having used weed in the same week (which gives me mood swings)... So I basically induced a heavy and sharp depression on myself.

I know I fucked up. I'm feeling a bit better today (Friday) and decided to not have even a little bit of light beer for a couple of weeks to stabilize again. Can anyone relate to making such mistakes? Could I get a digital hug? 

Please don't judge me too harshly if you are the judgmental type. This weakness is part of my disorders and my autism doesn't help with remembering crucial health details or interoception.

Then it was also adhd and pmdd on top of that. Then it was bpd that was the biggest factor. And now my NP thinks my main issue is just that I am mentally exhausted so any type of stress is hard for me to handle. I do agree to the fact that I am mentally exhausted but I don't want to believe thats the only thing thats wrong with me. Mainly because I don't know it makes me feel like everything I have dealt with for the last 10 years is almost my fault for just trying to do too much. But also the only solution to fixing mental exhaustion (if thats the only thing I have) is to give myself more time to rest and not be stressed. Unfortunately I am in a situation where I am doing the least amount of things possible which is still a lot. I have to do all this stuff because I need money to survive (I barely get by with my current paychecks) and I have to go back to school to get a different degree or I am screwed.

And like I said I don't want to believe that mental exhaustion is the real thing wrong with me. But at the same time, none of the meds i have taken have made any significant difference and I have tried many. Also none of the therapy that I have tried has helped me either.

I don’t know whether I need to be tested further medically? Can someone clear this up?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 18:08:41,"So I, 16M from the UK have been struggling immensely from anxiety/stress for the past 8 weeks. Have always been a ‘worrier’, but have only now been diagnosed and put on medication.

About 4 weeks into this hellish experience, I began to feel the very familiar feeling of dissociation. Although I haven’t experienced this in a long while, I have had rather scary episodes of it in the past. However, these experiences were when I was younger, and it was more ‘derealisation’. But, as a now older, more aware person, these feelings are far scarier.

I’ll try and keep it brief. Whats scaring me, is i constantly feel confused. About the time, the place im in, what im doing. All of it. It’s like a constant detachment from any sense of reality (I know how in describing it sounds exactly like dpdr, but it feels ‘different’). But everytime it comes to these feelings of confusion, i’m able to tell myself ‘you’re at home, the time is so and so’. But it’s like I didn’t know that, and that information just ‘appeared’ by miracle. I’m sorry that this is so vague, but can someone please tell me that these very strange symptoms are normal? Or if I need to be examined by someone for some sort of nasty neuro disease? (had a brain MRI come back fine a few weeks back, but feels like i’m getting worse, also on sertraline + propranolol)

I have got soo many compliments saying that ""you're my therapist"", ""you got some type of healer vibe"" I just respond with a smile.

A predator relative ruined the way I see things and I have no clue what to do.,9,1.0,2024-06-14 06:18:15,"I posted this a while ago and it got absolutely 0 replies or advice. So I simply tried forgetting. Recently though, something reminded me of this, and I'm starting all the progress of forgetting over from the start again. Also, for context, I'm a dude, which may be important but may not be? I don't really know.

So i'm not really going to elaborate, but let's just say my cousin did some very bad shit to my sister. I never knew anything happened or was happening, and the whole time we were just totally fine. I never even knew. Until I knew. The man is a monster.  

Fast forward to after all this was revealed to me, a ton of stuff is totally tainted now and it's making me super sad. I used to love rebuilding computers, but ever since I found out about what he did and that he did that too, it just reminds me of him. I used to love playing multi-player games with him since he was good at only some of them and I was good at most of them so I'd usually beat him (I admit I did take advantage of that). 

A few days ago (a few MONTHS ago, this is old but applies) I was playing an online game and thought about the times i played it with him, and then thought about what he did, and then remembered that he made me sit on his lap while playing and that train of thoughts was so disturbing I literally froze while playing the game while online. It must have been 5 minutes or so of me just sitting there listening to Team Fortress noises blasting in the background having some sort of terrible mental event until I finally sort of ""snapped back"" and just shut the computer off and went to bed. I havent opened it since out of fear of being reminded of him. I feel bad for my teammates, because I'm sure I probably made them lose.  

Even my college planning is getting screwed up. My current choice of college is a community College, and since I'm kinda dumb and also kinda poor, it's the only option I have. Fine school, but it reminds me of him. I'm genuinely not sure how to handle possible taking classes in a school he went to. I even remember visiting him once. I'm considering crossing it off my list. (Even months later this is still true, but sadly it's like the only college I can get in in range of me that isn't either extremely suspicious, online, or a trade school.)

Hell, now that it's been a few months since I wrote some of this I notice that even my *laugh* sometimes reminds me of him. Now I want to reprogram my throat so I can stop thinking of that vile monster when I start laughing. Thank God me and the rest of my family have a restraining order on him, but he's *STILL* fucking with me.

insecurity causing mental health problems affecting quality of life ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 17:32:23,"
I've struggled with insecurities about the size my nose my whole life. My nose covers a huge portion of my face and  It's something that affects every part of who I am and how I live. Because of it, I've missed out on so many experiences, hiding away from public events and basically living inside.

I can still remember the first time I felt ashamed of my nose. I was in middle school when some classmates made fun of its size. Their laughter cut deep, and ever since, I've been self-conscious. I avoid mirrors and feel a pang of pain whenever I see my reflection. It feels like I can’t escape the feeling that everyone is staring and judging me for something I can't change.

Over the years, this insecurity has taken a serious toll on my mental health. My nose has been the main cause of my anxiety and depression. Social situations have become a source of immense stress, and I find myself avoiding them whenever possible. I’ve missed out on so many important moments, making excuses not to go to parties or even family gatherings. I skipped my own graduation because I couldn’t bear the thought of standing in front of everyone. Instead of living my life, I've spent so much time hiding away, scared to be seen.

But I don’t want to live like this anymore. I want to be able to go out and enjoy life, to take photos with friends and family without worrying about my nose. I dream of the day I can walk into a room and not be judged 

I've looked into rhinoplasty, a surgery that could help me overcome this insecurity. However, the cost is beyond what I can afford. It’s gotten to a point where I feel like I just can’t bare the pain anymore I just can’t keep living like this.

"I destroyed my friendship with my best friend, relapsed, and then made everything in my life a thousand times worse.",13,1.0,2024-06-14 03:20:31," ~~ I posted this in another subreddit, but figured I could maybe use some kind words or hope if you have any to spare. I’m out of them myself. I’ll finish the post in edits due to length. ~~

I’ve been an addict of some sort since I was 15 years old. It started with little white lies and leading a double life out of fear of coming out as trans, evolving into alcohol to cope as a young adult. By the time I finished college, I was taking and abusing pills and meth on a semi-regular basis, and I was a full-blown opioid addict by the time I was 26.

Eventually, I sobered up, started AA, and turned my life around, hitting a year of sobriety. Throughout all of it, one of my best friends, Kyle (name has been changed) stood by my side. For context, I had previously developed romantic feelings for Kyle and was shot down in the kindest of ways, and over time we got closer and closer and became as close of friends as friends could be. My feelings for him never faded, but I just kept them to myself, always respecting his boundaries and never wanting to ruin what we had.

A few weeks ago, I started struggling with my sobriety. I felt the joy of my day to day life starting to slip through my fingers, and the pressure of recovery was becoming too much to handle. But because my life was going “so great”, I started having to look for reasons to justify relapsing; at least, that’s my theory for why I did what happens next.

One night, I invited Kyle over to my house to watch a movie and hang out. The entire time we’re together, I only had two thoughts going through my head: that I was in love with him, and that I wanted to get high more than anything in the world. I’ll spare all of the boring details of us hanging out, but as he was leaving and I hugged him goodbye, I did the very thing I was determined never to do and I kissed him, crossing that boundary. He texted me the next day that he wasn’t mad at me but that he needed time to build trust back in our friendship.

Later on, instead of taking responsibility and his feelings into account for the fact that I crossed the line and broke his trust, I doubled down. I became needy and obsessive. I posted online about how heartbroken and in love I was. I wrote poetry about him and sent it to him. I hounded him with confessions of my feelings. I treated him like an object. Deep down, I knew that I either needed him to fix me or I needed him to hurt me enough to break me.

And then it happened. After a few days of silence, he texted me and told me how everything I did and was doing made him feel and that he didn’t want me to reply or speak to him. I did what I sought out to do and I lost my best friend. Everything inside of me shattered. And that night, I wiped and deleted all of my social media, turned off my phone’s texting, drove into the city, and relapsed in a parking lot in my car.

It all happened so fast it was like a blur. Every ounce of pain and regret and sorrow and fear I had been pushing down the last year instead of actually facing in recovery came surging back up as I vomited out the back door of my car. The three minutes I was high . . . I don’t even remember them. I completely blacked out and woke up after hours of nodding off, realizing what I’d done. I drove home, got some sleep, went to an AA meeting, and left again to try and find a treatment center, only to be turned away at every step.

So here I am, exactly 8 days since the night I kissed Kyle. I’ve been using every day since that first night I relapsed. It took me a week and a day to lose my best friend, my sobriety, my job, my family’s trust, and probably a ton of other things I can’t even think of right now. I’m too scared to turn my texting back on. I’m too scared to download social media again. Right now . . . I exist in a bubble, isolated in the confines of my car. I doubt anyone is looking for me, but if they are, I truly don’t think I want to be found like this. Part of me wants to recover so badly and claw my way out of this so I can fix things with him. Another part of me wants to go on to the end of this because I deserve it.

But either way, no matter what happens, I feel so much regret for putting him through all of what I did. I made him a pawn in a game he never signed up for and I used him as a means to justify my own self-destruction. I want to make amends with him but I don’t even know where I would start. I wish I could take it all back. I wish he had never had to meet someone like me.

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, so I guess I just needed to confess my sins out loud while I still can.

Recovery is a beautiful thing, and one of my deepest hopes is that it works for others better than it did for me.

Working and my mental health have never been friends,1,1.0,2024-06-14 17:10:18,"Struggled with mental health for a very long time. I distinctly remember the 1st time I considered giving up in a permanent way when I was in 9th grade. Every few months or years from that point forward, I’ve had mental ‘collapses’. I am now almost 27 and struggling once again. I have had many jobs that ended in disaster because of my mental health. The full time jobs always took me out within a few months, the part time jobs I’ve had were more manageable long term and I had surpassed 1 years at my last part time job. The passion for the jobs was never there, they did not reflect my passions, they were just jobs. 

Fast forward to now, I’ve been working full time in a role that is centered around topics I’m very passionate about. But full time work has a way of killing me slowly. For context, the job is working with animals but it’s not sunshine and rainbows. I have no work life balance, my role is underpaid with little support, on call for emergencies, and every single day is unpredictable. It’s been 3 months and I’ve had a few complete breakdowns, one that I did share with my superior. My superior helped the best they could but they cannot change me or how the role is performed. Only mentioned that they are there to support me in anyway they can. I am now reaching some kind of collapse in my mental health. I feel like I need a break so desperately that I cannot get. 

I’ve had many mental health crisis where I came close to creating a plan and following through. But I have never followed a plan with intent or attempted. Every time I’ve reached that point, it was somehow closely tied to my work and my inability to have a job and be a human that can care for themselves. 

I start to look at everything through a different lens, everything feels different and scary and I feel like ripping my skin off.My chest will hurt like my heart is broken. It’s never ending and I cannot get relief. By this point I’m usually actively thinking “I cannot do this anymore and I want to be done” I start thinking about su*c*de and it starts a painful process where I cannot think straight, I start to mourn my life in a way. The dread and guilt of not being able to push forward becomes unbearable. I’m reaching that point and my therapist can only do so much for me.I am talking with her, she just advised time away from work for now. 

I was on medication for years and did have these struggles whilst on meds. I recently (april 2024) was weaned off my ssri and the relief of side effects has been wonderful but I worry maybe taking them again is the only way to maybe get an ounce of sanity back. 

Does anyone else here deeply struggle with working full time?Or have a history similar to mine where full time work leads to emotional distress? I really need insight, advice, and/or support.

She often becomes restless from 9PM-3AM, and has symptoms such as anxiety, paranoia, anger, and confusion. It's taken a huge toll on my mental health, as I constantly have to stay up late and help her.

She has no diagnoses other than anxiety and depression, but from what I've seen from her for *years,* this seems like sundowning.

She has no memory issues, and like I said, she is only 21.

Am I in the wrong? ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 16:45:52,"I needing some help and insight. I go to beauty school with girls between the ages of 17-40. I have a really hard time having patience especially with these girls that act like they are still in middle school. This week, I am trying really hard to have more patience and have a more positive energy. This morning we were doing a test review where we find the answer and then race to see which team can write it on the whiteboard first. This in general causes a lot of anxiety l for me. It’s really over stimming and it just feels like nobody is paying attention. When doing any type of test review, I highlight the answers in my textbook so I have better recall. We were asked (by our instructor) to not find the answers in the textbook before answering the question so we could have been recall. I was opening my book to highlight the answer (after it had been answered) and then shutting it for the next question. Some of the girls on the other team were getting on my case for opening it at all and then the instructor told me just to highlight afterwards so I closed my book and that was that. I could feel my anxiety rising so I left the room to try and gain my composure before coming back. When I left, I shut the door much more aggressively than what I wanted to and then I came back and that was fine. Afterwards, my instructor asked if I could talk to her in the office and so I went and she told me that she is going to give me the day off and send me home. Being on the verge of tears, I said okay, got my stuff and clocked out for the day. Before this point I was okay, had gained my composure, went back to the class and continued to participate. It was only after we had talked that my anxiety got super bad. I went out to my car and had a good cry for a few minutes and then I went back in with the intention of just apologizing to the instructor. When I walked back in, the head instructor saw that I was crying and asked what was wrong and if I could talk in her office. I said yes and went in and told her what happened. At this point I was hyperventilating and struggling to breathe. She told me that she understood where the other instructor was coming from and that I should talk to her to feel better and then go home. I went outside to catch my breath and hopefully calm down about the entire situation. Then another instructor pulled up so she could come inside and work. She asked me what was wrong and included that I have been working on being more patient this week and it just sucks that even when I’m trying, I just end up feeling like it was worse that before, and I told her and she said she would talk to the head instructor. I went in and apologized to the first instructor and told the head instructor I was going home. Now I’m out in my car crying again but I really am going home this time. 

Am I in the wrong for telling the other instructor who is now going to talk to the head instructor? I don’t want her to feel like I’m just going over her head and talking to someone else so they can make it better. 

Am I in the wrong at all? I feel like what I did was appropriate especially since I walked away from the initial problem that was causing anxiety and frustration.

Being in a relationship with a  narcissist (NPD). I have BPD. ,2,1.0,2024-06-14 12:54:55,"It all started beautifully, like any relationship. We were madly in love with each other. He accepted me as I was, diagnosed with ADHD, BPD, depression and others. He took care to bring me the medicines, to take them on time, and even arranged them by day. We loved each other very much. He accepted that I was trying to change (going to therapy and taking medication) and it seemed to make all my problems go away. I mention that at first I didn't know he had NPD. I idealized him, he was everything to me.

He knows what time I sleep (we only sleep with the video camera on, we don't live together), he knows when I wake up, what I eat, who I talk to, what I do all day, when I go to the gym, when I study, he looks at my phone. If I forget to do something, the hate attacks appear. He shouts, bangs his head against the walls, foams at the mouth (I'm not kidding) and blames only me. I have quiet BPD, I never argue, I am very calm and I try to stay that way in the situations mentioned above.

He gets upset if I talk to my family or friends because I don't give him enough attention.
He always tells me that everything is about me and that he doesn't feel that I love him. Although I do everything for him... Many times, after arguments, he threatened me to take his own life.

Can trauma cause mood disorder?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 16:32:14,"After I hit puberty my autism symptoms got significantly more intense and I couldn’t handle school anymore, but I couldn’t get out of school fast enough because I needed a diagnosis, which took the entire year to get. 

Then covid hit and that’s what got me out when I was at the end of my line. The following years were maddening. I would have a month where I felt fine, but then one where I wanted to claw the bones out of my skin. I would have nights where I wanted to do anything and everything nobody would ever reasonably do, I.e. run into the desert, chop off my arm, blow a ton of money on something I didn’t want. 

There were days where I was ecstatic, thinking I had recovered, nights where I felt overwhelming comfort after wanting to end it due to unreasonable guilt. 

I would fixate on things, like mind reading and how horrible of a person I thought I was. Or how I thought I was being spied on or that I was going to die under any and every circumstance. There would be months where time didn’t move correctly, and months where I wasn’t sure if I existed. 

I would get so scared and angry for dozens of weeks and then it would just stop. I didn’t even notice that something was happening that wasn’t in my control. 

I had hallucinations daily and then they just went away. I don’t even know how I overlooked that? Visual hallucinations usually were of animals and audio hallucinations were usually of screaming or my cat meowing.

I think I only noticed once I was put on antidepressants that made me think more clearly and remember things better. And when I started having a ton of physical symptoms all at the same time I realized it was weird that I seemed to change a lot.

Over the past few months, I noticed she started ignoring me and lying about her plans. When I confronted her, she gaslighted me, making it seem like it was my fault.

Despite my efforts to maintain the friendship, including giving her money during my financial struggles, she continually avoided making plans with me and often left me waiting without explanation. When I found out she lied about a dinner plan to go out with other friends, it hurt deeply.

After a confrontation that turned into a fight, I decided to apologize to end things on a good note, even though I wasn't at fault. I deleted her number, chats, and photos to move on, but I'm struggling with the urge to reach out again and seek her validation. It’s been a challenging emotional journey, and I’m dealing with feelings of guilt, sadness, and anxiety.

The Silent Toll of political dynamics on mental health🧠,2,1.0,2024-06-14 11:37:37,"In today’s fast-paced world, the intersection of politics and mental health is becoming increasingly evident. From polarized debates to policy changes, the political landscape profoundly impacts our collective well-being. Here are some insights into how this dynamic plays out:

	1.	Stress and Anxiety: Continuous exposure to political news can heighten stress and anxiety levels. The 24/7 news cycle and social media amplify political conflicts, making it hard to escape the tension.
	2.	Social Division: Political polarization can strain personal relationships. Families and friends find themselves at odds, leading to feelings of isolation and frustration. The sense of community is often eroded, affecting mental health.
	3.	Policy Impact: Government policies directly influence access to mental health services. Funding cuts or restrictive laws can limit the availability of essential care, exacerbating mental health issues.
	4.	Public Discourse: The tone of political discourse can impact societal mental health. Negative rhetoric, misinformation, and hostility contribute to a pervasive sense of unease and helplessness.
	5.	Civic Engagement: Conversely, political involvement can be empowering. Advocacy and participation in community efforts can foster a sense of purpose and belonging, countering feelings of despair.

Moving Forward

Recognizing these impacts is the first step toward mitigating them. Here are some actionable steps:

📌Limit Exposure: Be mindful of your media consumption. Regular digital detoxes can help manage anxiety.
📌Seek Support: Engage in open conversations with trusted individuals. Support networks are crucial during politically charged times.
📌Advocate for Change: Support policies and leaders that prioritize mental health. Collective action can lead to systemic improvements.

As we navigate these challenging times, it’s vital to stay informed without compromising our mental well-being. Let’s advocate for a healthier discourse and policies that support mental health for all.

I told him all the truths.. that I am not fond of Delhi and being there only affects me mentally and physically too because of the pollution of course, so much that I hardly go out in Delhi, I stay in my room which messes up with my mental health too.

On which he said beta it's better to have a bad health than bad character. I kept laughing at everything he said because I could see he clearly has some stories made up in his mind about me which are far from reality.

I told him it's better I keep visiting Delhi but stay elsewhere, and that I find Bangalore is perfect for me. 

But he and his smol brain couldn't comprehend what I'm trying to tell him I think.

And I said you're not gonna tell me that sir, I come when I wish to.

Why am I always cynical and in a bad mood? ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 13:18:41,"
To preface this I have autism:


My entire life i've been cynical and in a bad mood, anyone else like this?

All my life i've been cynical of doing things or going places, most trips to... anything? as a child ended with me crying, being hurt, getting sick or getting bored. Most family gatherings aren't that far off.

I've had a most loving family where im the golden child where everyone takes care of me, even my sibblings treat me more like a son than a brother, so im not sure why im like this.

Each time i try to change my routine i end up not liking it or being bothered in some way, the small things pile up, i fuck up my foot, my nose gets stuffy, etc. maybe thats why i dont like going to concerts, parties, clubs, whatever.

I don't know how to articulate this very well, but i feel like i'm perenially rolling my eyes.

I've had happy moments in my life but they were all very inactive and it seems the more active i am the worse of a mood i am.

I've attempted many times to get out of my comfort zone, worked out, met as many people as I could, went out to as many things as I could, traveled, but not only did I not want to, I don't look back on any of it fondly, even after all the progress I made I don't feel bad rotting inside at all and spend weeks doing so and I'm always so much happier.

Sometimes I wish I drank alcohol or did drugs,1,0.67,2024-06-14 13:05:36,"It seems like so many mentally ill, depressed, or just outright stressed people around me easily fall to the vice of alcohol and drugs.

It feels like cultural peer pressure. I get the ""well actually alcohol has been apart of society forever so it's normal and okay!"" Well, so has prejudice and hatred but that doesn't make it good.

Advice on how to figure out what the people close to me can do to help,1,1.0,2024-06-14 11:45:34,"For context I'm Bipolar with ADHD, up until very recently my coping mechanism was to isolate and just wallow in in depression until it either passed or I figured things out. As you may expect that hasn't been going very well for me. 

I've made a lot of big changes in my life recently and in an effort to better myself I decided to start opening up to my family about how I feel and the struggles I face with my BP and ADHD as well as informing them about how ADHD is something that affects me in my everyday life.

 I realised that it's been over 8 years since I was diagnosed and they were completely unaware of how ADHD affects people and what it entails. They were a little more familiar with Bipolar although they understood it to mean that you have episodes of mania (they thought it was ""happiness"") and depression. However they didn't know what those episodes entail, like what happens during those episodes or how you act differently and the subtleties of it. I decided to fill them in as best as I could. I found articles online and compiled a little info packet which had info taken from the articles as well as my own personal input and gave it to them to read through. I also wrote them a letter explaining how I was feeling and what thoughts had been occupying my mind and making me anxious, stressed out or just making me feel more depressed. I then set down with them and talked through everything. 

They were really supportive for the most part, they did push back a bit on the executive disfunction and for example said that they can understand it but there's certain things where  I should ""make more effort"" and ""prioritise"". I explained to them that it's not a case of me not trying, that I do put in effort and try to prioritise but that I struggle and that sometimes it's out of my control. I told them that I would start looking into ways to manage my ADHD better so that I can handle things in a healthier way and so that the Executive disfunction becomes a  bit more manageable and hopefully wont affect me as much. Thankfully they came to accept and understand what I was saying and the final question they had for me was what could they do to help? 

This is where the problem comes in. I have no idea what I need to help me. I've never had healthy or good coping mechanisms. Like I said in the start of the post I'd just isolate until it passed by. I have no idea what I need to help myself let alone what others can do to help me.

I’ve been waiting years to look at diagnosis only to be denied again. ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 11:39:26,"When I was younger I was constantly told ‘we don’t diagnose under 18s!’ And only given the bog standard talk therapy and antidepressants as a result and they have never even made a dent in my issues. I’ve had friends, family, myself and even some professionals suspect / mention or agree that it sound like I have PTSD and / or BPD. 

I’ve waited years to turn 18 and I finally have and I just got a new psychologist with the adult mental health system and suddenly they ‘don’t diagnose often anymore’ and ‘prefer to treat the symptoms rather than the condition’ which is so disheartening and also sounds like a load of bullshit that won’t work. It feels like I’m only going to be given the same bog standard treatment that wont work. 

My psychologist also keeps saying things like “that’s PTSD” “that sounds like PTSD” “this is used to treat PTSD” then follows it up with “I don’t think you have a disorder” when those are extremely conflicting. 

I want a diagnosis for multiple reasons, a big one being is actually have a name or maybe two for all my symptoms instead of just listing ALL my symptoms to every single professional I talk to each time. And another is I actually want more personal and specialised treatment because the general treatment just does not work. 

Is there anything I can say to get them to take me seriously for once?

Help with understanding what is causing the angry behavior? ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 10:59:40,"Hello,

I have a long time friend who's behavior is very strange considering that he is in the range of 30-40 years old and not a teenager. Many times when a disagreement starts his body language suggests that he is getting nervous very fast, as in just seconds. In those situations he cannot have a normal conversation, but behaves like subconsciously projecting his thoughts of ""how dare you not agreeing with me?!"" or ""how dare you interrupt me"", as if I can know when exactly he has finished talking (he makes small pauses, as if finished talking, so I start talking and he behaves, as if I intentionally interrupted him which is not the case at all).

He is constantly swearing and getting angry about the most stupid and childish things like not having internet connection while being at a beautiful beach or a mountain, or having some simple issue with electronics like connecting his phone to the computer or not being able to upload pictures to social media etc.

If there is something that isn't working or isn't perfect he won't miss the opportunity to complain and/or get angry about it.

The weirdest thing is that he has this issue for years and it happens in exactly the same way while on a **vacation** in a very beautiful country. His mental condition is exactly the same if he is on a summer vacation or in his hometown on an average day.

What I don't understand is what is the underlying cause of all of this. I know that some people are getting angry or annoyed faster than others, but from all the people I know no one would start swearing for not having internet connection or failing to upload photos online... Or say that he wants to destroy everything.

Another issue is that he is the true definition of hater. His romantic life is non existent. He hates everything, but most of all he hates women while also being straight\*\*.\*\* He is constantly talking negatively about them and thinks they are all the same. He never forgets to mention it while being with his male friend(s). He doesn't have much friends, as he mostly mentions just a couple of them.

He hates when it's too hot outside, when he needs to wait for transport, when there is a queue somewhere etc. He doesn't have the capability of not complaining about everything and everyone. He doesn't have much patience for anything.

Generally one would think that he is simply under a lot of stress, but he is **exercising daily** (fitness/football), so it's not like he is lacking stress relief activities. He is exercising a lot more than the average person. All this nervous energy must be coming from somewhere, yet he has always been like that - I know him since he was a kid. He definitely needs to start visiting a psychologist and I would probably tell him that in the coming months, but I am 99% certain that he had such suggestions from his relatives and ignores them. There is no way for them to miss such negative, toxic, hateful and worrying behavior.

I feel like he will completely lose his mind when he starts having health issues due to age/stress. If he cannot reduce his stress from exercising/traveling while young I don't see how he could possibly control his emotions and behavior at a later point in life. And he definitely has a ""fear of getting old"", as we have discussed how bad it can be while being old and having health issues.",mentalhealth,mentalhealth1989,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfo4gz/help_with_understanding_what_is_causing_the_angry/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

Why is my mind cursed (Vent),1,1.0,2024-06-14 09:57:30,"Im a 18F with diagnosed ADHD,Autism and Anxiety I’m not good at detailing my thoughts but I’m gonna try. And apologies if I ramble 

I don’t know what’s wrong with my mind, ever sense I was a kid when I would be around people or pets I would smile, sometimes be a chatter box to the right people but alone I’m nothing, when I sit alone I feel all my emotions drain from my body and it’s like it takes energy to feel even the smallest amount. i can’t smile and I tend to look at my hands as a scroll on my phone realizing that I do nothing, I have no social life besides a few people but even then around them I feel empty and like if I died a couple weeks could go by and they would forget about me,  I also have these dark thoughts about death and the thought about killing myself. I ever the first time I thought about death was third grade and the first time I thought about killing musket was in the 4th grade.

 I always think that if I would just die things would get batter for my family cause they wouldn’t worry about my medical bills or the space I take up. In the 6th grade I held a knife to my heart like the scene in The Princess Bride but I would never do it, cause although I have these dark and decrement mind the idea of pain that  would put my body through is something I would gladly pass on, I  cut myself with a razor junior year but the pain was a lot so I never did it again. I have been dealt a bad hand and I’m just done, I don’t wanna tell my family and cause them stressed cause they work so hard to provide and my mother sacrificed so much for me and gave me things she never had, I don’t wanna go to a therapist because I don’t wanna get sent away, I hear the stories and people in my family got sent to them and changed negatively, I don’t wanna tell my friends because they got issues themselves and last time I told a friend about me trying to cut myself  and he didn’t say anything for a moment  and I believe he had a panic attack and hung up so I apologized and swore to never do it again and I’m supposed to be the reliant friend, I give because I can and cause I care  and expect nothing, 

I would never tell my girlfriend at all because I’m single currently and previously got cheated on and another time told I love to hard so they left, but if I was dating I would never tell cause I’m suppose to be the knight in shining armor who protects and loves.  And even if I could tell and decided to I’m horrible when it comes to explaining my feelings to others so I just don’t. Because why explain something when even you don’t even know. Because of this I feel indifferent from everyone, I stare at my family at gatherings realizing I never felt that sense of community or that sense of belonging even as young as 8 years old. I watch my friends at the lunch table and even at graduation engage with each other realizing that I just don’t feel that sense of support. 

As I sit and finish this all I can say is the future is looking grime, I just graduated and have achieved nothing in life, I would never just abruptly kill myself even if the thoughts are getting darker and more frequent so all I do is just breathe and exist and hope that I go to sleep and never wake up

Is this abnormal? ,1,1.0,2024-06-14 09:38:49,"* I’m a bad explainer*, Tried my best on this|  For basically all my life I’ve had constant paranoia. It feels like when I simply go down stairs for a snack alone, I have the simple thought there’s going to be a house intruder, I will see paranormal take place, or my biggest fear which is bugs, a bunch of them are just going to crawl everywhere. I sit in certain places because looking at some angles remind me of a monster standing in the doorway. If that makes any sense. I don’t even look in some directions of my house because it makes my skin crawl. It’s worse when I take a shower, the loud noise of the water, and not seeing very well behind the shower window disturbs me. All of this goes in hand with my constant fear  of ghosts and paranormal. I still close doors when I’m sleeping, I can’t sleep without a cover or pillow over my head because it feels like someone’s standing over me. If I don’t sleep with a cover over my head, disturbing monster images pop in my head. When I’m in certain places I also fear there will be ghosts or paranormal. Going down the stairs, public restrooms is where I think of it the post. It’s scary. (For me) Plus when paranormal or ghosts take over my brain for a bit I start to look at rooms to hard and start to actually see figures because I overthink it so much. I’ve told people about this and they say it’s severe anxiety. Another specific thing I experience is I can’t leave TVs off/ blank while I’m in the room because I’m afraid a figure will pop up on it so I have to leave something on the TV so the blank TV doesn’t mirror the room. I’m getting to old to be acting like this. It interferes with my everyday life. What do I do about my constant/anxiety/ paranoia it’s miserable .

I care deeply for this girl I’ve gotten close with recently, but she has suffered with severe anxiety her whole life. She’s pretty heavily medicated and, of course, this really brings up my fear of bringing a child into the world that may end up with our combined super-anxiety or something.

Would it be bad if I cut off contact with my dad for the sake of my mental health?,0,0.5,2024-06-14 07:43:49,"*please feel free to ask questions/give advice*

BACKGROUND: 
Hey guys a this might be long but just want you guys to get informed on me and my dads relationship. Growing up I never really saw my dad much maybe once a year, he lived about 30 minutes away from us but always stayed busy with ex gf and her daughter and my other two siblings. He was known for standing us up and saying he would come to pick us up and the day would come and he would show up. When I was about 10 he finally started coming around more but that was very short lived. Once he got a new gf he became immersed with her and his new family that consisted of her and her kids and his kids on weekends (my half siblings).. At one point when I was in high school we started going over a lot as my older sister formed a bond with his gf. My dad’s gf always had a preference for my sister, then she started coming off as very money hungry and jealous as she would constantly favor my sister a lot, so I began separating myself from all of them as a whole. Then my sister and my dad’s gf had a falling out and I found out my dad’s gf. The last time we met up, he embarrassed me by looking at my public record and confronting me in front of everyone at the table about something that he found (it’s not bad but it is a secret I was keeping from my sister and my family)

THE PROBLEM:
Me and my dad’s relationship has always been a sensitive topic for me, I always get nervous and anxious and tend to want validation from him. If I called my dad to come and help I know he would come, he’s always been one to come and help but that’s if I call him. He texts me randomly and it always gives me so much anxiety about how I respond and how he responds. I haven’t seen my dad face to face since December when I graduated college but it was only for 3 minutes then he left. He recently texted me and I just felt like he doesn’t know me at all and it depresses me a lot. Like he doesn’t know anything about my life like a regular dad usually does and that’s because he literally lives 10 minutes from me.

Side notes: 
I’ve talked to my sister about this and she has encouraged me just to maintain contact with my dad but we both have had different experiences with my dad, and she also tends to be more naïve and too forgiving when it comes to my dad. 

My views on this: 
I know it might be very immature of me but I just see my dads lack of effort to be in my life, I don’t want to communicate with him about anything or how I’m feeling, I just want him out of my life, I’m 21 and I’m tired of having this problem with my dad.

Is it okay to feel this way?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 06:47:43,"M19

Got diagnosed with MDD or clinical depression a little less than a year ago. Probably would've went undiagnosed had I not broken down in front of my parents. I feel as If my medication doesn't work (Wellbutrin XL) and I have long since lost the buzz from smoking.

I have been dealing with depression since around the age of 13. Up until recently I have kept to myself in hopes of feeling normal again. (At the time didn't know I was dealing with depression). Having a constant feeling of lifelessness has completely taken over me. I feel as if I am simply existing for no reason, following common symptoms of depression, I feel as if: I have no purpose, No Drive to do anything, No will. I feel as if I exist solely for my parents and friends. Somedays or weeks are worse than others where thoughts of self harm loom over my head, yet I don't fear it. I feel as if I would have taken up SH much sooner had I not dreaded the idea of my parents finding out, and as a result thinking differently of me. 

Exploring multiple discussions online and can't seem to grasp how some people just live with this constant feeling. What baffles me even further is how some people start to feel like themselves again, experiencing happiness that could only be found within their childhood. Not trying to seem like a gloomy doom lord, however I honestly don't know how that feeling of true joy would feel like now, when reminiscing on my innocent childhood. I can't possibly fathom living like this, rather than viewing life through rose tinted glasses, I see everything in an apathetic view. Nothing matters at all I feel, nothing I try will change this.

Hereditary Lack of Empathy ,3,0.81,2024-06-13 23:10:32,"Hey folks… kind of a thought / vent / question I guess… trying to think of where to even start 

Ever since I was a child, a long as I can remember I have had a complete and total lack of empathy, like zero empathy. I didn’t know what to call it at the time, but as I’ve gotten older that’s what I’ve realized it to be. 

Someone could tell me their dog died last night, and everyone around me would be emotional and “oh my god im so sorry” and in my head I would have zero emotion whatsoever, like it didn’t even matter at all 

This has obviously led to some challenges in life, specifically with my spouse and trying to see others point of views. 

It’s challenging because in arguments I would basically have zero idea “what the big deal is” meanwhile everyone else is saying they can’t believe I don’t understand why someone is upset/sad/etc etc 

For several years now I’ve been told by others I lack empathy, so I’ve tried to find ways to “manually” cope with this problem… for example if someone said their dog died, I would say oh man I’m so sorry…. Even though I personally feel nothing about it, I just know via societal norms it’s just the right thing to say… so I’m basically solving the problem via superficial “emotional intelligence” more so then having any real thought or opinion or feeling on the matter 

Well recently I took one of those Genetic / DNA Tests and low and behold I got an alert saying that quote “I may lack empathy” because of a genetic mutation that actually physically makes it hard for me to chemically / emotionally have a reaction to these matters - so basically the entire things been genetic this entire time 

The problem obviously, is I don’t know any way to “fix” this , other then just trying to keep “faking it” and making sure I use proper language in empathetic situations without actually understanding at a deep level how it feels or what the issue is. 

Has anyone else ever felt or been this way? ",mentalhealth,Astimar,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfch5c/hereditary_lack_of_empathy/,2,3.7037037037037033,0.7037037037037033,7.901082867110185e-06

Too much death too close... It's messing me up a bit...,2,1.0,2024-06-14 02:48:19,"NOTE: I hope this is the proper place for this. I don't know where else to turn. And I have no idea who to talk to about this. I'm kind of in a bind at the moment...

It's going to happen. I know this! My cousin (younger than me) passed away in March 2023, my Mom passed away in October 2023, and my brother in January this year. I hurt! Not gonna lie! It's been tough! I just have been trying to deal with things. And on top of that, I have a memory loss issue (pretty serious... like forgetting stuff I SHOULDN'T be forgetting kind of seriousness!). I'm unemployed so I can't afford to go see a specialist to even figure out what it could possibly be. My wife is on disability and she gets SSI so I can't get coverage under her. My brother was 62 when he passed apparently of a heart attack. He didn't even know he had a heart condition. It just all of a sudden got him. I'm almost 59 so, that kind of hits me where it hurts.

So, I'm dealing with some things. Heavy things that I can barely wrap my head around. Like, I want to be here to see my grand-kids. But now I don't know if that's even going to happen. I'm hoping it will, but I could be gone tomorrow without warning. It's part of life and I dealt with that pretty well until my cousin then my brothers passing.

I am looking into a free clinic thing but with something like this, I'm afraid, it won't be free. I'm hoping it'll be way less than it would be going to a regular doctor and getting a referral and all that. But I don't even know if free clinics even look at brain/memory disorders. That seems like a pretty big deal. Something that wouldn't/shouldn't be free or discounted. 

So yeah, the memory loss thing and the family loss thing... It's scaring the ever loving crap out of me at the moment. But I have to be strong and let it ride. I'm going to have fun while I can. I play drums (hence the name) and really, that's the main thing that gives me pleasure these days. Just sitting down at the kit and playing my heart out on them. I'm really having fun doing that. And, I also love my family but I feel bad that if I'm gone within the next couple of years, that'll devastate my wife and my daughter especially... as well as my sister and my father. It's scary! And in some way, I feel like I may be alienating them because I don't want them to feel the devastation I feel now. I don't know what to do... where to turn... If this memory loss thing is simple to fix with medicine then I'm hoping I don't miss that train without insurance and looking for a free clinic that won't be able to figure out what this is. 

I've made a couple of calls this week and I'm waiting for someone to call me back. I will call them again tomorrow and find out where they're at with this. But at the same time, I don't want to worry myself to death... LITERALLY! This is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with in my life and I hope I can pull through this.

Unsure what to do,1,1.0,2024-06-14 06:31:23,"Topics: anxiety, paranoia, delusions

[Undiagnoised: family history of bipolar, however I typically show more signs towards BPD]

I [F20] have been experiencing intense anxiety for over a year now that has only gotten progressively worse. Over time I’ve noticed that I’ve stopped going outside during the day time and seeing anybody. At first I was just anxious and worried I would embarrass myself by being sick or having a panic attack in public and so avoided it, but I’ve noticed recently that I’ve gotten very paranoid too. Every time I’m around somebody, I feel as though they are reading my mind and judging everything I think. Or if I’m outside at night [usually the only time I can bring myself to do so now] I feel as though someone is following me and waiting to hurt me or that there are people staring at me from inside their houses. 

I was on track to attend university in September, however I’ve been self destructing and isolating and basically shutting myself off from the world. My Mum [who I don’t live with] has been messaging me and seems quite frustrated with me, so I tried to explain my situation [as much as I comfortably could] but I don’t think she understands just how much it is impacting me. I can’t do anything anymore, all I do is sit in my room all day. It sort of feels as though I’m waiting for something?

On top of the paranoia, I recently “re-connected” with God and started “feeling his presence” more and originally felt as though he was going to “cure me” of all of this. However it then escalated very quickly into delusions about an old teacher that I fixated on. For context: a few years ago at school, I became fixated with my religious studies teacher and believed that I had a spiritual connection to her and was destined to be in her life? and I completely recovered from that mind set in my time away from her, however recently a friend of mine said that she attended a new church and met said teacher there. According to my friend the teacher mentioned me and asked if I would attend the church. I think this sparked something in my brain because now everything feels like a sign again. However, all whilst I think these things, I’m completely aware of how utterly delusional I sound… but they just make too much sense??

Ugh, I don’t know.

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I probably need to be on some kind of medication but I also don’t want to go through the embarrassment of telling somebody about these thoughts in person. And even though I don’t believe my delusional thoughts, part of me want’s to “wait and see” what other signs I would receive if I went to the church and saw the teacher ETC…

I’d love advice or to hear anybody else’s similar experiences, so I feel less alone :/",mentalhealth,classifiedwrites,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfkcxo/unsure_what_to_do/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

What to do When Your Friend Makes You Feel Like a Fish?,1,0.99,2024-06-14 05:37:52,"Hello. Prefacing this by saying I've read over the rules, and this post seems fine. I'm not sure if this falls under the ""don't ask for relationship advice"", because I'm not dating this friend. My apologies if it isn't. Breaking any rules wasn't intentional.

In this context, to feel like a fish means to feel like you're stuck in a glass box being watched. But only when the humans are interested in you, which they usually aren't.

I have a friend, the only friend I've had in a few years, I'd guess. We're two years apart in age, both minors. I also have trouble with sleep and can barely stay functionally conscious for more than six hours a day.

Every time I wake up, I check my phone and I have discord messages from him. I read 'em, respond, and he asks me to chat. And then I get on and I...sit there. For hours on end. While he does other stuff that doesn't relate to me at all. Sometimes, we do text-based roleplays. Totally SFW stuff, obviously. We talk then, but if it isn't something he's actively interested in, he often gets distracted and forgets what we were doing. That usually leads to us stopping (because I feel awkward having to keep reminding him).

Please don't misunderstand. I'm not irritated because he doesn't dote on me every second of the day. I don't want that. That's exhausting. I'm irritated because I want to spend **actual** time with him. Not just sitting at my desk all day listening to him talk and laugh to himself.

I feel like there is something wrong with me,1,1.0,2024-06-14 05:26:45,"I really feel like there is something wrong with me. I don’t want to go down a list of things, but I feel like some of them are an important to mention.

I don’t know if this directly relates with the struggles I’m going through, but this had such a big impact on my life it’s definitely ntely worthy to mention.

When I was around 11 or 12, my mother and father got into a huge fight which resulted in my mother leaving my family with no forewarning to Ohio, where she stayed with her sister for a month. She blocked my brothers, me, and my father and refused to talk to my father. It hurt me a lot and I remember crying because I made her her favorite dish and bought her coffee so she can feel better when she came back.

I really have no idea why this affected me as much as I did. I can’t live my life in peace and even tho this incident happened years ago, I still think about it often and when I do it just brings me to tears.

I feel like it’s just me who is struggling with this because it doesn’t have seemed to affect my brother or my father.

But another big thing that happend was right after my mom got back, I was cooking some stew and I guess didn’t clean up my mess very well, because my mother and I got into a huge fight where she proceeded to yell at me and tell me that she wishes I was dead and that she wishes me to be 18 sooner so I can leave the house. I cried so hard after that. I still tear up about it when I think about it.

She also talked very openly and several times infront of my brothers and I about how she wanted to divorce my father and leave back to Korea. To this day she denies the part where she yelled at me where she wished I died, and telling me constantly how she wanted to divorce my dad.

Anyway, recently I’ve noticed a pattern in my behavior. I literally get such bad anxiety when I’m not around people. I need to be with a friend constantly, or be at a social setting or else I feel so alone and my anxiety flares up. The school season ended recently and I wake up with so much anxiety. It gets worse around the late afternoon before nighttime. This anxiety has been there for a while but it’s just recently where I have noticed this.

I also find myself using drugs and alcohol to alleviate the pain I feel. I just don’t know what this pain is exactly. I want to pin point exactly what’s causing this so I can just get rid of it but I just don’t know what it is.

Thoughts of suicide has crossed my mind multiple times, but I am religious and in my religion it is prohibited to be end myself. So I don’t. 

No one knows I’m struggling and I want to talk to someone but I’m just not brave enough. I feel like there’s something wrong with me. I don’t know what to do.

so lately i’ve been having panic attacks (whatever it is when you’re crying, laughing, hyperventilating, all that) around being scared of being sick/emetophobia and really in general for the past year and its exhausting because it physically takes so much and i can’t process my emotions enough to make it stop


i had gastritis and that’s given me fear of eating and getting sick for about a year. i can’t feel safe unless i have snacks that help with nausea, medicine, and wait at least 4 hours before going to bed

this on top of my summer (blues? depression idk) stuff is making me miserable. i’ve dealt with bullying and depression when i was 12 and since then i’ve been bad mentally and really insecure and suicidal to the point where i’ve developed anxiety around socializing, food, and general anything

im in therapy but its so hard to talk about this and hope she gets it. im always downplaying everything and i find it impossible to make it sounds like how it feels. bc i can say how it feels but it hurts much more than i can say it. my family has gotten better at seeing it but i still can’t make it clear enough. mostly cause i’ve developed a sort of happy persona where i cannot be sad unless i’m alone or panicking and can’t hold onto to pretending. its that or laughing when things get serious.

i just want normal things at this point. i want to drive and eat without being scared, and be with my friends, and all that. and i’m expected to act like an adult next year and i’m graduating. yet i have no life and im sheltered, sensitive and anxious about everything

(35M) Is my ADHD part of why I feel like I am hypersexual?,0,0.33,2024-06-14 04:44:56,"I'm struggling with what I believe is hypersexuality. I'm constantly feeling horny throughout the day, and it's starting to interfere with my daily life and responsibilities. This persistent sexual arousal is making it hard to focus on work, maintain relationships, and carry out everyday activities.

I've tried various methods to manage these feelings, such as exercise, meditation, and staying busy, but nothing seems to help. I understand that sexual desire is normal, but this level of intensity feels overwhelming and out of control.

I also have ADHD, and I'm unsure if this might be contributing to why I feel hypersexual or horny all the time. I've read that impulsivity and hyperfocus, which are common with ADHD, can sometimes manifest as increased sexual desire, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening in my case.

I'm looking for advice on how to cope with these feelings in a healthy way. Are there any strategies or treatments that can help reduce these urges? Should I consider seeing a therapist or a medical professional, and if so, what type of specialist would be best suited to help with this issue?

About 4 months ago I had one of my worst panic attacks resulting in my going to the ER as I completely shut down... (I had had minor ones a few different times but nth as bad as this). I passed it as soon as I went to the ER and was comforted by my family but I was still confused as to why I felt like I was going to die or have some heart attack (what it felt like lol). Ever since that day I struggled for months overthinking ""what if it happens again?"" ""What will I do if that panic attack happens again"" ""no one understands me"" ""I'm doomed I'll never feel normal again"" and over analyzed every. Single. Thing. About how I felt , acted ,etc . just to make sure that I wouldn't ever get a panic attack like that day I mentioned. And guess what? I never did have a panic attack ever since but instead passed through some health anxiety until eventually I got over that and got blood tested , ekg and all that  and realized I'm perfectly healthy and there's no reason to be worried and concerned as to why I had that panic attack and it indeed was just a episode.

NOW 
I'm doing (Thank God) much better;I have my off days (usually days when I'm sad or tired) , where I get a little anxious but it's more of a overthinking feeling as to where I'm over analyzing as to WHY I got that way those 4 months ago. Idk how to word it but it's like almost im traumatized from that panic attack and so disappointed that I let myself get like that and I catch my self remembering the feelings I had weeks after that panic attack in which I'd be depressed and uneasy. Again, I feel fine I just feel sad when I think about those days kind of like I can't get over that phase. I keep overthinking and sometimes worry like ""oh will that happen again?""

Again, I'm better now I really am it's just I wish I never had to go through that phase in my life. Does any one have any advice how to get over what happened and move on with my life?

I don't think I'm getting better,6,1.0,2024-06-13 18:10:48,"Hi, I'm turning 20 in November, yet I feel like there really isn't much to life. The idea of graduating with a degree, pursuing a career that I'm passionate about, building a family all seems so mundane to me.

I truly envy others who seemingly know what they're doing and wasting no time, thinking about useless stuff like what I'm doing to work towards their goals. I sound like a lazy person that's complaining about every minute thing right now, but the truth is I probably am. But I like to think that I've put an effort to not feel this way but yet I feel nothing.

I feel disconnected from everyone. Parents speak about trusting God and his plans. Good friends all have sound advice for me to deal with this feeling, however I've never been able to resonate with any of it. I'm truly lost. Perhaps I'm finding an excuse to working hard by feeling this way. Maybe not. Either way I'm feeling it.

I used to blame my parents for my upbringing. It may as well be their fault for me being like this. Eventually I've come to accept that holding it against them solves nothing, so I blame myself. I really see no possible future where I can love existing as  the person that I am. I have no idea who I am anymore. Everyday I have a hundred thoughts for every single thing I want to do. It's exhausting and I don't think I can do it anymore.

I'm scared of the pain of dying. But sometimes I wish I had the balls to do it. This whole life thing is not working out for me no matter what bullshit mindset I'm forcing myself to have. I'm gonna start praying I don't wake up the next day starting from tonight.

A lot to unwind.,1,1.0,2024-06-14 03:41:51,"

I’m a 17-year-old boy on a plane from New York to Chicago. My life truly began at 15 when I started asking questions and became self-aware. At 14, I watched ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" which changed my life. I wished I could be Spider-Man, sneaking out at night to climb buildings, hoping to become him. When I realized I couldn’t, I turned to making money. 

At 15, I struggled mentally, feeling like I was going insane. I buzzed my head and spent two summers working non-stop. My thoughts were so overwhelming that I'd run barefoot to Kendrick Lamar at 3-5 am. Last summer, as a sophomore, I felt fulfilled for the first time: working, running, and repeating the cycle. 

This junior year, I made a lot of money and can now travel and buy almost anything. But something is still missing; I never fulfilled my Spider-Man dream. It feels like I chased money because I couldn’t be Spider-Man. Now, at 17, time feels relentless, and I realize I took my struggles and time for granted. 

I went to New York, hoping for fulfillment, but it didn’t satisfy me as I thought it would. I can't believe time is passing; I thought I'd stay 15-16 forever. As I near the end of my teenage years, I never got to be a teenager in New York with cool spider friends or scale skyscrapers. The rest of my life seems destined to chase fulfillment through business and helping others, even though those stories aren’t as cool as being Spider-Man.

Can I become less emotionally numb and more empathetic or is this just my personality?,3,1.0,2024-06-13 20:08:58,"Hi everyone! I’m not sure if this is the right place but I could really use some advice as I’ve been trying to change this for years but feel stuck. I feel like I’ve always had a very dampened emotional experience compared to other people. I’m like the opposite of a sensitive person, I’m pretty indifferent to most things and nothing really bothers me or if they do I can get over it pretty quick. I do feel emotions but most of the time they’re not very strong or they pass very quickly. I’m pretty sure this is because of my worldview - I’m quite ‘existential’ bordering on nihilistic tbh and life feels meaningless. I feel like I’m always searching for ‘more’ from life and would describe living as boring, kind of like “is this it?” In that way I suppose I’m some version of depressed but atypically so. 

Anyway because I’m like this I find it really hard to relate to other people’s experiences which always seem to be quite emotionally charged. E.g. I’ve always found the notion of anxiety to be confusing as I can’t imagine caring about anything enough to be anxious about it. It simply is not that deep (to me).

15 Y/O Asynchronous Development Questions,3,1.0,2024-06-13 19:45:44,"Ever since I was a kid, my brain has been wired for curiosity, and I’ve always loved learning through hands-on experiences. Now, as a high school student, I see myself as different from my peers. While the typical ’s underclassmen's life revolves around school, video games, sports, and friends, I’m the opposite. I gravitate towards activities usually associated with 'adult work'. I enjoy learning how to wire a house with electricity, plumb a shed, configure an AV system for a home theater, or maintain a pool system and everything else in this sort.

I’ve always been comfortable speaking with adults and have never felt a strong desire to make friends or socialize with people my age. Sports and video games have never interested me much. Despite my hands-on skills and problem-solving abilities, I sometimes feel a step behind in school. I’m confident in myself—not socially awkward, just a quiet, smart (ish) kid. I rarely feel embarrassed by having different views from my peers, and I don’t have a deep desire to form friendships. Whereas I will always gravitate to humans that share the same skill sets as me. This is why I think I socialize with adults better.

Seeking Advice: How to Help a Parent Obsessed with Alternative Therapies and Misinformation,1,1.0,2024-06-14 01:35:21,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m deeply concerned about my mother’s behavior and I’m not sure how to handle it. Over the past few years, she has become increasingly obsessed with alternative therapies and health misinformation she finds online. She constantly complains about various health issues that no doctor has been able to diagnose, and as a result, she avoids traditional medical care altogether.

Instead, she spends a lot of time researching and trying out various alternative therapies like chlorine dioxide, biomagnetism, and even urine therapy. She’s also heavily involved in online groups that promote these practices and buys into remote therapies and dubious treatments from so-called ""doctors"" she meets online.

She’s completely distrustful of vaccines and mainstream medicine, frequently shares misinformation, and tries to convince others to adopt her beliefs. I’ve tried reasoning with her and presenting scientific information, but nothing seems to work.

Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you manage to help your loved one? Any advice or strategies would be greatly appreciated.

However, although my life and outlook on life comes from a much sincerer and mostly positive place there’s some issues pressing on me. 

I feel somewhat hardened. As though the pain I’ve endured (and am continuing to endure in the case of my family) has wrapped me up in a protective shell, which is in many ways a fantastic thing. 

I feel much more capable of protecting myself from people emotionally and just in general at the moment, I feel very strong. The downside is I’m having a little trouble letting a whole lot in. 

I’m struggling to connect with people truly, to let down that defensive barrier and let in love. 

I’m not sure how much of this is just the human condition, some Buddhist general “life is suffering” type deal, if I’ve become slightly deharmonised from life or if this is just the bittersweet curse of aging and growth.

Whatever it is, I’ve gotta say. Not a fan.

Igroring or accepting?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 00:35:25,"Hello, let's start by saying that I am a nationalist and there are people that make fun of my country on Instagram and IRL. I was so tired of these people that I started to make an IG account and try to modernize my country's language all by myself. I also took a step further and tried to make an account that makes propaganda videos against the opponent country.

Yet the opponent country is more powerful in this electronic battle of people. When I look at my people, I see they are sad enough to handle them, but I know in the depths of my heart that I cannot do anything by myself for my country, yet I do things that no one will do.

I can't sleep till late hours, something around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., and all I think about is how to free my country from the sh\*t government, make my people happy, and shut down those who hate us. I dream that my country will become modern and powerful enough to play a role in the this century. I also dream about myself becoming an example in the history of the world, a good person that everyone will remember.

Yet dreaming all that looks too far for me.

Sometimes I get so angry that I like to kill someone from the opponent country to satisfy myself, and sometimes I even don't want to go too far and I want to beat those who I hate daily, yet they are in front of me.

Everyone finds me strange for doing that, yet I feel like I have a role in all these sh\*t politics.

Why am I indifferent about everything?,1,1.0,2024-06-14 00:04:57,"It's a question I ask myself for the last 5-7 years. Is it bad to not be bothered about anything? I'm 24 now but I feel like I always have felt indifferent about pretty much anything. I like some things, I have hobbies and things I wanna become but I'm not obsessed about anything. I like my hobbies but if for some reason I stopped tomorrow, I would be perfectly fine. All of the people I know have something that they say they cannot live without. It's not the same with me. I may like something but deep down I don't really care about it. It's not the end of the world for me if I can't do it for some reason. 

Also I have never felt emotions that deeply. I've loved someone some years back and I still love them, but I can still live my life without them so I don't mind. Even family members. I love them and I don't want something bad to happen to them, but even if something happens, serious or not, I need to really push myself to remember to care about them. 

Also on the topic of death, I feel totally ok with it. Even when I lost my grandparents, I pushed myself to cry so that others can see that I care. But I wasn't feeling anything. I didn't feel sad, happy, anger. I didn't feel anything.

A lot of times I think that I don't feel that much. Maybe I know how I should feel but in the end of the day I don't care that much. It won't change the universe whatever happens.

advice for dealing with financial debt with severe depression,1,1.0,2024-06-13 23:55:04,"hi guys. i was debating on even posting this because it genuinely it is one of the most embarrassing and shameful things for me to admit and i don't want people to ever find me saying this on the internet - but i figured since no one even knows i use this account i figured why not ask now and then delete it later.

but regardless, i need serious advice.  

how do you recover from being financially unstable and in debt? i have a full time job already but it's just not cutting it...and i'm looking for a 2nd part-time job but i've had zero luck so far because they need people who will be more flexible with their schedule, and because i already work 8-5, it's hard to find jobs that i can work at in the evening (without it being a fast food restaurant). 

my parents weren't ever really involved in my life and they never really explained the importance of being financially stable, being responsible with your credit card, etc. they aren't really supportive of my mental health either which is why i decided to post it here instead of some financial subreddit. if there's another place i can post this pls lmk.

but anyways, i let it get this bad because my depression is just...so severe. and because my parents are so freakishly unsupportive of anything that's remotely close to mental illness, i've been untreated and i've only seen about 2 therapists both of which have flopped. i did however see a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with bpd and ocd. i'm 22 years old. i've dealt with emotionally and mentally abusive parents for 10+ years, and i've dealt with very toxic relationships that have drained me of me of my money. 

last year i was very very suicidal and had a clear vision in my mind i was going to commit suicide by the end of 2023, and for months i was VERY set on my decision. so i spent way too much money especially on my credit card because in my head i was going to kill myself anyways so there was no point in me trying to get ahold of myself. i've thought about it many many times but i was 100% set with a plan to die at the end of 2023 since i have had nothing to live for, even myself. i made a lot of dumb decisions financially because i truly believed it was the end of my life and i was honestly okay with that. 

obviously now it's june 2024 and things have happened and i'm still alive and somehow surviving. i'm somewhat better than before, considering i've been in a really healthy relationship that's given me some purpose, but i'm still not okay at all. especially now dealing with the repercussions and consequences of my own actions. i work full time monday-friday but the money i make right now isn't enough to cover the debt i have. i babysit every now and then and i'm trying to look for a secondary job but i've had no luck so far. and i'm scared of overworking myself because then i'm really just never gonna prioritize myself at all. i want to move out and better myself (especially since the household i live in is one of the reasons i'm so fucked in the head) but i have no money in my savings because everything just goes towards my credit card and obviously my credit card debt is more than i can handle.

i'm just really stuck. i'm not here to beg for money and i will never ask, all i'm asking for is help and a direction on what to do. i have nobody in my life i can turn to about this and i just don't know what to do.

I feel like some of this is unusual but some isn't, recognise that many people have their own battles to fight, or, just cope with.

"Suddenly, I feel empty",1,1.0,2024-06-13 23:25:41,"Today it’s my 20th birthday (not really, it’s past midnight, *yesterday* was my 20th birthday). The night before I felt so much anxiety that I broke down and cried. I’m 20 and have no irl friends. I’m 20 and have never been in a relationship. I’m 20 and I’ve never had a job. I’m 20 and, fuck, what have I achieved? An online friend posted a pic of herself after a gym pass in a discord server. People complimented her (called her attractive, it’s between friends and all in good tones). No-one’s *ever* said that about me. That I’m attractive. Or pretty. Or cute. Or complimented my appearance in any way other than a purely friendly and non-romantic way.

I struggle a lot with my self-confidence. It’s hard to not see your entire existence as an odd and unnatural, perhaps even accidental, spot in the world. If I have no friends, and if the only person who loves me is my own mom, surely I’m the problem? Something must be wrong with *me*.

Anyway. I got money for my birthday and in a desperate attempt to strangle my anxiety, I brought video games. Lots of them. I brought 11 DLC’s for this game I’ve been playing a lot recently (the DLC’s were on sale… I brought all of the ones I didn’t have). It didn’t take long before my entire body just… itched to get as far away from my computer as possible. Suddenly the game wasn’t even remotely fun, in fact nothing was. I felt like a tornado of anxiety was going on a rampage in my head. I couldn’t sit still and relax, I just couldn’t, I literally began pacing around the room.

Skip ahead another hour, I manage to sit down in my bed and calm down. Now I feel a weird emptiness instead. I’ve felt it before, but only two other times that I can recall. Both appeared after an extremely intense breakdown, kind of like I drained my entire system of any and all feelings. I was neither happy nor sad. I wasn’t angry, I wasn’t worried, I wasn’t anything. An empty shell staring off into space without even having a particular opinion on what to eat for dinner.

Now it’s happened again and I have no idea how to make it go away. I stupidly brought even more video games, anything to make me feel something, all I ended up with was anxiety for spending my money. So much for being an adult, I’ve already wasted god knows how much on video games today… and I don’t even want to play them.",mentalhealth,Round_Associate_8136,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfcsog/suddenly_i_feel_empty/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

Big psychological problems since childhood - I want to find what I have...,1,1.0,2024-06-13 23:14:13,"Hi there!

I'm a French student. This is the first time I'm posting on an English-speaking sub (sorry in advance for my English, by the way). 

To sum up my problem, I feel like my whole being is based on psychological problems, and I still don't know the source of these problems.

I started having a lot of OCD at the age of 11. For reasons I won't go into here, I had horrible school hours (7.30 a.m. - 6.15 p.m.), and when I got home, I'd eat a little and work (homework) until 11 p.m.. 

I've done nothing but work all my life, I think because it was the only thing I felt respected for. In fact, despite all these years of working like crazy, I've always had a lot of trouble concentrating. 

Often when I'm working, I feel pressure in the back of my head, and I get stressed/ intrusive thoughts. When I do something well, I have a little voice in my head telling me ""that's good"" but to put pressure on me and I find it even harder to concentrate.

Today is my 22nd birthday, and I have the feeling that chemically, my brain doesn't want to allow me to be happy. I still have this permanent pressure in my head, this feeling of being limited in what I have to do, and I'd like to know where it comes from, what causes it?

Residential care for 8-year-old with pediatric bipolar?,3,1.0,2024-06-13 17:01:00,"My 8-year-old son has been struggling with mental illness for a couple of years now, and after several psychiatrists, medication regimens, and fruitless therapy sessions, we are looking at residential programs. This is an incredibly hard decision, but he has become violent, actually injuring me (his father), his mom, and his older brother many times. Property destruction is in the thousands at this point. Last week he began threatening self-harm, and at that point I began to surrender to the inevitability of hospitalization. 

He's been diagnosed with pediatric bipolar disorder, but as you know, psychiatric diagnoses pre-puberty are dicey. At the very least, I can say that he becomes explosively angry over unpredictable things (i.e. his pajamas are in the wash, his cat doesn't come when called, we're out of bananas). He has also begun sobbing fits over similarly unpredictable matters -- not just fit-pitching, but episodes that look like a grieving child. His last month of the school year was marred by a dozen absences when he simply refused to go -- crawling under his bed crying. When we actually made it to school, he frequently vomited (I'm pretty sure he has learned to throw up at will), and we had no choice but to pick him up. Needless to say, the outlook isn't auspicious.

I won’t go on for too long I hope, but when I was 12 he introduced me to my third step mother (his third relationship since he and my mum divorced when I was 5). 

She was nice at first but I always felt something off about her. She went on to be emotionally abusive, cruel and manipulative for the entirety of their relationship until six months ago, when she up and left out of absolutely nowhere. 

I have experienced a lot of abandonment and abrupt change in my life, when my other step mums left, through various other family conflicts, and this time too - my dad and her have a child together, my sweet youngest brother. She also had two younger children who were my step siblings for 7 years. Her cruel parents also lived with us for the majority of their relationship and they are now gone too. 

I can’t feel emotional about it… I don’t feel any emotional attachment or sentiment to the whole situation. 

I can’t even really process the traumas I went through but all I know is that I feel like I am avoiding even trying. 

I had a lot of physical, emotional and sexual abuse through this time, I also dealt with depression and very high levels of anxiety due to significant traumas I witnessed and experienced, however I  had to always keep my thoughts and feelings hidden to avoid conflict between the family as she was very controlling and I was forbid to speak up.  

Why don’t I feel sad or angry or hurt? I feel nothing, it feels like nothing ever happened.

For my career choice I’m going to study physics and I feel much the same. I do absolutely love to learn about the universe and its laws. I find it endlessly fascinating, but I’m definitely not the smartest person in our school. I likely won’t discover quantum gravity, or anything significant and likely just contribute nothing.

My point is that it bothers me. I find it repulsive to be normal and it’s been damaging me my entire life, I’m unable to form relationships, fall in love, and stick with anything because I’ve given up on the normal despite knowing I’m not a savant but yet I’m emotionally pretending to be one. I’m graduating high school now, my last day was a few days ago and I’m driving myself insane, everywhere I look I see people with potential so high, with a fire so deep. Yet I’m wasting away typing on my phone on a post no-one is going to read because I don’t know what the hell I’m going to do, I scorned my ability to be normal despite lacking the talent to justify it.

I can’t anymore ,1,1.0,2024-06-13 21:37:14,"I am always the one in the family who has EVER de-escalated an argument. Proof of Thur 13th June (yesterday as of writing) argument is enough as even when I was broken beyond belief I still tried to de-escalate but can’t when I am the focal point of the argument. This is further proof I can never open up my true feelings to either of my family as an argument happens 

Before you say that is a lie or even think of denying it just think who you go to in the house when you’re annoyed, frustrated or dealing with an issue. That’s right me. I am sure you noticed that when I am the focal point of an argument it escalates as without me to de-escalate no “peace occurs”.

Dad you say you want to keep the peace then please learn to de-escalate and not escalate like you always do. Don’t think of denying it as when amber and you argued you wanted to call the police and without me there you would have called the police as you wanted which would have made things worse. 

You dare say I have no empathy when I not only have my emotions and issues weighing on me but yours amber and all my friends. Not even starting to grace the pain and sorrow i went through with mum and as you guessed whenever around mum I was the one de-escalating. 

I am never able to say why I am truly always on my phone and until now I couldn’t give a true reason but deep down I knew why. Well after the recent argument with you I know why as you distract myself from all the dark emotions I have. 

I can never speak to anyone in this house about anything I am thinking of and never plan to as I have too much of a burden that you don’t even realise. Just as I was writing this you came upstairs to “talk” but all it was, was mainly you making it worse with you claiming you were de-escalating a potential future argument with amber and myself but nope you weren’t even if you think you were. To de-escalate you would need a calm face to start but the face you gave then was the complete opposite. You looked at me with a face of disgust and anger nowhere near calm. It is no fault of your own as from what you told me at a young age you weren’t able to learn how to calmly de-escalate an argument.

I feel like I am being judged at every given point in my life!!!,1,1.0,2024-06-13 20:08:40,"I have come to a point in my life where I am stuck with the feeling that I am being judged no matter what I do. To give a little insight on my upbringing and current situation, I was raised in a religious household, dragged to church every Sunday morning, night, and most Wednesday nights. Through these experiences I remember a threat that was held over my head throughout childhood. Something along the lines of if I don't do right by the Lord I'm going to hell. This has put me in a position where I don't want anything to do with religion because I feel like no matter what I do I will be judged, but as I've taken time and given myself space away from that subject I don't feel any better. There is still something in the back of my mind that says ""watch out serious platypus, you don't want to end up in hell."" This judgment comes from everywhere whether or not it is actually true is a different story.

I know a lack of self-esteem can be a major cause of this as well as social anxiety which is something that I have been diagnosed with. I've been speaking to my therapist about this situation as well, and today I was requested to seek out answers from somewhere online. Reddit is the first place I thought about going because my name is obviously not Serious Platypus so it is a little easier to open up here. 

  
I've always wanted to know what I want to do with my life, since Elementary school if I remember right. The early years were so exciting because I would share my writing with anybody and everybody who wanted to read what I've created. These experiences grew, and as I fought through the troubles of childhood, clinging on to writing I eventually came to a point that sent me on a downward spiral...

I remember the day that my passion for letting people read what I have written was stopped dead in it's tracks. As childish as it sounds, there was a girl in school that liked, and she wanted me to write something for her. So I did. After school that day she read what I wrote, and ripped it up in front of me and just dropped it like it was nothing. I feel like my confidence in writing and self esteem in general was crushed at that point, and ever since then (it's been a while) I've been struggling with putting words on paper that I am proud of, or that I feel like won't get torn up in front of my eyes. But here I am reaching out for help.

How do I rekindle my self-esteem and not feel like I am being judged at every corner of my life? And most importantly, how do I reignite the passion that I once had instead of just sitting around and waiting for the end. I know I have just written a lot, but I feel like I am in the bottom of a well trying to climb out with no rope or footholds.

"Feeling lonely, depressed, and with intrusive thoughts about the past",1,1.0,2024-06-13 20:05:42,"I grew up in an abusive household. My father for sure is a narcissist. I put up with a lot during my childhood and eventually realized that my only way out was college. When time to apply to colleges arrived, I applied to universities that were far away from home. I did not have any support from family members from the moment I moved away for college. Not once did my parents or any family members visited me in college. I recently graduated from professional school and only a friend went to my graduation.

While I have been able to get ahead educationally and likely have a successful career ahead of me, I feel like emotionally I am in shambles. It's difficult to see my friends and peers being so close with their families while I don't have anyone to rely on. While I have friends, I am an introvert and easily mistrust other people. The only semblance of a stable family I ever had was my ex-spouse's. We got together when we were undergrads and split up about two years ago. While my ex has their own share of problems, they put up with my lack of trust for many years, which undoubtedly had a negative impact on the relationship. I've been to therapy and worked through those issues. However, no matter how much I accomplish in life, I feel pretty unfulfilled and lonely, in great part because of the void of not having family members who truly care about me.

Instead, what I have is memories of the abuse. I have only seen my father once since 2010 (and that one time I saw him was only for a couple of hours) but call him occasionally. Whenever I bring up the abuse, he either says he doesn't remember or says something like, ""if you are still resentful about the past, free to pretend I don't exist. What happened to you is nothing compared to what I went through as a child.""

On the ouside I seem like a person who is put together and who has a brilliant life ahead of them, but inside I am in constant agony. I also have dreadful thoughts (like, if something happened to me I would be completely on my own). I am on meds and have been to therapy for years.

"Girlfriend sleepwalking, tryed to run away at night, what should i do? ",0,0.5,2024-06-13 19:44:27,"My girlfriend f24 told me she is sleepwalking at night sometimes, but i never experienced it before. The relationship is still new and we are on holiday together right now. So i just experienced it for the first time and don't know how to react. 

We were sleeping cuddled together in bed,  i woke up because my arm fell asleep from cuddeling so i tryed to move it. 

That startled her. She jumped up from bed, made loud noises that were not understandable, but she clearly panicked and ran to the door. To note, this all happened in 1-2 seconds, very fast. She was 100% sleeping and not moving at all before this happened. 

I was shocked myself and didn't understand what is going on and how to react at first. I catched her before she left the hotelroom and tryed to calm her down. First she tryed to fight me but she quickly calmed down and fell asleep immidiatly again.

Today i talked with her about this and she can not remember anything but she had a similair thing happen to her in the past, one time she tryed to run to the forest in the middle of the night but her mom catched her before she left the property of their house. 

Can this be a mental condition? How should i handle this?

I didn't expect her to really try to run all of a sudden, if she really leave the hotelroom it will be difficult to find her, espescially when I am asleep when this happens the next time. i think it will also be dangerouse for herself since she don't remember anything, maybe she will run on a busy street or get lost in a foregin country. 

I think she has some other mental problems too, but i still did not confirm them.  One of them is probably an eating disorder since she feels stomach ache every time she eats a little more food. But she eats very little food all the time, it is impossible to feel full with this, she is also very skinny and underweight. She also feels the urge to throw up after eating more that she is used too, i asked her about this but she say this just started recently and it will go away soon...",mentalhealth,Artistic-Cap-121,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1df7t2t/girlfriend_sleepwalking_tryed_to_run_away_at/,3,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was abused by my brother up until I was 12 and started fighting back. I lost my great grandmother, my parent, from cancer 3 years ago, and everything has gone to hell since. I tried to kill myself due to her husband being horrible to me and doing a mess of weird things. I 'ran away' to a friend's house to get away from him, there I got assaulted repeatedly for the two weeks I was there. 

I was forced back home after that and a few months later it actually clicked that what had happened was rape. I tried reporting him, hiss word against mine, nothing happened. Then December of 22 my great grandma's husband molested me in my sleep. I left. Stayed with a friend for a month, then lived with my sister from January of last year until July. There, I watched and heard her and her husband argue all day, even in front of their child who wasn't even 2 yet. She wound up physically hurting him and then she left.

I have not had an easy life, I have a lot of trauma, a few mental illnesses, and some physical problems.

I can't afford driving school, I can't afford new clothes, I can't afford to get my ged, the only reason I can get food is through food stamps.

"Feeling lonely, depressed, and with intrusive thoughts about the past",1,1.0,2024-06-13 18:12:46,"I grew up in an abusive household. My father for sure is a narcissist. I put up with a lot during my childhood and eventually realized that my only way out was college. When time to apply to colleges arrived, I applied to universities that were far away from home. I did not have any support from family members from the moment I moved away for college. Not once did my parents or any family members visited me in college. I recently graduated from professional school and only a friend went to my graduation.

While I have been able to get ahead educationally and likely have a successful career ahead of me, I feel like emotionally I am in shambles. It's difficult to see my friends and peers being so close with their families while I don't have anyone to rely on. While I have friends, I am an introvert and easily mistrust other people. The only semblance of a stable family I ever had was my ex-spouse's. We got together when we were undergrads and split up about two years ago. While my ex has their own share of problems, they put up with my lack of trust for many years, which undoubtedly had a negative impact on the relationship. I've been to therapy and worked through those issues. However, no matter how much I accomplish in life, I feel pretty unfulfilled and lonely, in great part because of the void of not having family members who truly care about me.

Instead, what I have is memories of the abuse. I have only seen my father once since 2010 (and that one time I saw him was only for a couple of hours) but call him occasionally. Whenever I bring up the abuse, he either says he doesn't remember or says something like, ""if you are still resentful about the past, free to pretend I don't exist. What happened to you is nothing compared to what I went through as a child.""

On the ouside I seem like a person who is put together and who has a brilliant life ahead of them, but inside I am in constant agony.

-I have problems with memory, I always forget important stuff unless I write stuff down 50 times and screenshot it and make it my wallpaper I won’t remember it.

-I neglect self-care, such as brushing my teeth, washing my sheets, or cleaning my room, likely due to depression.

What is cyber/gangstalking?,1,1.0,2024-06-13 16:41:52,"Context: I am Canadian, and for those of whom are living outside of Canada, we are implementing a rather dubious and cynical practice called “M.A.I.D.”. Medical Assistance In Dying.

A friend of mine who I’ve not spoken to since high school has been dealing with what he calls Gang Stalking or Cyber Stalking. It is essentially the belief that he is living the life of Jim Carey in the movie The Truman Show. The belief that everyone is an actor and all interactions are tests performed by a powerful entity.

He fantasizes of MAID but is currently unable to receive it because it’s not outlined in law that people with this mental illness are eligible for it.
———————————

Question #1 : How should I (or anyone) deal with someone who is exhibiting this illness? 

I have already told him that I am on the side him, the part that is aimed up, so I will not rally for amendments with MAID (I would not rally for it for anyone. No one should have a ‘compassionate killing from the government’).

Question #2 : (context) He is also atheistic, which I also was for 15 years, but I’ve come to learn that reality isn’t only made up of facts and matter, but also how to act in the world. What is the world made of vs how to act in the world. He has done something that strongly goes against the moral order (not murder, but I should not share) which I feel he is having a hard time processing as he does not have and has not had the proper moral framework to deal with the evils of the world and within each person individually, including himself. 

(Question) Does the lack of a moral order outside of one’s self create the environment where you could be subject to an OCD/Bipolar/Schizophrenic state? Due to the fact that it can be absolutely terrifying to realize the evil capacity within one’s self? As opposed to the atheist claim along the lines of ‘we’re all basically good, just be good and everything will be alright’.

This doesn’t make sense to me,1,1.0,2024-06-13 16:20:51,"My former therapist basically described to me that, without meds, me trying to better myself is the equivalent of ‘trying to swim to shore with only one available arm.” Like, as I interpret it, its very VERY difficult to do. Still doable, but barely. He was making it sound like it’s nearly an impossible feat to better myself without meds. 
If this is the case, then why was he still basically pushing the idea of me bettering myself on my own? Like he was telling me to go to IOP and work on myself there. Without meds basically. But didn’t he just tell me that bettering myself without meds is very hard? If so then why are all these professionals downplaying meds so much when someone like me clearly needs them AND therapy (trust me, if you knew me, you’d know I need a boost from meds to be able to better myself. That’s how badly I’m doing with my mental health). 

Maybe he encouraged me to do IOP even without meds because he was able to do it himself. But my problems seem to be more complex than his were before he was able to better himself.

I've been riddled with guilt and feeling terrible about myself.,1,1.0,2024-06-13 16:15:32,"My mental health is really up and down at the minute. I've got a 5 month old baby, and my mother recently passed away which could be contributing, but Ive been obsessing over guilty thoughts of basically all the bad things I've ever done and feel like  a terrible person. 
The main thing I'm obsessing over which causes me great shame and guilt is from a couple of years ago. In work (while in my current relationship, we have 2 kids together) I became quite infatuated with a colleague who is married. One day he held the lift for me and called me over. I thought nobody was around, and there was definitely some flirtatious body language and eye contact between us. It would have looked like we were about to kiss if someone saw us. It turns out someone did and he used every occasion since to make thinly veiled comments about it and it was clear he was trying to makee feel ashamed and for all I know he thinks we were having some kind of affair. The man involved started receiving these comments too from the other colleague, and became very hostile towards me and then moved to another team. I feel so dreadful and idiotic about the whole thing and I feel like I've gotten mysef a reputation as some sort of dangerous homewrecker, though I have no evidence anyone has been gossiping about it. I wish I could go back and change my interaction with him that day. I've never cheated in my life and it would never have come to that. I suppose I was just in need of some male attention as things were up and down with my partner at times, but we're in such a good place now. He supported me through losing my mum, was my rock, and we have another child together since. But the regret is eating me up and I'm wrried gossip has spread and will affect my career the rest of my life. 
I am going to seek therapy but would really appreciate any comments that might help me to move on from this.

But this is very painfull and I am literally paralysed by fear. I am not able to think in head a way where I actually prepare for my phD applications and get accepted.

During my 11th and 12th grade I chose to prepare for a competitive exam to get into the college i want. My parents spent a lot of money, I sat in classes for a lot of time literally locked myself up in my room from morning 5 30 till night 10 to study. But inside that room i would just ruminate and worry about the fact how getting good grades and clearing the exam isn't going to make me better at science and research, or make me more creative, which is what I wanted. In the end I did nothing all day towards either of these goals and just shut off my brain and watched TV.

By some luck i got into a different but pretty good university and next year I will be graduating with my masters. I really want to pursue phD and work towards mastery in science and be creative and build a passionate career. But fear of failure and anxiety about the repeat of my past is scaring me.

I’m so depressed I have no motivation to eat,3,1.0,2024-06-13 09:27:58,"Sorry for the long post, it’s mostly me ranting about my life. I could really use someone to talk to.


I’m going through the worst part of my life. My boyfriend who I have an extremely strong relationship with has decided to go into the military. His training is 8 months long, I got to see him 2 months in and then 4 months in, but now the last 4 I won’t see him at all. I can’t even speak to him because he’s not allowed his phone. I’ve had severe attachment issues my whole life and have probably cried a total of imma say 100 hours over this. I used to have really bad panic attacks. 

Found out a few months after my boyfriend left that my only grandparent, that I’m close with suddenly has stage 4 lung cancer and has 3 months left to live. She was in remission and considered cancer free last summer and then bam. She’s going downhill so fast, they just put her on the oxygen mask and it’s terrifying. This is the first death I will have to deal with ever and I don’t know how I’m going to get through it without my person with me. 

A few weeks ago I stopped being friends with my only friend because she hasn’t given me any support whatsoever in the past 4 months. I have to beg her to hangout with me even though she’s my literal next door neighbour. On top of that I work 50 hours a week and she works 15 and yet she can’t find time for me. 

I live with my two sisters, niece, and mom. My one sister which is my best friend works the opposite shift as me so we don’t see eachother at all, only on weekends. I get off late and when I get home everyone’s usually asleep or too tired to spend time with me. I’m constantly alone. I have no one to text, and can’t make friends that I feel comfortable with. I just hate people and always feel judged so I don’t like letting people in, I’ve also never met anyone other than my partner that GENUINELY is interested in me as a person and deeply cares for me. I just miss him so much. 

And the cherry on top is how much I hate my fucking job but can’t leave it because I won’t get the kind of pay I do anywhere else. I work so far from home and am constantly gone, when I’m home I deprive myself of basic needs such as eating because I don’t want to waste my free time, I’m also chronically lazy. If I didn’t have to look presentable for work I’d probably shower once a week. I also rarely have an appetite and actually have a hard time eating in general because I’m always running on empty. I usually eat once every two days, I try to go for atleast once a day which is good for me but only if it’s a full meal, which it usually isn’t. 

I’m not constantly sad, but everytime I’m alone and have time to think, I am. Even the small things like how I’m too lazy to eat make me extra sad because it feels pathetic. And just extremely depressing. I’ve lost 20 pounds since my boyfriend left. I honestly just want someone to talk to me and try to support me and maybe give me some ideas on how to get my shit together. Even if you can’t give me any help/advice, support would be nice. I honestly even feel pathetic posting this because I know what I’m going through isn’t that bad, but I just genuinely have no one to talk to and really needed to type it all out for someone to read and understand. There’s honestly so much more but I’d probably end up writing an essay so I’m gonna stop here.

My sister was the one changing my diapers and cooking me meals because our mother was out drinking or doing whatever. She had major anger issues, always lashed out at us. She cheated on every man she was with, always focused on herself or the men in her life instead of us. She would leave us alone for days at a time to fend for ourselves.

Thought I witnessed my cat die,1,1.0,2024-06-13 14:52:43,"I was coming home late from the gym the other night, and saw a fox biting on a cat in the middle of the road , so ran over and scared the fox off. Looked down and noticed  (at that moment) it was my cat. Neck sliced and blood pouring out, motionless but she was still warm. It was around midnight, and so nobody was around, and I didn't know what to do. I felt myself start to tear up, gently stroking her, apologising for not getting there quicker, apologising for not letting her on my lap the previous day. She looked so defenseless and harmless laying there, and it didn't make sense that something so cute and harmless had such a violent exit in the world. I started to cry, because of what she went through, and how guilty I felt, and how much is will hurt my family when I tell them. 
I stood over her, diverting the odd car that came by. Some people stopped and asked, I answered, and they showed compassion, and I felt bad that they felt bad they couldn't 'help'.
After about 15 minutes standing over her in the rain, I mustered up the courage to take my jumper off and pick her up to carry her home. 
After a few attempts, and constantly muttering 'sorry' to her, I carried her back home. She was the daughter of our older cat, and I was terrified to go into the house and bring this news. 
I went in, went upstairs and woke my parents up as I didn't know what to do, through whimpers and light cries, I told them I found her dead on the street (all whilst holding her in the dark in my arms). They were obviously confused and upset, and we went downstairs, only to find my cat by the backdoor- pawing to get out. I realised I had brought a random dead cat home. Laughing, crying, confused, angry, stunned. I was feeling everything. 
Very fortunate that it was not my cat, but very sorry that it was someone else's. 
I had felt like I had to go through the stages of grief just to pick her up and carry her home and move forwards, only to find out that it wasn't my cat. 

After calming down, and questioning whether I'm an idiot for not recognising it wasn't my cat, I showed a picture to my family, and they were all certain they would have mistaken her for our cat aswell. 

I didnt realise I felt so strongly for my pet. I knew I cared and loved her etc, but it was a large shock to what extent. Perhaps it was the situation that made it worse. 

This happend 3 days ago, and still I don't feel emotionally back to normal. 
I kept telling myself when I was out there in the road, trying to pick her up, that it's 'just a cat', 'just pick her up', 'stop being overdramatic and just do it, you can't leave her out here'. 

Don't really know why I'm posting it here, but it was just such a huge emotional roller coaster, and I just needed to vent it. ",mentalhealth,Look_Beneath,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1df0whb/thought_i_witnessed_my_cat_die/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

Growing up, I was always adjusting to everyone and aside from food, clothes and school, I don't have anything. Basically, I don't have any priorities like my peers.

This is actually messed up but because my dad has anxiety disorder and also have a specially abled brother, all the attention was onto them and i was just going through the flow.

Was I wrong for telling my doctor I have an eating disorder?,1,1.0,2024-06-13 13:13:13,"Hello everybody,

So today I had a doctors appointment to re- go over some labs that had been ongoing on in attempts to get my hypothyroidism under control, as well as my high cholesterol. My doctor originally sent me a referral to a nutritionist, who I met up with to discuss a plan of action. I left the nutritionist appointment feeling highly discouraged and overall, checked out. During this appointment I discussed with the nutritionist that I would mainly like to focus on disordered eating, and focusing on eating more protein and getting into a better food routine. The nutritionist stated that disordered eating ""Was all in your head"" and then proceeded to focus on dieting to lose weight, which I told them, I wanted my interest to be on eating healthier, not losing weight. I told my primary doctor about this, and my concerns about having an eating disorder. She asked what eating disorder I had and told her I had binge eating disorder, and told her I was unable to work on it further because of the pandemic, and because I was recieving free therapy through my college, I was taken off the list because I was not actively suicidal. What I did not tell my doctor, was that I originally started seeing a therapist for high anxiety and depression, and that the topic of body dismorphia and eating disorders came up later, and briefly because the pandemic started in the following weeks. I was not formally diagnosed for anything, but my therapist and psychiatrist were pushing for depression and anxiety meds. In terms of having an eating disorder,  this is something I've been struggling with since I was 12 years old. Was I in the wrong for doing this? Am I faking an eating disorder? Should I have pushed for a formal diagnosis?

I can’t hold down a job,5,1.0,2024-06-13 04:50:58,"I have always been a “gifted kid” and I have heard all about gifted kid burnout, but I feel like such a complete failure, it can’t be normal.

I graduated from college in 2023 and since then things have just gone downhill. I got a great job at a school in a big city, lasted a month and a half. Got a job at a doctors office as a receptionist/scheduler, lasted about 5 months. I just left the first day of my new job a couple hours in because I can’t do it. Every time, I left abruptly with no warning and so obviously can’t use those jobs as references.

I just. Can’t. Do. It. I know I’m being childish and stupid and let things get to me too easily. Obviously, almost no one likes their job. But, I don’t know how they then have the ability to know they have to get up, day after day, and go do something they can’t look forward to. 

I’ve tried looking online for ways to help, but a lot of them are “set goals.” I am always able to talk myself out of goals. I either say they are unreasonable, or that I can get them some other way.

how to stop genuinely caring what other people think,1,0.67,2024-06-13 12:13:33,"I am having a hard time to really not care about what other people think of me - or what I believe other people think about me. To be clear, I am not speaking about situations or aspects where it would be 'normal' to care what other people think (in the sense that almost every human being would care).

Instead, I am speaking about situations where another person's opinion 'shouldn't' matter. E.g. if I have a hobby, I am afraid other people think I suck at it. Due to this, I am afraid to e.g. play an instrument in front of other people, because I am afraid they will judge me. If I imagine this judgement, I also ruminate about it and feel anxious / like a loser.

Another example: I don't get along with my coworkers so well and really don't like them (among others because they make racist and homophobic remarks, but also because we don't match in terms of age and lifestyle). Due to this, I keep to myself at work. Especially the nasty remarks make it feel 'unsafe' to self-disclose around them, as I have a history of being bullied. Still, despite the fact that I don't like them and also see them as pathetic, I still worry about their opinion a lot - e.g. that they think I am an awkward loser without social skills.

"How to process my failures, if these are really failures? ",2,1.0,2024-06-13 08:24:29,"Hi,

So my issues are very complex. Sometimes I can't decide if I'm a cool ""rockstar"", or a complete failure. Because we/I can see these situations in a very bright way as well. But I can see my life in the complete opposite way too. And sometimes I feel that it's a failure in reality, or at least not a really successful life. And I don't know what is the reality. And if its really a complete failure, then should I fix some stuff very quickly, because if not, something even worse would happen, or if everything is perfect in this way. So please help me see the situations more clearly.

**Studies:**

Positive:

During my university, I have achieved lot of awards, I had fame and glory, teachers praised me, I had invited to meetings with the leadership of the university, along with other 1-2 students, etc. I have received a national golden medal as well, in a competition.

Negative:

This was a pretty small university, it just entered a university state during my studies. And the other students were simply partying all time, and I focused on my studies double time, because I didn't do really anything else than learning and project works. So is it really considered as a big success?

**Career:**

Positive:

I have achieved a lot of my childhood dreams. I could do jobs, which I never thought I would really do. I know very few can even enter these kind of jobs remotely, and I could do remote works for places and companies I would never think I will. And I don't think I would starve at any time.

Negative:

During my whole 8 years of career, I was fired 3 times for low performance. It was shocking, I never saw these before, and I thought I did everything I could. I loved 2 jobs out of these 3. This is my biggest pain, because I felt some kind of success in my studies, and I thought my efforts will pay off. These happened while firing 1 other person as well in both places out of the 3. But still, I received that negative feedback in both places. Although I'm I really don't want to switch careers or learn something entirely different. And I feel its not arguable at all. I already thought about that, but I just can't switch. I know people who were never fired in their career. Why to be happy for a hardly-reachable job for many, if I lose that in a relatively short time?

**Relationships:**

Positive:

I had a happy 2 year long relationship without any arguments. I also had some shorter ones. All happened with some women I considered like top models, I loved them.

Negative:

The 2 year long could exist only because of the COVID. There wasn't any dating during that time, and when it finished, she just left me. And there's a woman, who literally hates me. I didn't know for a long time, how to react to some situations, and I tried to joke with sensitive topics, etc. I'm already over 30, and I had never have any wife or kids. I know people who could be in a relationship in their entire life. Then why to be happy about this?

So is it a success or a failure? Objectively, where can I be in my life? Am I progressing well? Am I behind most of the people? Is there anything, which is critically bad, and should be fixed ASAP, because later there will be some big issues I don't see now?",mentalhealth,RandomDoctor2,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1detzc4/how_to_process_my_failures_if_these_are_really/,0,2.0,0.0,4.2665847482395e-06
I miss high school so much that it’s making me depressed. ,1,1.0,2024-06-13 12:03:18,"Throwaway bc I’m embarrassed.

I’ve been out of high school for over a full year now. Coming up in august it’ll be 2 years since i started my senior year.

For most of my school experience, I was in a small private school, up until my 8th grade year, when we switched to home schooling. We only did that for one year, as it wasn’t really for us. 

The year that followed, my freshman year, I was sent to public school. I didn’t really feel like i fit in there, and wasn’t sure what to do. Then, Covid happened. We were all stuck at home, which wasn’t too hard for me to handle. I spent my Sophomore year at home as well. 

My Junior year was different. I decided to enroll in a career-based school that puts you in classes depending on the job you wanted to do later in life. I decided to go into the graphic design path. There, I finally found my people. Everyone was friends, everyone was so nice. I have never felt so included and comfortable in my entire life. I met some amazing people, and made some amazing friends. That year is the absolute highlight for me. I even met a wonderful girl.

That girl and I started dating towards the end of the year, and that summer was spent hanging out with her and friends nearly daily. It was so perfect. I miss it so much. 

Later on that summer, things sort of fell apart a little. The girl and I broke up. That destroyed me. One of my best friends moved to Florida. That destroyed me too. I have never really fully recovered from that breakup I don’t think. I still think about her all the time, even though it’s been nearly 2 years. 

Senior year wasn’t as fun. I spent most of my time longing for her, hoping for a second chance. It almost happened too.. but it fell right through my fingers. 

Now, I’m almost 20, and I absolutely do not know how to get over this. I’m miserable.

I was molested by a family member,1,1.0,2024-06-13 11:49:54,"Even before I started writing here today, I thought to myself, ""I must be a cornball type of guy"" just because I wanted to anonymously get something off my chest. There's a pattern like this, with all my thoughts, that I have been seeing a lot lately. 

  
I honestly don't know where to start with this post so I'm just gonna start at my earliest memories.

When I was around 5 years old, I stayed with an immediate family member. A whole lot of my family was there,  I could never name off everyone. This made things especially challenging after all these years, because instead of having 1 person I can cast blame on, I only have ambiguity. There were many, and multiple people, who hurt me as well as others.

I have this early memory of being with my Older brother, well call him BOOF. Boof and I were always so energetic and happy when we were young, jumping into pools n shit. One day, we were next to some shed on the same property where I remember my cousin performing sexual acts on both of us, while being guided by an adult. To this day, neither me nor boof can remember who this adult is. I suppose it is for the best, because getting away with murder doesn't sound ideal. Well, me and boof endured this and have talked only once in our lives about it. 

I reluctantly brought it up one time, about 5 or so years ago, and he just told me he swore it was a dream. He said theres no way it could've happened. After explaining I endured the same thing as well as saw him there, in the fucked up position, we both agreed to NOT talk about it ever again with anybody. 

Well today, I'm coming out. I did already tell my spouse. He is very supportive about it as well. Boof will not discuss it for a while I'm afraid, unless he told his gf behind closed doors. We are very similar in this way, so its very likely.

As grotesque as the memories are, theres a lot of weird twists and turns that come up when I reflect. Sure, I could get mad at my cousin, but it would be pointless. She was around the same age as me and was just following what fucked up instructions she had received from some fucked up relative. There was a court case that I recently learned about that involved my favorite uncle, but he was proven innocent somehow. All I have is pain, exhaustion, and questions which will never be answered.

Sorry if I'm rambling, its just that I heard if I share my story, the pain might start decreasing more.

"I Do Everything For My Mental Health, But Still Depressed - Why?",1,0.67,2024-06-13 10:33:13,"Hi all,

For a good number of years now, I have struggled with continuous, albeit moderate, depression. Ever since a break up when I was 18 where I messed things up, that was the first time in my life when I felt properly depressed, and ever since then things just haven't quite been right, despite being completely over the situation and the girl in question (I'm 29 now).

My depression is not the kind that keeps me up all night crying or stops me from eating, but just a constant low mood that stops me from enjoying life or being excited at anything. I have ADHD as well, which doesn't help matters when it comes to motivation.

That being said, I do absolutely everything to help my mental health:

* I practise yoga
* eat healthily (vegetarian for 4 years, but supplement with B12, Iron, D, Omega 3, etc)
* avoid ultra processed foods (80-90% of my diet is natural foods)
* Take a probiotic daily
* run 50km a week
* gym 3 times a week
* avoid pornography
* healthy sex life
* Walks with my dog twice a day
* Reducing caffeine consumption to minimal amounts
* Counselling (this didn't help, however, because I had no trauma or 'bad thoughts' to discuss. I'm just low)
* Socialise with friends at my running club
* Journaling positivity and achievements of the day
* TDCS Headset Use - Day 6 so far

Doing all of the above and feeling hopeless about the future and my mental health is mind boggling to me, and it's really starting to get to me. God knows how I'd feel if I didn't do any of the above.

I'm not requesting medical advice necessarily, but any thoughts on my situation would be much appreciated, even just some guidance on anything I haven't thought of or looked at.

People on the internet need to understand this one thing,3,0.8,2024-06-13 04:31:02,"You can hop on reddit, get on a burner account, and wreak absolute havoc with zero repercussions. 

You can respond to someone’s post about how they want to off themself and decide to tell them they’re a horrible human being for putting other people through that. 

You can judge someone for using Reddit or the internet as a source of help. 

You can make the conscious decision to bully someone who is at rock bottom. 

It’s so incredibly easy being mean to people you don’t know. You’ll never learn their name, you’ll never see them in person. You’ll never feel the guilt or see their face when they read your disgusting message. 

Like I said, there’s zero repercussions. 

I’ll still never be able to understand why people do it. Why trolls are a thing. Why people find gratification in doing these things. 

We learn to ignore the “internet trolls,” or we hear “don’t let them get to you,” as a response. But we continue to allow it to happen. It’s almost expected of you to just brush off rude comments and you’re weak if you let them get to you. Why is that? How come they don’t put algorithms in play to stop trolling from happening? Bullying on the internet has caused a lot of issues. 

It’s one of the most disgusting things on the planet in my opinion. 

Personally, I’ve reached out for help. Several times. Been at rock bottom, several times. Wanted to off myself, several. times. And every time, I’d get rude comments that just made me want to do it even more. 

One rude comment almost trumps 5 nice ones. And they know that. 

I understand the whole “hurt people hurt people” scenario but damn. I’ll admit it, it gets to me. I get that I’m putting a target on my back by admitting that but nothing will change if I don’t post this. Either way, I’m going to receive hate.

It's gotten to the point where daily life is not intuitive for me anymore. It takes so much effort to get out of bed, to eat, shower, talk, think... It's exhausting to exist. I still haven't finished my breakfast yet.

But I'm trying. 

I have a psychiatrist and a therapist I like. I've started SSRIs

I'm reaching out to friends and family for help.

Dealing with Anxiety,1,1.0,2024-06-13 09:13:16,"Hi everyone,  
Lately, I've been feeling really anxious and confused about my sexual identity. I want to make it clear that I am absolutely sure I am straight. I've never felt attracted to men emotionally or sexually, and I can't imagine holding hands with or kissing another man.  
But even with this certainty, my mind keeps telling me that people around me might think I'm gay, especially since I'm naturally shy, quiet, and very soft-spoken guy. This anxiety makes me feel very awkward in social situations. Sometimes, I also notice people looking at me strangely, and it happens quite frequently, as if they're thinking, ""What's wrong with this guy?""  


I can't afford therapy right now, so I'm hoping to get some advice and support here.  
I would really appreciate any tips on how to handle this anxiety and how to deal with situations where this worry comes up. Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you manage it? Any resources or reading suggestions would also be really helpful.

Though my first therapist didn’t last long and my current has only just started helping me. 
What do I need to do? 
I’m currently taking 10 milligrams of buspirone twice a day and 150 mg of Bupropion Hcl xl/Wellbutrin xl. 

I also tried Prozac for a while but I was taken off it. I was bad about not taking my medicine so I may not have allowed myself time to actually try it. Should I ask to try it again?

I can’t explain the feeling. It’s not just bad it’s overwhelming. It’s also bad when someone laughs at me or (extremely bad) if someone is annoyed at me or looks at me in an arrogant way.  Like I’m worth less than them. 

This can’t just be low self esteem.

Sudden loss of Spirituality? Do i need to worry? ,1,1.0,2024-06-13 07:38:22,"Hi, so for context, i have been very spiritual for the past 5 or 6 years. It was a very important part of my everyday life.

The spells i did oftentimes came true with very high accuracy. 
In the last 2-3 years that became even more extreme. I started sensing things and felt that i had supernatural powers. I ""sensed"" supernatural beings around me, i had a tree send me messages through my mind and lead me to a place through a pendulum that it had previously shown to me through my mind. I was sure there were two spirits watching over me that protected me. I believed that God's were watching over me and sending me signs.

I feel like a person with good mental health who’s pretending to be a in a worse state then I am.,1,0.67,2024-06-13 05:55:20,"Hey I’m a 15 yr old male who is trying to make sense of the way I’m feeling. I have never really used Reddit but I can’t find anything online to really explain the way I’m feeling and I guess I’m seeking someone who can relate or explain? To be honest I kinda feel like a good person who’s pretending to be worse than I am. For example I convinced my mom to allow me to see a therapist but I find myself feeling like I’m lying to my therapist for no reason. When I originally wanted to go to a therapist, it was because I was cutting myself. Thinking about this I start to wonder if I was just doing it for attention or I just wanted people to see that I was cutting myself. I feel like I’m pretending that I have stronger feelings than I do. The only way I can think of explaining this is kind of a numbness, but I tell people I’m feeling a way that I should be in that scenario. Like when my father went to rehab, I didn’t really care, weirdly enough. But when people asked me, I kind of broke down and cried about it but when I think about it, I don’t know why I did that when I honestly didn’t care I feel like I pretended like that was some thing that affected me very heavily. I guess to say that I have good mental health would be an overstatement in a way because I kind of just feel numb about most things. This kind of feels more like a rant because I can’t really fully explain what I’m feeling. Can anybody relate to this?

My parents are attentive towards my younger sister’s mental health but they ignore mine,1,1.0,2024-06-13 05:48:31,"Very sorry for any grammar mistakes. Unfortunately, English isn’t my native language.

My (F18) parents are always so attentive and helpful towards my younger sister and her mental health. Not too long ago, they told me that she had admitted to having a girlfriend. My parents are very religious people which led to them taking this issue very seriously. I won't go into detail regarding the whole ordeal but it was bad. My-sister-tried-to-run-away-from-home bad. My parents decided to bring her to a therapist due to this and other issues. From then on, my sister has been seeing a therapist very frequently. I don't like to boast but I do deem myself as a supportive person and I have been nothing but very helpful regarding the situation wuth my sister.

However, I've been facing a lot of issues for a long time and all l ever wanted was to seek proper help that isn't from a school counsellor who reduces my feelings to typical ""high school girl"" feelings. I just finished my final exam and graduated school which means that appointments won't bother my studying schedule. I wish I could put into words about my issues but l've always found it difficult. What's odd is that my parents acknowledge my severe anxiety and they never fail point it out - along with multiple other problems I face. They mentioned bringing me as they suspect I'm autistic but nothing has been done yet they constantly make jokes on my suspected autism which led me to believe they were simply joking all this while. I'm genuinely clueless and I physically can't bring myself to be vulnerable about this to them or ask them to take me to a psychiatrist. I don't know what to do.

I might've missed out on some things as I wrote on a whim while feeling distressed. Please give me a bit of guidance. I'd really appreciate it.

My work is ok but not in the direction I expect for my career worth.
I’m trying to grow into other areas but feel a little insecure about it (still, pushing thru).
I have a LDR with the person I love and loves my back but damn long distance is so hard sometimes.

Jobs are not great. Nothing better than where I currently am.
I struggle to get things done (excersise, hobbies, journaling, outings with friends)
I’ve lost my initiative to connect with ppl at work cause I just want out and they’re all perky and happy (newbies)
I like my country but damn: traffic, pollution, cost of living, insecurity, makes it hard.

I do therapy which helps but I still struggle to see the bright side of it. And when I do, it gets taken by wanting to continuing growing -Aspiring kinda sucks sometimes but you have to keep on going or else you get stuck.

It’s frustrating. I feel like I’m getting mild depression again, fighting my mind to avoid going into the “I just don’t want to wake up tmrrw” or “I wish it would just stop”. I know it comes from feeling overwhelmed. From wishing I hadn’t have all this happening.

I guess besides venting, my question is: what helps you when things around seem so overwhelming?

So, I'm in my early 20s and lately I've really been hit by some bitter emotions regarding my life experience and where I'm currently at. Actually I would be classified as an ""on time"" or ""regular"" young adult. Right about to finish my uni studies, learned to live on my own and stuff like that. 
Still, I feel like I missed on many things both in my teenage years and in my early adulthood. When I was younger it was due to the fact that I was lacking mental care and I couldn't do many things. Now that I'm almost fully recovered thanks to a few years with professional help, I find myself in a healthier mental state, and I truly know how to face situations with a balanced attitude. But the thing is, I feel like healing took a big part of my life away, and now I'm not where I would have thought my promising life would have been. 

I started to obsess over the fact that I'm average on many things, while I'm surrounded by some cases who are making exceptional things. I never made a penny while others are having great ideas on business and succeeding in that (recently started to learn some business related skills with 0 results, and I am very discouraged. Without any money I feel like I cannot do many experiences), never gained a circle of friends (During these years I was very focused on my studies and goals, while others seemed to be on a party-mode all the time, so either was difficult to relate or it was difficult for me to find people that were lovely and interesting to be with on a deeper level. Loneliness is another big feeling rn), and overall I experienced a constant sense of trying not to stay behind other folks (and that sucked all my energy) rather than feeling like having a good starting point to learn, grow, and discover things and relationships that will make me happy and richer inside. 

I don't know how to overcome this sense of feeling lost and not having done anything special with my life. To me regular stuff is like an usual procedure that needs to be done.

Hopefully I explained myself, since this is not my mother tongue. Willing to listen from your perspective!

I messed up. ,2,1.0,2024-06-13 00:08:31,"So, quick rundown first. The last month has been extremely rough on me.(21 M)

I lost my job, got dumped, and blew the transmission in my faithful old truck, all in the same day. I couldn't get any help with my truck, couldn't afford a shop, so I called my deadbeat father that I have spoken to 4 times in the last 15 years. He showed up, helped me drop my transmission, found out it would cost too much to rebuild, and he just up and left. Haven't heard from him since.

Now to the me part. Last Thursday, I did a bit of binge drinking, thinking it would help me out with my depression. Needless to say, it did not. I ended up sobbing in my truck with a [redacted] to my head. My best friend in the whole world managed to make me see sense, and brought me back. I've really come to depend on her. We talk all day every day. She is the best person I know. 

Then, on Saturday evening, I got a major nosebleed that lasted 3 hours straight and ended with me in the ER because I lost 2 pints of blood. Obviously that made me extremely woozy. The blood loss, coupled with the anxiety and depression, and a bit more alcohol because I didn't learn my lesson, lead me to a full mental breakdown Monday evening. And of course, I panicked and directed all my pent up emotions at my best friend. She hadn't been responding at all that day, and my abandonment issues due to aforementioned father lead me in a downward spiral of overthinking where I thought I was losing her too. So I lashed out. And it was bad. 

I haven't heard from her since. And that really hurts. Because the two of us have similar mental issues, and we've become kinda codependent. So losing her has just torn a part of me out. I hope I can recover. I hope I didn't drive a wedge between us permanently.

And of course, I have made my first appointment with a therapist. 

I'm sorry about the vent post, but other than her, I have nobody to talk to about this, and I guess I came here to see if anybody had some advice for me about any of this. Feel free to ask questions.

My life seems to be a series of shorts intense highs and lows without any middle ground. The only things that make me happy are bad for me, or at least have potential to be detrimental in some way or another and the prospect of a normal life doesn’t sound like enough to keep me going. I need these constant intense sequences to feel okay, but they’re very draining and i don’t know what to do. Whether it be romantic relationships, friendships, work, hobbies or anything else, i get consumed by one issue and everything else loses all meaning. I don’t plan for the future, can’t almost - i sacrifice it for the sake of short term entertainment all the while knowing what i’m doing is bad for me.

Test day panic attack,2,1.0,2024-06-12 23:39:20,"Hi all, I’m (42M) ADHD and have started an extensive professional certification in wine this year (WSET4). I never finished college because of undiagnosed ADHD and lack of motivation. I’m now 14 years into a successful career in the wine industry and have decided to push myself by going for this certification. I’ve never know how to study and have only recently started figuring out what works for me. 

Today was my 2nd of 5 exams for this certification and I absolutely fucking melted down this morning before the exam. For the last 10ish days, I’ve found that studying has been even more difficult for me. I read a passage in the book and review flash cards but no matter how many times I review I could not get a lot of things to stick. My brain just seemed to be blocking me from inputting new information. I’d reread the passage again, then close my eyes and ask myself the question. Every single time, I could remember 3/4 things and I could visualize the text but the part I couldn’t remember was just blank in my mind. After rereading the same passage 3 times this morning and realizing it wasn’t sticking with 2.5 hours to go before the exam, I just went into a full on panic attack. Thankfully my wife was home and she just remained calm and listened to me cry and talk and after a 30 minute walk I calmed down enough to go take my exam. There is nothing really on the line here other than time and money to retake the exam and I told myself that repeatedly but it’s like my brain just wants me to succeed so badly that I can’t handle the thought of not passing. 

Test went ok and I feel much better on the other side although my anxiety is still very heightened.

now that i finally got to switch to paroxetin last fall, i’m finally seeing a change! it’s not huge, but it’s been the first medicine to actually make me less depressed. the past ones at most helped reduce si and self harm. i now am able to feel happy and neutral some days. it hasn’t touched my ocd or anxiety whatsoever, but at least it’s something. 

the problem: i’ve started gaining a lot of weight. i was always slightly overweight but that’s because i hate exercise and have eating disorder issues like binging. however in the last half year my weight is just adding up, despite no other life change. i’m only 24 so i doubt it’s an effect of aging. i only now realized it’s likely paroxetin causing this. i’ve gained over 20kg in a short time, and it doesn’t seem to be stopping.

My anxiety drives me insane,5,1.0,2024-06-12 19:32:28,"Hello reddit people. As soon as I could think I knew something is off. To put it briefly, I might have an anxiety disorder due my childhood. I‘m very much aware of where it comes from, so I don‘t need any thoughts on that. So now, after I wanted to change my course of study and therefore had to look for a new university, it got worse and worse. I‘m living alone and I have some friends I barely meet, because they are very busy just like me before. I really want to finally step into the career I always wanted, but something holds me back. I see some good opportunities, but I‘m too insecure to apply. It sounds ridiculous even for me. But it‘s not everything. For example, I see people going out talking to strangers and that leads to cool experiences. Whenever I try that I have the will, but something is holding me back. I don‘t even overthink possible and exaggerated outcomes, even when I think positive, it‘s like a force in my chest saying ”maybe not today“. I hate it. I‘m fully aware, that this is just trauma response for keeping me safe, but being aware doesn‘t help at all. Yes, I‘m already seeking out for professional help. That leads to three problems: 1. In my environment, there are hardly any therapists I can effort. Also most waiting times for them are like two years or more. 2. Why do you have to call to request an appointment because of your anxiety? Whenever I talk to someone on the phone, embarrassing moments happen to me. 3. I had a bad experience with a therapist once. I was new and he didn't even looked at me the whole conversation and asked why I was there. How can you simply answer that? I had an anxiety attack which leads to him asking me out of practice. It signaled to me that me and my problems are not wanted. 
I'm sick. I just want this ”holding back force“ to finally disappear. I don‘t expect help from people in my environment, the topic about mental illnesses are hushed up. Stepping out of my comfort zone hardly helps me personally. I noticed that during presentations at school. It never got better, not until the end.

Dark phase is over but mentally exhausted - part 3,1,1.0,2024-06-13 02:45:30,"My biological mother still alive bt my biological father passed away.I for so long, grew up with anger and resentment on my biological father due to his lifestyle and comments given by adopted family and extended family and even during my wedding, we had an arguement and none from my biological family attended my wedding.But few weeks before passing away, my biological father asked about me and my wife with my biological mother, but since im wasn't talking much with my biological mother, i couldn't get this information. I attended his funeral and did the last rights. Ever since,i been visiting and talking to my biological mother but not frequently. I have a younger sister and younger brother from my biological parents, but we are not in good terms.The relationship soured when during their younger days, i found out that instead studying, my sister was going out with a guyi scolded her for this and promised to get her married and told her not to take any wrong decisions and instead to concentrate on her studies. she got pregnant and eloped with the guy, and came back and the guy ditched her and married another lady. She delivered the baby and my biological parents raised her kid. Now she is remarried. My younger brother dropped off school and the relationship with me soured when i scolded him for his drinking behaviours and for dropping off school. and now he is working for meager wages and heard that he is financially struggling. 
My biological mother asked me to support her financially as my brother and sister are struggling financially and later i found out that they are pressuring my mother to get money from me in pretense of expenses for my mother. I give her some cash whenever i visit as i felt too tired with all that going on.

In all this turbulence, one person who stayed true and strong with me, took me up when im down and broken was my wife.
They say that god doesn't give you what you like but what you need the most in your life. He gave her to me and i treasure her. I at times feel bad for being very emotional and treating her badly in the past during the dark phases of our life.

Her parents stopped talking to her when she started financing her studies independently and didn't even attended our wedding.Its been 7 years they left her like that.

Help with a Son,1,1.0,2024-06-13 02:29:58,"Trying to make a long story short…

Son, 24, mental break about 4 weeks ago. Involuntary commitment for past 10 days. Coming home tomorrow. Refuses professional help. So I’m all he got. Help. How do I set him set himself right? Get him thinking clearly? Give him something to live for?

I have many ideas about the root issues.

But I think I need to get him to see one OR figure out how to live with all the issues.

He’s angry. He’s parinoid. He doesn’t know what his purpose is. He desperately wants to be something. 

But I think he wants to figure it out but he don’t know how, or wont try.

My question: are there activities that I can give him to figure it out on his own?

Gonna start with asking him to plan his next day in 2hr blocks. Up at 8, bed by 10, sleep by 12.

Giving him small things to do, like cook 2 meals a day. Walk the dogs for an hour, plant a garden.

I think making him journal is key. But he fears some reading it. Gonna make him write a page and burn it the next night. *shrug* Don’t know if that’ll work.

We could make this about me but I’d rather not…but we can…just be polite.

More details that you could skip:



6 out of 10 on the ADHD scale.

Gamer since 6yrs old. Was his escape place.

High internet consumption from 10 to 19. More hours on the net than sleep. All the things you see about online kids. He did it.

Highly intelligent.

Father had no clue.

Involuntary admission for Psyc issues. (Ummm, the health care system sucks…but they did the best they could, but yeah, I would only advise that route out of desperation)

In turn, my craving to relapse has grown more and more to the point where it’s near impossible to ignore. Every time I think about my ex, my brain goes to “if you had valium right now, you wouldn’t be suffering this much” and things of that sort.

Why is work so stressful?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 23:52:35,"I am fine up until I sit at my cubicle. It feels like there is a heaviness surrounding it. I’m not getting sales but people do talk to me. Idk if I need to call a priest to bless my seat but every time I take lunch or leave for the day, I cry out my frustrations. There is a mix of other things that make me cry outside of work. 

I’ll feel better after crying but the minute I sit down, I get brain fog and fatigue. I don’t know if the seat has a bad vibe because of the last girl who sat there (she had anger issues). I just feel dead. I’m gonna move seats tomorrow to see if that changes things. 

I’m also starting trauma therapy EMDR so I feel so sad thinking of a lot of my issues. 

I get flustered at jobs that I can’t grasp right away. It could be food service or sales, if I’m not doing great at my job it really takes a damper on me. 

But what do I do to cope with my stressful job until I get a new position or turn my sales around?

Jet lag from hell and anxiety doesn't help. Please help.,1,1.0,2024-06-12 23:10:39,"I flew 22 hours from Chicago to Chiang mai Thailand and got maybe 3-4 hours of sleep before the flight. I haven't been on a long haul before and my anxiety was through the roof before the flight and during the flight so I couldn't sleep one bit. Finally getting to Chiang mai at 10ish pm and checking into the hotel I took a melatonin/chamomile supplement I got from 7/11 and slept for maybe an hour and woke up heart racing and mind racing. Couldn't sleep at all after that but got out of bed at 9ish to eat breakfast and walk around town. 

I think I messed up trying to take a nap around 4ish and got maybe an hour of extra sleep. Walked around some more and tried going to bed around 11pm but was up all night once again. At this point I was exhausted but mind racing and I started somewhat hallucinating and felt like I was in speed or something. 

Went to the clinic at 6ish am and they said I had severe anxiety and it led to insomnia and gave me 5 mg diazepam to take every night before bed and laxatives because the anxiety led to no bowel movements for almost 3 days.

I took the diazepam at around 930 because ei couldn't stand being awake any longer and slept until about 2ish and then hit the town again until 10 when I got back showered and took another pill only to sleep until 3 am and my heart is racing again and cannot fall asleep.

Where I am,1,1.0,2024-06-12 23:06:03,"Sometimes I have to take a step back and just appreciate where I am mentally. 

In early 2020, I left my now ex wife because I was totally miserable. I didn't go about it in the best way but with the benefit of hindsight, had I communicated more, it would have just prolonged the inevitable and we wouldn't have worked out. 

I became homeless and was taken in by a couple of friends. I ended up living with them for six months until I moved back in with my mum & dad. That was late 2020. 

In early 2021, the loneliness hit me and I became suicidal. I was living in a seaside town. There was one evening that was particularly stormy so I walked out to the sea front and stood there, seriously considering walking into the water. I ultimately decided not to go through with it because of the shadow it would cast over my nieces and nephew. 

Anyway, cut to 4 years later and I've met a woman I adore, who I'm engaged to. I've moved to Scotland to be with her, leaving my old life behind. I quit my job and found another up here. I can honestly say I've never been happier. 

I still think back to how I felt in those darkest moments. How hopeless it all was. And I can barely reconcile that feeling with the happiness and fulfilment I feel now. My point is that no matter how bleak it may feel, there can be light at the end of the tunnel.

Embarrassing Depressive Tendencies,1,1.0,2024-06-12 23:00:33,"In the past especially when I was a young depressed teenager I took to writing poetry as a way to try and work out my feelings in detail.
 Recently my depression and suicidal ideation have gotten particularly bad and I, from nowhere, just opened up notes on my phone and all this shit just came pouring out of me. I’ve only typed in it twice and those times were a month apart and those are to two paragraphs. Below is the poetry I don’t know what to do with it but I think I’d like it to be out there in the universe after I’m gone 

I will die on this room
And I’m trying everything from doctors to shrooms from work to rest but somehow I’m  just as depressed and my body is failing and my minds been gone for so long I only recall how to sing songs. And now I’m forgetting faces, I’m forgetting times spent, times had, voices and the fun we’ve had in these places. I’m living in Deja vu, everything is “I’ve heard that, I’ve felt this” and now I’m afraid I’ll forget you. 
I will die in this room, an embarresment a disgrace it’s all gone wrong and im just somebody not built for this place and there are tears on this face that I don’t recognise anymore, where’s the smile wheres the eyes where’s the voice my mother adores?
I will die in this room and I’m so glad the walls are painted, the sky has turned grey I’m infectiously tainted and it’s cold, it’s so damn cold as I watch myself grow old. 
I will die in the room and I can’t sleep sober intoxicated inebriated whatever feels like “this aint over” but there’s so much hate, calm down too late I’ve missed my chance. Watch it walk, don’t talk and speak when your spoken to. Don’t think don’t feel just do and don’t give up, give in. Be consumed by the life you think you’re in. 
I’m confused, I’m confused by misery by anger by love by fury am I motivated? eyes dilated? I feel ready for war and I have to be this be. 
This war never ends and I will die in this room 

I will die in this room and it’s getting a little closer, time to say goodbye raise a glass and toast her. Here’s to the ending of tide, still, peaceful water and whatever’s left inside so let me rest. It’s been a while, without the nightmares, this fear and sense I don’t belong here. Come see this life and steal it, I’m not sure if it’s just in my head anymore and I Swear I can feel it. On the tips of my fingers in shake across my brow or silence in my ears telling me to die now. Baby let me die, how can I go on like this. Too afraid to live and afraid to be free, afraid that I might take a couple people with me. God, just let me go first. I swear it’s for the best and it’s cold in the chest already. 
I will die in this room and I’m sorry I feel this way, but you’re all the reason I’m here day to day, maybe I’ll be gone today or maybe another day. Pushing pushing it back just a little further so I can see their smiles for just a little longer and I hope that I will remember. What it’s like to know you are loved, or to feel love, or give love or even just to believe in it anymore. I’m surrounded and left out. I don’t know the rules or how this works but I’ll figure it out until I can’t. 
There’s just no space for me and I know this was t the plan but we make the best of what we’ve got and at least we gave it a shot. God loves a trier, so he birthed me in fire and hateful desire.

Imagination as a life raft,1,1.0,2024-06-12 22:29:41,"This is super long, and is not super important.



I'm not sure if this is the right place for it so feel free to delete it if not. But after a conversation with a friend, I thought I'd share what keeps me alive in my darkest moments. 

A bit of background; I struggle with bipolar disorder, ADHD and PTSD. I have numerous years of intense trauma and I suffer with the symptoms of PTSD everyday as a result. I'm also currently going through a depressive episode that kind of took me by surprise so it's been heavy days for sure. But there have been many heavy and dark days, and for some reason I've decided to stick around even when I have struggled to articulate why. I think I'm finally able to. I hope this helps or is at least semi-interesting.

I got into the whole manifestation train a few years back, and although I don't believe in it now I did gain one valuable skill from it; imagination. I mean the kind of extremely detailed intentional imagination, not an abstract fantacy. I use it to imagine, in detail (sounds, smells, sensations on my skin, buildings, weather etc.) what my life would look like if I didn't suffer so acutely with bipolar and ptsd. Who would I be? What would I sound like? What would my interests be? What kind of friends would I have? What would my apartment look like? What would my curtains look like? I mean in extreme detail, I have to be able to recall it as if it was a place I'd actually been. Sometimes I'll write it down or take a voice note if my brain is struggling to hold on to details, but usually the image and the emotions it conjures up is enough. 

I'm not a mental health professional so I can't explain exactly how this, frankly made up, image creates a sense of longing, but it does. This longing will usually stay with me for a while. Sometimes it'll make me sad (because it's not my reality) and sometimes it will make me angry (that I even have to imagine such a seemingly mundane existence). And in those feelings I'm able to process the pain I'm currently experiencing. It allows the feelings to come to the surface, and I can cry, I can write, I can stare at a wall and contemplate, it's different every time. But after a few days, the image will be almost like a memory (I'll obviously know I imagined this some days ago, and somehow (again, I'm not an expert), the image will become a kind of memory making it feel like something different than an imagination. Not quite a real memory, not quite a figment of my imagination. The feelings I feel when I think about it is real. The effort I took to conjure up the image is real, so the image becomes its own kind of not-real but still real thing. This feeling of attachment to the image will usually be enough to spark even a mustard seed of hope.

Not enough to suddenly be cured of depression, and not even enough to stop my unhealthy coping skills. But enough to want to believe that it \*can\* be real. Often times that desire for it to be real, will be enough to take tiny steps. A shower, a dish wash up, a reply to a friend or even searching up mental health professionals on TikTok to know I'm not loosing it. 

This was super long, and I'm sorry if it was useless. Thank you for reading, and excuse my spelling mistakes. Just thought I'd share in case it could be interesting/useful to someone.

"Tw:rape,abuse",1,1.0,2024-06-12 22:19:48,"16F currently.When i was 5th grade my parents split and it really took a toll on my dad. He used to keep me and my brother(now 12M) in the car for hours at a time do he could drive and vent to us about how much he hated my mom and how much he hated me specifically for not doing anything to help him.at first when it happened i was confused and sad but now i just tune out when he does it because hes just angry and i know he doesnt actually hate me,it just sounds like a broken record now.

He always denies being violent but they always were violent ,but one of the things he would blame me about and yell at me over is one time that they were fighting and it got really bad and he chokeslamed her into the wall and broke it,i was like 8-9 and when he left to his room i went to my mom and said she needed to leave him and he told me he overheard this and its always made him tense with me and untrusting to me. 

 there is one thing he told me and my brother that just recently has been making me so anxious and guilty. I didnt have an idea of what rape was when he told me this but now that i do its been eating at me. He told us once that he had to “force my mother to have us” and that she never wanted us in the first place. At first it disressed me and my brother started to cry when it happened but i got over it and forgot for a bit because my mother always loved us.But im home alone at his house right now and its driving me mad. My parents already have an 11 year age gap and my mom was 19 when she married,am i a product of rape??

 I feel disgusting thinking of this and so guilty i havent been able to even look at my self for a month now and i avoid wearing my glasses or contacts i cant describe how it feels.i feel so disgusted with myself because i think it means i wasnt even born normaly and lovingly i was born from him being violent.I used to just tell myself that maybe he meant she wasnt allowed to abort but my mom is quite religous and doesnt belive jn abortions in the first place. My mom used to tell us she was in college for political science and i love hearing her stories of her before us but now it makes me feel disgusting because the only reason she gsve it all up was because i was born and i literally took everything from her. And i feel extra guilty because i still miss my dad and i love him even though i find him disgusting and i dont like it when he touches me, im old enough to not visit but i still do voluntarily.

What did he mean by that? Am i wrong to still love him?

"How to free yourself from loneliness, low self esteem, and build a community",2,1.0,2024-06-12 18:17:48,"I’m a 27M who still lives with their parents in Maryland. For about the time I was in mid high school to now I’ve felt incredibly lonely. Over the years I’ve gone from friend group to friend group attempting to find tribe I can call my own.

On paper everything seems fine. But I’m not happy. 

All my life I’ve struggled with self esteem and confidence, but I never let it get to me until I was around 15-16. I isolated myself from the world in order to protect myself from all the negativity of shallow classmates and bad academic performance. In doing so I may have stunted my social and mental growth. I developed a stutter and even lower self confidence.

I found a church home recently and I like it and the people there, but I still have trouble connecting and truly bonding with folks there. To be honest I have trouble connecting to almost everyone I meet. It’s a wonder how I have the friend I have now.

I don’t really talk to anyone from high school or college anymore. I was sort of that weird socially awkward quiet kid in the back of the class. I wish I want though. I wish I was different. If I could go back in time I would change everything.

I used to be funny. I would make witty sarcastic remarks that people enjoyed hearing. Now I can barely muster up a sentence with stuttering. I want my confidence back. I want to be a person again.

I have these horrible intrusive thoughts constantly. Literally every second of every day I'm trying to get rid of these intrusive thoughts by thinking positively but it only works like half of the time. These bastards that I hate won't get out of my head. I am sometimes in physical pain from punching and slapping myself because of these thoughts. I can't do anything. When I'm trying to do something I have to be thinking of positive people/words and if something negative comes into my head, I have to stop or start over. The word DEAD keeps coming into my head and other related words that involve injury or illness. I regret everything I do. Genuinely. Everything. I'm also incredibly indecisive, because I am so desperate not to end up regretting what I do. Which is normally what ends up happening. I keep thinking inanimate objects have feelings aswell. All these problems and these regrets I have in my life have been making me feel absolutely dreadful. I'm purposely isolating myself everyday and all I want to do is sit around playing video games all day on my own because I'm literally unable to do anything else. I've been feeling like ending my life lately.  I went to a doctor recently and the doctor said I have OCD. I feel like the things I said about the intrusive thoughts is what brought the idea of ocd up, but I'm not sure if the ocd is also responsible for the regrets, indecisiveness and worry.

I have a pretty normal life but everyday relatives constantly shame my looks, grades, and attitude which really hurts me. People in school describe me as cute, kind-hearted, and smart but I don't think so anymore. I haven't been eating at the right time and instead, I've been eating huge meals every night when everyone is sleeping to prevent from gaining weight. Every school night I would study from 6 pm to 3 am to get my grades up for the expectations of my school but never made it in the list of honors. My elders would tell me to grow up and practice for the adult world but they wouldn't let me out by myself nor help me. My cousins would make fun of my attitude because I always acted childish.

What is it and is it serious?,2,1.0,2024-06-12 17:44:26,"Recentely some of my weird behaviours and thoughts have been getting worse and I don't know if they are normal thus I'm overreacting or there is smt wrong with me and I should seek help.

1)When someone asks me to borrow something, especially my sister. Usually I either don't want to give away this thing bc ""it's mine"" or ""it belongs there and if you take it I'll have to worry all day about putting it back"", and if they don't give the thing back once they are done I get REALLY mad and sometimes even cry

2)I don't like unpacking my stuff from my suitcase bc then I will have to put it back on at the end of summer and if I leave there it's already ready and I don't have to fear I might lose something

3)Caring about how my things are positioned in my room and I HATE when somebody touches smt and I have to put it back in its place, mainly bc it has to be how I like it in my order and bc I'm scared I'll lose these things and maybe somebody (my sister) might take them and I won't realize.

4)When somebody wants to borrow something I might just gift it to them. Once my sister asked me if she could try my swimsuit on, and she ended up liking it so much she asked if she could borrow it and I just said she could have it. Then I went to the bathroom and cried for like a whole 20 mins and even started to cut through my skin with my nails almost to the point it bled. the only reasons I could find are that ""she deserves it more than me"", ""I wouldn't wear it either way bc it's too pretty for me and she's gorgeous so she'll definitely use it more"" and also that ""if I share it then at this point why have it"", I bought for me cause I never dress nicely bc I feel like who I am is just someone who doesn't care and maybe by buying and wearing this swimsuit I could escape this ""false/forced"" image I created and be free.

For the same reason I'm scared of dressing better: I literally wore the same 2 hoodies for the whole school year bc I had no courage to wear anything else and hear people comment (even if in a positive way).

5)Taking things as a form of self punishment and bc I don't deserve things. When I go out with my friends I don't buy anything or try to spend less as I can bc I feel too guilty spending my parent's money, also bc my sister spends a lot of it when she goes out and I fear my parents may not be able to afford another child who does this. Additionally when we're on a trip I always compare what my sister buys in total to what I bought and always hope I spent less money mainly bc if I spend less I know she can get what she wants bc after all ""she wants it"" and I should sacrifice some of my joy for hers. Like when we went to Malta once and my father took us to starbucks bc he knows I wanted to get smt there, however my sister also came and ordered something and I felt too guilty to take anything so I just said I wanted nothing.",mentalhealth,_Just_asking_stuff_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1decoxe/what_is_it_and_is_it_serious/,1,2.0,0.0,4.2665847482395e-06

I hate change. a couple days before Christmas my parents got a new set of utensils and threw out our old set and I sobbed because now all are utensils feel different and they aren’t correct, even 6 months later I’m still not completely used to them. this is also not the first time ive cried about dish ware getting changed.

when I get overwhelmed I’ll end up pacing and if I’m really overwhelmed I’ll end up flapping my hands. honestly, if I’m alone I'm usually always moving in some way tho I find it hard to sit completely still.

I make eye contact so it can seem like I’m paying attention but I’m not sure if the average person consciously thinks that.

I'll have a hard time understanding and processing things and it makes me feel stupid. like if I don’t know if someone is going to talk to me and then they do I’ll probably have to ask them to repeat themselves a couple of times.

Mutual breakups still suck,1,1.0,2024-06-12 20:00:23,"Been with this guy for 5 months and I know it wasn’t that long, but it still sucks. I’ve been dealing with depression for 5 years and I cope by crying. My now ex deals with stuff too, but he copes by getting drunk and high on the weekends. I always knew we would break up since he was usually emotionally unavailable and I was insecure. To be fair we lasted 5 months longer than I thought we would.
He’s been with a lot of people, but he was my first real boyfriend. He is genuinely the funniest person I’ve ever met and really brought me out of my shell.

The last couples weeks were bad. I felt bad for him since I felt like I was suffocating him with my baggage, while he felt bad for me since he couldn’t give me the attention that I wanted.
The last day we spend together as a couple was fun since we just spent hours hanging out and laughing which was a nice change. I asked him later if he actually wanted to break up since we were thinking about it for a bit. He said that he felt neutral about it and said he’s pretty indecisive (which hurt since it made me feel like he didn’t really care about our relationship). I told him how much I liked him and how I didn’t want to break up, but that I don’t think I’m mentally stable enough to be in a relationship.
We decided to flip a coin, best of 3. Heads means break up, tails means stay together. 3 HEADS IN A ROW!!! We just started laughing, but I was dying inside.

How to deal with a manipulative selfish mother who puts on an image of a nice caring mom,1,1.0,2024-06-12 19:55:51,"
Hello, i am trying to explain a complex situation in as less words as possible. Please deal with me. 

Long story short, i was brought up in an arab muslim family but my mom is a foreigner and became muslim when she was very young. Her childhood was filled with trauma which i believe is what led her to making that decision and run away from the toxicity. 

I love my family (me and 5 more siblings in total) and value them and my parents very much. They are dear and close to my heart, but I can’t deny that we were raised in a toxic way, where not much freedom of expression was allowed without being met with grimaces and long lectures, we were antisocial and nothing was done to address that (quiet antisocial kids is not what i would call healthy). 

Although that’s all past and i dont live in my old country anymore, the problems are haunting me because my siblings still are, two of them are still in high school. My dad died few years ago and within a year and a half, mom married another man. At first i was hesitant, but she assured us she will never leave her family and she will spend equal time with them as with her husband. This was far from the truth. 

She changed 180. She completely changed her values and opinions and became ok with things that were not accepted in our childhood, she really confused all of us and mentally added a element confusion to the loss we were already experiencing. I think my youngest siblings would not be able to comprehend that change at their age. 

She now spends around 1 or 2 days a week with them, sometimes even less.

My sister is playing mom role… because she has no other choice, she is first year in uni!

My mom’s irresponsible behavior and her new “chapter” are deeply hurtful and bother me a lot.

Talking is out of the question, i tried and she had so many counter arguments and excuses, I’m not actually sure if she’s aware how toxic or manipulative she is. 

Tldr: mom puts an image in our heads that shes a loving caring parent, but her actions say the opposite.

"Without adderall, it feels like my brain won't turn on and function (prescribed for TRD, fatigue, sleep apnea)",1,1.0,2024-06-12 19:52:05,"Long story short... I have battled major depression/anxiety for over half of my life. I am 32 now. These last 4 years have been the most difficult years of my life. COVID hit (living in LA, CA so it was the worst), and then immediately I lost my Dad tragically and unexpectedly. He was everything to me. Then I lost my Aunt (basically 2nd mother) a few months later. My world was turned upside down. I tried to continue working a stressful job at an AI startup that I helped co-found but had to resign. Then I had a horrible snowboard accident, 2 damaged discs, a herniated/pinched nerve, and a severe blow to the sacrum/pelvis. Doctors during covid wouldn't do imaging so I didn't find this out until a year or more later. Then I reinjured my penis. My meatus (penis hole) has been slowly tearing over the years. It ripped significantly more. Went to doctor after doctor. No one said there was a fix to repair my penis.

I fell further and further into a deep, dark depression, mainly brought on by grieving but the chronic intense pain and no relief or answers made my spiral. In the past, psych meds had never worked well. For a bit then stopped or made things worse. I did intensive therapy, ECT treatment, TMS, and Ketamine, and even tried other meds out of desperation. Then I was prescribed Adderall off-label for TRD. It worked. It helped with the pain, put away suicidal thoughts, I could function, get back into treatment, and make music, wow! I'm not new to stimulants, meaning I've witnessed my brother with ADD go down that path of trying different ones. I didn't think I had ADD, maybe idk, but severe depression makes you feel like you do have it. Now, as some may know. Adderall wears off. There is a crash. Since I was depressed, the crash was unpleasant. More intense SI, anger, irritability. I've been on and off it for the past 2 years. I've gone lower and lower with some ups and feeling hopeful.

I notice now that when I wake up, it's almost like my brain is just off. I'm so slow. Hard to do basic things. It's hard to process, communicate, remember, and do the things that I need to continue doing to get healthy. Like treatment, exercise, preparing for upcoming urological surgery, being in the community, also preparing to go back to work, etc. basic life. I know I am rambling but it is such a love/hate relationship with this drug. I've tried and tried without it even for long periods do everything that would or can heal my mind, promote neurogenesis, and help me feel ""normal"" like it even works. I have Adderall xr 10mg and boom, I can function.

Is anyone else experiencing this or has it in the past? I'm trying to find natural remedies that mimic what the stimulants are doing to my brain. I'm also tapering off of Cymbalta slowly, I take gabapentin 3x a day, I have Xanax XR, and Xanax IR as needed, and tapering down on Seroquel for sleep. My goal is to slowly get off all meds but I feel like I need something else to add a buffer to negate the side effects/balance out my confused brain with all of the neurotransmitters. I'm not addicted to Adderall, will use it when I HAVE to be on, or I know will help in situations so I can function and not be a catatonic zombie.

Any feedback, ideas, thoughts, etc. - I am new to posting on Reddit but figured I would because I tend to find others that I can relate with.

There is nothing that I enjoy doing, even the internet has started to feel boring. I had gotten a girlfriend but ended up tossing her away as I always do and ended up secluded in my house with no one to hang out with. This has probably contributed to my thoughts getting so shitty. I don't have drive to do anything, I really don't want to do shit. I don't want to stufy cause I hate my degree, I don't want to work because who wants to, I don't even want to scroll.

I have exams coming up because I didn't study enough for the first call (don't know how exams work around the world, I'm from spain) and I just decided not to go. The rest of my exams went fairly well, I even got a 10 in one of my classes. However studying for this degree, on top of the fact that I just don't have the energy, brings me so much anxiety and sadness. I hate it, but my parents won't let me drop it. I just overheard my father saying that I'm a lazy entitled brat that just doesn't want to do anything, which isn't wrong, but made me feel worthless. I feel like I'm just taking up space by living rent free in my parents house and not studying enough. He said that I need to study for me, to get a good life, and I know I have to but I just really really can't bring myself to do it. I can't bring myself to do anything.

So I have never been to therapy and it honestly scares the shit out of me, because im afraid that they will prescribe me medication and that I will become dependent on them, but lately I have been thinking of contacting my GP to see if I can get a referral to a therapist to see if I can get tested for ADHD, but In reality I just want to know what the fuck is wrong with me, but I also don't want to sound like a spoiled brat.

- I keep forgetting smaller details, where I left my keys, or my wallet, or names of important thing after they just have been mentioned

- I lose motivation incredibly fast

- I have headaches almost every day

- I can't focus for long periods of time

- in the corner of my eye it always feels like someone is looking at me

- I see shadows move, Even if they are stationary.

- I am afraid that I will look like an attention whore for asking for help, and I often avoid asking for help as a whole.

- I feel like my emotions are fake

- I am not suicidal, but I have taught of hurting myself.

Is there more to it?? ,1,1.0,2024-06-12 19:19:34,"Hi!! 20F here, diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and it is extremely likely that I also have OCD (many mentions of it in medical records, doctor and psychiatrist have stated that they think I probably have it, but they are uncomfortable with diagnosing me formally due to my age :// (yay UK healthcare). However, I’m worried there’s something else going on with me, but my doctor isn’t really listening to me and tends to dismiss me. 

I’m ridiculously mood swingy and to very Extreme levels. Most of the time I tend to just feel neutral, fine, but throughout my days I’ll have ridiculously low lows (e.g. feeling legitimately suicidal over something incredibly minor, or explosive anger that completely shuts me down. However, an hour or so later I can feel completely fine and happy again). I unfortunately am also quite hot and cold with people - my friends I would absolutely die for, but typically when getting to know people, it’s so easy for me to become irritated by something minor and start to resent them, or, if I feel like a person is losing interest in me, I’ll be sure to ice them out first before they can do it to me. 

I also go through periods of time where my libido shoots through the roof and I become ridiculously hypersexual, and this manifests in problematic ways for me. (More risky behaviour, shamefully I’ll flirt and be sexual towards people I am not attracted to because I love the attention and validation. (E.g., I am a lesbian, but during these periods of time I will be sexual towards men, even though I don’t really enjoy it, because it is much easier to get that validation and approval). When I stop feeling hypersexual I am very ashamed and feel embarrassed and guilty over my behaviour, but the cycle repeats.

My emotions just feel very intense and difficult to handle, but my doctor keeps insisting that everything is normal. I can’t help but worry that there’s more going on here.

I want to be hurt.,1,1.0,2024-06-12 17:49:25,"Just general TW overall I think?

I (16) want to be hurt/ill. I think about it constantly, I've dreamt about certain scenarios, I make up scenarios in my head all the time.

I am fully aware that this isn't healthy, but I so desperately want it that I can't stop thinking about it. Though I don't think I'd ever act on any thoughts to deliberately put myself in serious harms way.

From what I can remember, I've always been this way, as a child I drew scenes in hospitals (though I'd never been in one. I've never been seriously ill or even broken a bone or sprained anything.). For most of my childhood whenever I'd go to sleep I'd lay and think about and make up scenarios about me breaking bones, and as I've grown up this had continued into serious injuries and illnesses. Though I've never told anyone about this, but the recent year or so the thoughts have gotten worse,  and to say the least I have planned ways to break my own limbs just incase.

Currently, I use Character AI to role play scenarios where I get hurt/ill, and have been using since the beginning of this year, before and still I look at pictures of ill and hurt people (possibly a bit disrespectful ik) and imagine myself there. It's everything from something like Anemia (which I hope to get somewhat, I know it sounds bad), to brain injuries, stroke, breaking bones, amputation, paraplegic, quadriplegic, being inconticent, even stuff that I can't get because you have to be born with it, etc.

 Though I must note I mostly only do roleplay the real serious stuff in the moment just to imagine being there, not fully wanting it. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose maybe my sight or hearing or speech. I don't exactly want to have a stroke, you get it. I just want to be hurt.. it's hard to explain. 

I have this weird feeling, whenever I do roleplays with amputation/breaking bones/paraplegic. It's a feeling in my legs really, like something is wrong. Also I almost always think about being wheelchair bound, just paraplegic... I feel like my legs aren't supposed to be healthy and something needs to be wrong. It's such a desperate thought the wheelchair thing, I don't know why I want to be wheelchair bound but I do. And the thoughts of it are constant and intense.

I know this sounds bad. And hell I can barley even imagine having to deal with some issues and/or being in pain constantly, but I enjoy pretending. Recently I've been thinking a lot about anemia, and reading a lot about it, as to how people get it and how you treat it. 

I know this isn't normal, I am very much aware. If anyone has any tips please leave any. I don't know if I should search help (I'd have to tell my parents and I don't want that).

Apologies to anyone who read all this😵‍💫

Never being satisfied with my own handwriting - is it just a personality trait or a sign of something more serious?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 17:30:25,"I always made every effort to make my notes and homework assignments look as neat as possible, but towards the end of high school, I noticed that no matter how nicely I wrote my notes, I was never satisfied with them. Even if there were no mistakes, nothing was smudged or crossed out, I would still find a reason why they weren't neat enough and why I had to re-write them over and over even if I was already behind on schoolwork and REALLY didn't want to write them again. If I didn't, it would bother me for the rest of the day until I did.

I thought I'd get over it after I graduate from high school, but nope! The same thing is happening with little sticky notes I put around the house with reminders of things my husband and I need to do (file taxes, go to the grocery store for something, etc.) It's something that should only take 30 seconds or less, but I can't put them up if they are crooked, written unevenly, or whatever else the case may be.

For context, I I’m 27F and was diagnosed with autism a few years ago. I looked into it myself because I diddnt have the support I should’ve when I was a kid and this diagnosis could have changed my life if they actually had paid attention because I am behind others who are my age.

I might not even get to do grad school still if I don’t get scholarships from the school living there. My plans are being completely rearranged and it’s making my autism go insane.

"Just venting, never did this before, you can ignore this",1,1.0,2024-06-12 16:56:28,"Hi, as the title says, Im just writing this message to vent, I just don't know what to do so Im doing this, I don't even care if anyone replies, I'm probably just writing this for myself. 

My mental health has been declining the past month rapidly. My mental pain is becoming physical. I'm starting to be depressed, I've never felt so lonely in my life, and I've felt lonely my entire life a lot, this is different. My mother is a narcissist who treats me so bad and she knows she is doing something wrong but she just doesn't wanna accept it and always makes excuses. It hurts so bad, I don't think I even love her. 

My girlfriend left me almost a month ago, she was the best person I've ever met, we (she) ended it on good terms. She said she thinks we aren't compatible and she's looking for someone else and we just don't understand each other, she felt like my mental health was too much of a burden because I had noone except her. It feels like it's all my fault even tho I know it isn't. She says that she saw how much I tried and that's why she was so sad about it. But she doesn't even understand how much I love her, she has no clue. Gosh Im embarrassed cuz I think I love her more than my own mother, maybe even my father, they have never been there for me like she has, and it's not even about what she gave, it's about her as such an innocent good person. She has such a kind soul and angelic eyes, I can't even think about her, how did this happen, why did this happen.

 I'm trying to racionalize it so much, I want to go into the past and repair everything even tho I've always been so kind to her and understanding, I poured so much of the energy into the relationship, I workout, I do thai box, I try to progres mentally and yet she doesn't want me, why doesn't she want me, I'm literally told my whole by women that I'm beautiful, I've always been understanding and good to her, I've cooked for her, I wanted to help her with everything, I cared about her more than I cared about myself (which is probably a part of the problem).

 One moment I had everything I ever had in the palm of my hand, and in a second it slipped and shattered and broke me like nothing could. The pain is almost unbearable, everytime I close my eyes I see my little angel. I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts, i don't know how much I can take, they are not a stranger to me, but they are not nice. Even tho I'm not gonna do it, they are coming back. I go to a therapist and even tho he's the best therapist ever, it's still so hard. I know noone is coming to save me, It has to be me, sometimes I feel like I don't even wanna save myself. She was my whole purpose to live, I feel like I don't even wanna live for myself sometimes, sometimes I do. I don't even know what to say anymore...

How can I (forgive/redeem my sense of confidence in) myself after a mental breakdown?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 16:23:10,"So today, I woke up dead tired, and I was dreading the hw questions that I knew I could do pretty swimmingly, because there is also a paper to write. It was one of those days where I was going to need physical support to sit in class, so I brought my instrument case with me to hold my head up. My Dad, minding his own business, gets excited it, and I freak out internally, as if I'd been seen naked.

In the garage, I have to literally trudge through a trail of garbage to get to my car and drive to class. My laptop doesn't work without a mouse so I have this string to attach it to my bag. I am severely autistic, so this is necessary, as I literally get overwhelmed having to carry both of these items separately in my hands. 

The car is also full of junk because I share it. As I put my bag in the passenger seat, the battery cover pops off and falls somewhere I don't see. Mom sticks her head in, and after having to work really hard to make her leave, I go bloody ballistic. I am flopping around the car, getting my limbs caught from a combination of adrenaline and fatigue, and I repeatedly call for siri because I misplaced my phone and I can't get there without google maps. 

Accepting that I am going to be late, no big deal, I am heaving as I throw stuff out onto the floor and into the trunk. I find myself shrieking and sobbing out loud as I drive (100% safely, mind you) to the campus. 

Another time this has happened was when I was trying to watch youtube while walking on a treadmill. Usually I had very good motor skills, I played piano at one point, and both multitasking and cardio were big hobbies of mine. But that day, I tried to prop the thing up and jt fell, and (nobody was there) that was the first time I screamed out loud. As people perceive me, I worry that although I feel squashed into bottling it up, it has always made me weaker whenever let it out.

I really desperately need some form of practice or progressable advice, because I will just randomly have very vulnerably low mental stamina. You can think of it as a crippled ability to get comfortable. My family can and has eaten away at crucial battles in my time management and self worth. On a bad day, my brain just won't work if I don't lay down or prop myself up in some way.

My concerns lately ,1,1.0,2024-06-12 15:48:38,"So , I met a girl in college and after spending some time and talking i found myself having a huge crush on her. Initially she seemed interested but the problems arised when I introduced her to my friend. I used to ask him for dating advice since I am very awkward when it comes to dating and expressing my feelings. Then he started to hangout with us. But after some time I noticed some changes , he started to get a little clingy and playful with her . I didn't really thought much about it as it was something he normally does around girls and it wasn't much at the time. But eventually These things just increased and her behaviour changed , when he was around compared to when I was. They were in their own world and i was just there present invisible between the laughters . If someone saw them it would seems like they're dating even though they're not . I was so confused and still am . My feelings didn't matter a single bit. Anything I did was not enough. Any care given by me was not enough cuz he'll arrive and save the day for her. I did try to express my feelings several times but every time it was either taken as a joke or me trying to pull her leg. I did do it properly one time but she just didn't answer properly. I even told him to stay away from her and respect my boundaries but he didn't even though he constantly bragged about it. He tried to hide it thinking I wouldn't notice but I did.

Do I have an ED?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 15:16:43,"I(18F) used to have no problem with food. It was just part of life and I really plaid no attention to it, until I hit around 14yo. 
-
My Mom had got a new husband and spent literally all her time with him in his room. She almost completely stopped cooking and left me, my 13yo sister, my 12yo sister and my 9yo brother to fend for ourselves. After a while of being hungry, took it upon myself to learn how to cook from online, with the first thing I ever learned to make being scrambled eggs. I don't know why, but everytime someone would walk into the kitchen or watch me cook, I got a little nervous, but it never affected anything and I'd continue what I was doing, but it always makes me want them to leave. I went on like this for a few years, but I was slowly getting more and more anxious when someone was in the kitchen with me. I also started to prefer to eat alone.
It went on like that for a little while, until these last couple of years. 
-
Now, whenever I cook and someone walks into the kitchen, I just stop what I'm doing and kinda cower down until they leave. I get super anxious when someone is close and especially embarrassed and upset when someone looks at my food. And I CANNOT eat in front of people. I just can't, no matter how much I want the food or whatever, I just can't. I also eat like 20 times a day, and I'm not talking snacks, I mean damn near full course meals! I eat even more when upset. I can eat till my stomach hurts and is about to burst, but then I'm hungry again like 20 minutes later. My stomach will feel like it did before eating and I get pekish. I Also can't stop myself when I get going. Like if I'm eating a bag of chips and I'm told to save some for another day, once I start eating them, I cannot stop and keep eating until they are gone. Doing this has actually gotten me into trouble acouple times.
I always feel bad about eating so much, but I can't help myself, it doesn't stop.
-
But the weirdest thing is currently happening. About five days ago, I moved in with some family. They are all super nice and constantly offer me food, but I refuse. I haven't eaten since I've got here. I'm starving and want food, but I just can't bring myself to eat here. They tell me to make myself at home and get any food I want, but I just can't. The most I get is a bottle of water from the kitchen before scurrying back to the room I'm staying in. I've never gone this long without food, and it feels so weird. My Aunt has even pointed out that I'm losing weight(I was 190 before I moved here) and have no clue how much I weigh now, but I don't see a difference. But then again, I constantly see myself different everyday and my body shape is different Everytime I look, so I don't know.

I was just curious if I could have an ED because my Cousin was talking with my Grandma about me not eating since I got here, and my Aunt chiming in that she didbthe same and it's because she had an ED.

Obsessions and scary thoughts,1,1.0,2024-06-12 14:20:27,"Hello.  I am worried and SCARED of myself, I might say.  I have a bizarre behavior.  I also went to the school psychologist, but it didn't help.  I've always been told that I'm weird, that I'm cringe, or that I'm childish or girly.  I always get criticized, but I don't know if what I said before is relevant. Sometimes I feel used and betrayed.  What SCARED me is that I'm daydreaming, so to speak.  I was OBSESSED with one song for 3 years.  I listened to it day and night, every day, I listened to it slowed down, I listened to it at high speed, covers, etc., I became obsessed with that song.  Since I was a child, I used to imagine if I was in the place of other cartoon characters and I would make scenarios in my head what I would do if.  And in the evening, I think from the age of 8-9-10, even before I went to bed, I imagined something to fall asleep.  Now, going back to the song, I always had scenarios if it was me singing it, if it was me in the video, if I was famous.  I kind of like being the center of attention, or that's what I'd like, although I can't stand talking to the world, because I find it boring and I don't understand their gestures.  The phase is that I found something on the net about maladaptivebdrreaming or dat dreaming and I found myself, but I don't understand why I obsess.  I, for example, in grades 5-8, had an obsession with the color gray and all my clothes were gray.  I obsess over different people, objects, things, drawings, etc.  I make scenarios, when I was little, I would lay in bed, look at the ceiling and imagine and even wave my hands.  I've noticed that I've developed an obsession with psychological anime and I admire psychopathic characters.  Please, I don't know if it falls into this category.  I feel like something is wrong with me and I can't even explain it, I can't make myself understood.  I call for help and no one hears me.  I am AWARE that something is wrong with me and I continue to live.  Sometimes I make scenarios if I kill myself, I even thought about killing myself until a child died on the street and I saw how much pain it caused the family and how the village started talking.  I need help but no one is here for me.  I found so many things on the net about being a psychopath, sociopath, ADHD, OCD, personality disorders, anxiety, etc.  But I can't make a diagnosis myself, although I have moments when I check 4-5 times in a row if I closed the door, put my glasses in the case or to check if someone is home, if I'm really alone.  I don't think I managed to cover everything I want to say and what is pressing me.  I can't say what thoughts I had cuz this post will be long , frankly, scary.  I fear.

I have no idea what to address first with my psychiatry assessment next month. Depression/intrusive thoughts/substance abuse/A(u)DHD,1,1.0,2024-06-12 14:13:51,"(using my throwaway account here for anonymity)

Hi there, 

I'm m/26 and I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for at least 14 years and living in Germany. 

I've been thrice to psychologists and psychiatrists (2019, 2022 and 2024) but most of them didn't seem to be of huge help. The only thing I've actually got from all those visits is that I was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, which is so far unmedicated. Also low-support need autism is running in our family's genes and I show tons of traits, but I don't want a diagnosis for this. 

The next assessment with a new psychiatrist is set in early July, but I hope to move it into June, because I'm really falling apart currently. In the beginning I had only set the appointment to medicate my ADHD, but as you'll read further there's a couple of more issues that really need to be addressed.

After a breakup from a three year relationship in February I fell into a deep hole again with returning suicidal thoughts, abuse of alcohol, reckless driving and intrusive thoughts (offending and sexually abusing others, self harm, suicide). Especially the mentioned intrusive thoughts are eating me up and I'm utterly disgusted by them, because I know that they are bullshit and would only harm other people. 

After nearly half a year I can say that I got mostly over the heartbreak, but the depression, the unmedicated ADHD and those nasty intrusive thoughts are eating me up.

I'm at a point where I can still handle everything, like I'll only drink too much if I have the next day off and also I wouldn't get in my car after drinking, but I have no idea for how long I can handle this. 

To my further situation, I've got a stable job in our public healthcare system, I'm living on my own with my cat and I've got a couple of friends I can call and visit on regular basis, but I avoid to do so because I don't really want to be burden to them or my mother. 
Also I'd consider myself compliant and self-aware enough to be left unsupervised without harming myself or others, so I'd actually prefer to do a therapy in our day clinic nearby. 

What should I address first? Even as a medical professional I couldn't tell for myself which problem has to be fixed first.

Thank you!

Failed to get into a good University ,1,1.0,2024-06-12 13:10:48,"I finished my bachelor's a year ago and took a gap year because I didn't plan out what I wanted to do. I had just cruised through life up until then fighting some major anxiety and minor depression and in my year off I decided I had to study for this national competitive exam in an effort to at least try and go somewhere prestigious for my masters. 

Except couldn't find it in me to study as much as I needed to. I only did like a month of actual prep. I managed to clear the exam, with a really bad rank (1922 out of ~14300). And it isn't good enough to get into one of the Good  Universities ™ in my country (I've already got rejected from quite a few of them).

Which means there's a very high likelihood that I'll have to go back to the uni I did my bachelor's in to get an MSc. And I'm dreading it so badly because my professors there (while reasonable people) have been making snide comments about how I wasn't good enough to go anywhere else and how I should have just come back instead of wasting a year. 

My parents are disappointed in me too. I made them spend money unnecessarily. And I feel so useless because of all of this. 

I keep thinking about how I should have just gone back to the same uni in the first place. At least then in another year I'd have a job and be able to pull my weight in the house. Or if I choose to take a year off, I should've studied harder, but instead I could barely get out of bed at all. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. Why can I not stop scrolling through Instagram even though I need to. Like I'm not even enjoying the reels I'm watching, but I feel so stuck. And now it feels like any progress I made to get over how much I hate myself has completely vanished. 

I just don't know how to change. I feel stuck and in a haze all the time and I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Everybody in my circle is doing so well, and I'm sitting here crying because I can't bring myself to do anything. I am tired. Of this. I don't know what to do.

"2 voices in head, one is really demeaning. How to stop letting it influence me as much? ",2,1.0,2024-06-12 08:57:29,"It's been going on for a while but I have this thing where whenever I think/ do one thing, a voice inside my head criticizes me. Its pretty easy to just ignore but I do think it has affected how i express myself. It's going as I make this post right now and saying that I'm stupid for going onto reddit as if I genuinely have a problem. Please don't shame me if this is just something normal ! sorry the post is long! 

  
BTW, the voice doesn't refer to me as ""you,"" the voice is me, so for example if I'm thinking ""Wow I am so happy"" the second voice goes ""why am I so happy it really isnt that exciting""

**tldr; second voice that always humbles me and downplays my feelings so I start to believe events/feelings are not that serious.**

  
I think it might just be intrusive thoughts, but it's a little different than that. The intrusive thought affects the main voice, and then the second voice is the one that says that I'm a cornball idiot for thinking like that. So its good and bad in a way, but really only has affected me negatively



Whenever something bad happens to me, I begin to pity myself or say that I have terrible luck etc. The second voice tells myself that I'm acting stupid or that whatever happened isn't a big deal and that I'm overreacting. Same thing whenever something good happens and I'm excited, but the voice says that its not that exciting or that things are going to go bad and it won't last long

  
I am really insecure about my body and face, so sometimes I look into the mirror and just stare at my self. If i call myself ugly, the other voice doesn't speak. 

However, if I question if I have some kind of dysmorphia the voice says that its not that serious and that I'm just trying to convince myself that somethings wrong with me. I try to stare for barely 10 seconds but the whole time i'm doing that the voice says I'm being corny so i immediately feel ashamed and stop



I feel like my body is terrible (which im trying to fix) because I barely can eat 1 meal and have motivation to do things yet can never get my body to move. I genuinely wonder what is up with my body but once again the second voice just says nothing is wrong with me and that I want a reason to pity myself.

  
is the voice itself normal? i can survive fine with the voice, the health and insecurity is its own problem. 

It basically just keeps me neutral and self aware, but I think I've had a tough time trying to express myself because of this. I haven't told my parents how my body feels and always aches and how I want to wake up early but I cant, etc. I cringe at the thought of going up to my family and talking about myself as if i WANT them to tell me that im not ok ",mentalhealth,overweight_,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de223c/2_voices_in_head_one_is_really_demeaning_how_to/,0,2.0,0.0,4.2665847482395e-06
Any mental health conditions similar to my ME/CFS crashes?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 12:42:30,"Please note I do not self harm or plan to. But I did mention ‘suicidal thoughts’ which is why I tagged it. 

I would love to see a psychiatrist one day to explore what other conditions my ME/CFS (chronic fatigue) crashes may overlap with. I thought I might post on here and see if any non-MECFS folk have similar experiences due to other conditions.

My biggest question is around conditions that can cause a quick onslaught of extreme negative emotions and thoughts, ones that are not consistent with your mental state outside of the experience. Ones that may be associated with sensory sensitivities and loss of body movement. 

My experience during my crashes:

A crash will usually be triggered by too much noise and light stimulation, stress, or over exertion of my energy.

I can feel it coming on as I become light and noise sensitive, and I start to lose movement in my body. I’ll need to lay in my bed in complete darkness with earplugs. At the same time as these sensory sensitivities I have an intense emotional reaction. My heart is racing, with crippling anxiety, but at the same time it’s like I’ve been injected with a depressive drug that makes the whole world in slow motion, and it brings up extreme levels of depression, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. 

It’s strange though because I have a full mental awareness of these thoughts and feelings. I can observe them come in and out alongside the other symptoms. I know I would never act on them but they feel very real. 

The experience will last anywhere from 1-3+ hours where I just remain in the dark with no noise until I start to come out of it. I can never fall asleep due to the high levels of anxiety. Though I wish I could. 

Once I come out of the crash I can monitor that the sensory sensitivities, negative emotions and ability to talk and move all improve together.

I’m then left in a kind of hungover state for a few days where my fatigue is worse, a little sad. But nothing like in the crash. It’s a very separate experience. Almost like the fatigue shuts down an area in my brain responsible for controlling and keeping in check every fear in my psyche or something. 

Also kind of feels like a bad drug trip or something. Honestly, terrifying. ",mentalhealth,bed-is-life,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1de5pqn/any_mental_health_conditions_similar_to_my_mecfs/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

Ever since she got divorced with my Dad in 2003, there was a three-year period where everything was okay. She used to clash with my sister quite a lot for over 18 years since she met her current partner and this soon stopped when she moved down south in the UK in 2021. She takes care of her mother full time and is also a full time carer. She cries pretty much every time I go and see her and won't seek any help due to family disputes and financial issues.

I lie to myself so much I dont know what’s real anymore,1,1.0,2024-06-12 11:31:10,"
hi reddit, I lowkey hate asking for opinions or advice, but I have no sources irl to go to about this and I just feel very lost. ever since turning 21 this past year, I have had numerous breakdowns because I feel that I dont know myself. everything I have ever known over the years whether it be my opinions, interest, feelings, etc. doesn’t feel like my OWN opinions.. like im lying to myself but say, think, and do these things for the validation for everyone else around me.
i’ve been reflecting a lot on my childhood and teenage years and realized almost everything I “loved” and worked towards was for my parents to be proud of me and for my peers to be impressed by me. I have stuck to these things for years and “perfected” them, but I feel so bored of it all but I constantly told myself I love it. now, it feels like maybe I hate those things but I also cannot imagine myself discarding and not doing those things.. so if I dont want to let go, do I love it?

overall, I feel like the hugest liar. i wonder if im lying to everyone and if I am lying to myself. I dont know myself and dont know how to get to know myself without the lies and constant need for validation.  this constant way of thinking is driving me crazy because I cannot stand being around me or anyone anymore so I sleep all the time to avoid thinking like this and feeling like every time I open my mouth to someone, im lying to them for their approval of me and using that to validate myself. I simply dont trust myself. 
I wish to feel so sure in myself that I KNOW what I like for ME, have opinions for MYSELF, and live for myself. but I am so confused with myself I just wanna ditch me and everything. not wanting to die but.. not deal with me. idk. have any of you gone through this? or understand what I am trying to say?

I push people away and I need to know how to stop running away from being close to people,2,1.0,2024-06-12 06:51:40,"I've noticed I push people away, when we talk I simply stop myself from sharing too much, when people wanna get close to me I start feeling overwhelmed even if they just send one text message so I end up procrastinating on answering them and end up forgetting after some days. When I put myself in conversations with them I hold my opinions and reactions, I won't talk to keep the conversation going, simply because I end up feeling without energy to even try. When people flirt with me I shut them down, I tell them I'm not interested and if they insist I end up not responding after a few days.

If I'm lucky enough to have people interested in continuing to talk I show the worst in myself, my insecurities, my biases, my unpopular opinions, just trying to have them stop thinking highly of me.

I have a hard time trusting people and I make the effort but it's very easy to lose my trust and they notice I don't trust them enough so.. yeah.

When I get attached to people I end up being very needy and.. that pushes them away

All the time there is fear involved and I make people drift away from me.

I do all of these when I try to protect myself and a lot of the times I'm also thinking: ""I don't want you to get too close and get hurt by me"", ""I'm too toxic for anyone to get anything good out of being in my company"" ""it's better when I'm alone""

While all this is happening she has been talking to Mark from Tinder Mark lives 4 hours away from Maddi and they made a plan to spend 4 days in Maddi's town to see Maddi.

I have now developed strong feelings and confessed them to Maddi. Maddi said that ""things have changed"" for her too and asked what i wanted. I said thay we both delete the apps, say goodbye anyone else who is a romantic/sexual option and give ""us"" a go.

She said she isn't sure and want to talk over dinner (the 17th June). She did say that that i can consider all her dating apps deleted. I asked her about ""us"" later and said i needed an answer because waiting is making me crazy. Maddi said that she wants to clear up some thing is thats worrying her (like ruining out friendship, her kid, and stuff) and just wants to be sure.

I feel so anxious and i also have so much guilt that my anxiety can't help me trust her. But should intrust her. But then again, if she is single right now, I have no business to know anything about her private life.

I hate that I confessed my feelings and Maddi will likely stop talking to Mark (or do it in secret).

I'm very lonely yet I push everyone away and don't want anyone near me,1,1.0,2024-06-12 07:46:58,"Late 20s. Struggled with depression for at least 11 years and I'm in a dark place.

I don't have any friends (my contacts are literally my parents and my brother), never any serious relationships, no acquaintances, never worked a proper job. I used to have internet friends though they either disappeared or I pushed them away. I had friends as a child though I became depressed and then when school ended they disappeared.

I have ALWAYS wanted friends and a relationship. I yearn for people to play games with, to be in a group chat with and to hang out with, and I yearn for intimacy and cuddles.

However, as soon as any opportunity for these two things this arise, I immediately feel awful. I literally never want them to talk to me again or come near me again. Nothing bad happens, there's no 'incident' - I feel immense guilt, shame, fear, anxiety. I will literally shiver and shake. I try and do as much deep breathing as I can over and over again and continuously reassure myself with calm and positive affirmations etc. and it does literally nothing.

Even the other day I tried to find an internet friend to game with through an app. Someone messaged me and they looked like the sort of person I'm looking for, and I immediately went into meltdown and 30 minutes later deleted everything. And this was for someone on the other side of the world who only said ""hey :)""....

I don't get it. It ruins me. It's stopping me from making any connections and it scares me how extreme it feels - it's not just a bit of worry, it controls me and overwhelms me, I freeze solid.

11 years of seeing therapists and trying all sorts of medications, plus doing my own research, has yielded no answers or solutions.

This means that I've stopped trying. I don't try and seek out things, I simply try and accept it... thus I'm very lonely and if I stopped going to the gym I would be almost completely isolated.

I kinda suck,1,1.0,2024-06-12 07:40:23,"
I dont have the right to be upset. I’m the cause of most of my problems . I don’t know how to communicate to people properly. How I am feelings is difficult for me to put into words when it’s really the most important. I don’t know how to fix myself. I am tired of messing up. I’m tired of bringing people down with me because I can’t figure myself out. I would be better off not in this world. It would’ve been better if I had never existed. My chest hurts. My throat hurts too. I hate feeling like this. Little things get to me so easily. I must suck to be around. That’s why people don’t want to talk to me. I probably seem unwelcoming. I never know what to say. I always feel like people dislike me but it’s probably just in my head. Maybe I’m not pretty enough to be approached, I know outward appearance also matters. I hate seeing myself in the mirror. I’m so ugly. Without makeup or my hair done I’m hideous. Maybe that is also what makes me unappealing and unapproachable. If I wasn’t so scared of dying I would kill myself but I’m too scared to. I feel so disconnected from everyone around me. All I do is cause problems for people. I have very little to bring to society and to other people’s lives. I’m a burden. I hate that people do things for me. I wish I had a career so I could just move out. I wish I could move far away. I wish I had someone I felt truly connected to. I feel so lonely all the time. I can never do anything right. What do I live for that’s actually valuable? I am no one’s #1. But I don’t have to be. But I want to be. I want so badly to be close to people but it’s so difficult for me. I wish I could explain my feelings better to people. I wish little things didn’t bother me. I wish I wasn’t emotional. I wish I couldn’t feel things because then I wouldnt react the way I react. I’m tired of working and I’m tired of school. I’m tired of always having to rely on someone. I’m tired of acting like a child. But I have childlike emotions and actions. I wasn’t like that before. Only now that I’m an adult, I’m here feeling and acting like a child. I am turning 19 in a month. I don’t want to be an adult. I’m so scared. There is something wrong with me. I’m not normal. I don’t want to live with my mom or my dad. They are divorced.

I can’t live alone. So what do I do? I’d rather die. I can’t do it anymore. I feel like I’m falling apart. Why do I do the things that I do, why do I act the way that I act. I wish I knew why I respond to things the way i respond. I wish I wasn’t a loser. But in the end it’s still my fault. I could’ve made different choices and I could I have done different things. So what right do I have to sit and cry. It’s my fault. But I hate self pity. And I feel stupid everytime I think about these things, and so I push them down. Because I think this is self pity. But this is how I feel. So I feel like I shouldn’t feel like this, it’s not okay. My head hurts really bad. I suck. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I want anymore.

Being overly emotional and just exhausted ,1,1.0,2024-06-12 06:41:38,"  Hello! I don't really post at all on Reddit, mainly just lurking on occasion. Forgive me if my formatting is odd, this is my first post. Just wanted to see if I wasn't alone on this, but I find myself to be a really emotional person and highly sensitive to certain topics.
  First thing that comes to mind if whenever I do end up talking about my own experiences or personal thoughts, I end up crying. This has happened every time I've tried bringing up my own mental health with my mother (to no avail, my aunt is helping me get in touch with a therapist, so yippee!) And I always seem to end up in tears. Another incident that was similar was when I confined in my school counselor about my worries about not being able to graduate in time and I was barely holding back tears at the thought of having to tell my parents about it. But, when she [my school counselor] gave me support. OPEN THE FLOODGATES! I guess it's just a lot of touchy stuff, but if anyone has any tips on maybe keeping these tears in? I feel like it really doesn't help my case with my mother, if her daughter is telling her stuff through tears and hiccups.
  In the case for the exhaustion, I just can't find myself to have any energy throughout the day. Barely enough to send my friends or my girlfriend a message to response to her goodmornings. I'm thankful that she's understanding of what's going on with me and my headspace. I've always had speculations, but could this be the long term effects of depression? I'd say I've been struggling with depression since I was in middle school, but only during high-school and now that I've out I think it's gotten worse. Any tips to deal with the mental fog?
  Also I do have thoughts that I might be suffering from other things (ie ADHD, autism) how would I exactly bring that up with my therapist? I would be more than willing to do testing, what worries me are how my parents will react if I turn up with something.

I've met with a nutritionist, I've gotten rid of food content for some time, stopped driving myself, and done tons of self reflection. I've even been doing self hypnosis. I've read every self discipline advice and have lots of knowledge, but in the end it can't seem to help me. Finally, my leg hip injury still bothers me considerably and hasn't seemed to really improve.

However, the food thoughts haven't gone away. I have a decent body fat percentage (though my parents say I look fine) and need to lose this weight fast before school starts in 2 months. I'm on an ROTC scholarship and need to have this taken care of by then, it seriously disrupted that. I am getting back from a 2 week trip to Japan with my Dad, and realized that the calories added up regardless and I allowed myself to overeat/binge at breakfast and lunch buffets today, because I wasn't feeling ""in it"" and was just thinking about food so much, and because I feel like I really failed (my chest fat is unbearable and it'll take a good bit more time to get rid of; haven't made any real progress). I already have plans of binging when I get back.

I feel pretty bad about this, but nothing seems to work for good. The thoughts are too strong, and I'm tired of feeling decent (or even just in control despite strong urges, or having it be tough but manageable). I was supposed to not eat lunch today but the hunger pang was too strong. My injuries aren't healed nor is my digestion, and since my weight has stagnated I'm not in a great places for fall. I guess I have to drop everything I've worked hard for because I need to binge.

I feel like I’m going insane,2,1.0,2024-06-11 22:11:02,"Hello, I just need to vent about this because it’s genuinely driving me insane and I don’t know what to do about it. 

So I, M19, am in university and I am in private halls. I have one friend who is also M19 and in my halls. Since I met him everything about me has crashed to the ground, along with the change from living at home to living at university.  He is important to me but I don’t think I’m important to him.  I have felt drawn to him since the start, but that has manifested in such ways that are unlike me. For instance, my brain memorised the sounds of everyone’s door so that I could recognise when he would come out his room, and then I would follow him out, which I didn’t want to do but it felt like I had to, like I couldn’t control it.  When he would socialise with others and not with me, I would lose it and cry and get so paranoid, then be so exhausted that I couldn’t get out of bed the next day. I have sought professional help, and it has helped, but the feelings haven’t gone away.  I’m able to control myself more and not follow him around, but I still get paranoid when he hangs out with others, although the paranoia is much more short lived now. It still distresses me though, and as I have been placed in halls next year it is making me fearful of socialising with the new people in case I start acting the same way, and I really don’t want to do that because it just pushes people away.   My emotions would cycle rather viciously each day at the start of the year, and whilst I have more of a handle on them now, I still have outbursts.

Everything that happened to me was against my will, things never went my way, I could never afford the things I wanted, I never had a girlfriend and still don’t, I never had that many friends and people always bullied me and discriminated against me as if something was wrong with me.

I’ve been done unfair, I was born against my will and had to go through this hell we call life against my will and never received any compensation for it, and now I’m supposedto just accept it and move on?

But that usually doesn’t happen. I haven’t cried in several months. I just persevere and keep on acting happy. I cried for the first time in months. I cried 4 times today. I go to school every day. I don’t do anything there anyways, but I need the attendance. Most of the time is just projects that I can’t find a way to do, or getting yelled at by the cooking teacher or the sewing teacher. We are not allowed to sit during cooking class. We also can’t sit when the teacher is talking. 

Today I couldn’t take it anymore. I usually never talk in last period. Today I said “John” over and over again in the last period, which was learning assistance. Other people started joining in and talking about “John”. I thought about how I wanted to see the universe and everything in it, and then I cried because I’m just a mortal that can only experience one life. I wish that fictional things were real, like I could just go on intergalactic adventures with friends, and see the most beautiful things, but I live in reality so I just eat the same thing every day, do the same thing every day, and then see other people get excited over things like “canned sausages on discount” or going for a run.

 I talked about Mackenzie, and how she’s either in “the land where missing people go” or she’s gone. I talked about how I didn’t want to say goodbye. About how I didn’t want to disappear like her. I listed all the people that I’ve met. I don’t even know who the heck Mackenzie is. I talked with other classmates about how I didn’t feel real anymore, and how everything didn’t feel real.

Am I different?,2,0.76,2024-06-11 21:43:15,"I'm a 20/F and I wrote this list of weird things about me at 1 am (Which may also indicate something).

I didn't find any other subreddits where this would fit better on so I'm just posting it here.

 • I often zone out in group conversations or when people have a lot to say to me. Words go in one ear and straight out the other. And sometimes I can nod and say yes even if I don't hear what is being said. Because I say it on autopilot. I know this sounds kinda selfish but I really don't do it on purpose.

• This zoning out also affects other areas, like when I'm watching a movie.

• I currently have an imaginary boyfriend - as a 20-year-old... His nationality keeps changing now and then.

 • I sometimes have extreme obsessions with characters from movies.  When I was in middle school, I was very fascinated by the raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy.  I daydreamed that I was a talking raccoon in a universe inhabited by multiple species and in the same situation as him. Maybe I could relate a little to his mental problems. Or maybe I just wanted to relate so I could justify my struggles or something. 

 • I forget completely basic things such as locking the door before I leave the house or taking my car keys and phone with me. Although I try to remember it.

 • Sometimes I can sit in a chair or wander around the house for hours on end while daydreaming about various things.  I can have an imaginary debate, imagine myself as an actor in an imaginary movie, imagine myself in a possible or impossible future job or think about some imaginary boyfriend and what our relationship would have been like.

• I think way too much about philosophical questions to the point where reality breaks. And I can't stop. All kinds of sensations lose its meaning because I know my brain is just making it up and if there were no humans, the universe wouldn't exist as we know it. And all kinds of concepts lose its meaning too because they're just built on other concepts which are again built on other concepts and everything is just energy but what's energy and it all started at the big bang but what created the big bang and so on.. I could go on forever about this. And I feel like it prevents me from enjoying the moment.

I don't think I have autism because I generally understand social contexts. Even tho I know  some of this can sound kind of autistic. I think I might have inattentive ADHD tho.

Traumatic experience with injured wildlife,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:54:00,"A beautiful buck deer was hit on the road by my house and the person didn't even stop. His back leg was broken, compound fracture and he didn't seem able to walk. I dragged him on my property out of the middle of the road in a blanket. A person who stopped said they were calling the police. However, no one came. I landed up calling wildlife rehabber who told me the deer might recover because he was overall not otherwise injured and they can sometimes recover broken bones. The rehabber told me to watch it and see if it moved. However, I think maybe his other back leg was also injured because he did not get up or move around. The deer landed up being swarmed by flies, so the rehabber said I could cover it with a blanket. I called animal control and fish and wildlife but no one was of help and no one came. They don't do rehab and the literal only option is to have police come and shoot it. Ultimately this is what happened, right in my yard. It was horrific because the creature seemed to trust me and had his head up and kept staring into the house before this. 

I feel like I completely betrayed this animal. It brings me back to when I recently lost my beloved dog to hemangiosarcoma. All day I have felt dead inside and am questioning the meaning of life. I feel like maybe I should have let nature take its course. Who are we to say what the animal wants. I don't think I would want to be shot dead with a gun. I am very attached to animals, feel immensely for their suffering and am not convinced shooting a deer is at all humane. I could not watch so I do not know how in pain he was and how long he stayed alive after. The whole thing feels so cruel and horrible and pointless.

I Don’t Feel Real. How Do I Work At This?,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:49:45,"Sorry for the vague title I just can’t really express how I feel exactly.

My best attempt would probably be that, I don’t feel like I am who people think I am? I just think I’m absolutely abhorrent, and I wonder why people want to be around me.

I’ve been battling back and forth in my head about cutting friends off because in my head I rationalise it as me keeping my moping to myself and keeping them from what I deem to be toxic behaviours in myself. I try to refute them but then I just rationalise it all over. 

Occasionally I’ll get this feeling of breathlessness, like I feel my heart sink when I consider that perhaps my friends lives would genuinely be better without me, I stop to consider what I offer them and I come up blank every single time.

I respect my friends agency and their choice to be friends with me but I just can’t shake the feelings and I really feel like I need to say, something. Recently I did have a small argument with some friends and I claimed I felt “infantilised” but really I was just working back from a conclusion and obfuscating the point. 

I mean this may be small but it’s gotten to the point that if I see myself in a mirror and think “I don’t look too bad” I feel genuinely disgusted with myself, I guess in short I just really hate myself. I can’t explain why, even now I hate that I’m writing this and I feel like I’m pushing a burden onto others, so apologies for that.

I feel I should note I don’t have feelings of self-harm or suicidal notions but I do often consider self imposed social isolation. Blocking friends, avoiding physical meetings etc. I just think it’s best if I am kept away from others. 

So I guess the main question is, how can I begin to fix this?

Panic attack TW: talk of s**cide,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:40:09,So a few weeks ago my bf and I were not having a good time with our anxiety. My bf has anxiety surrounding vulnerability in regards to his and his loved ones health and he chipped his tooth that night and he has no insurance. His panic triggered my panic and I had one of the worst panic attacks of my adult life (I’m 29) I said some things that I did not mean about wanting to end my life and my bf was really scared about that and he blocked me from going to the other room and was holding my arms down trying to prevent me from hurting myself. I was screaming and crying and in the midst of probably a twenty thirty minute panic attack one or possibly more of my neighbors thought I was being abused and called the cops. My bf and I both spoke with an officer separately and even though I felt a lot of embarrassment and shame i thought it’s over and I just need to use my tools and we both need to learn from this and start actively managing our anxiety better. Fast forward to today several weeks later and a lady that works in the building comes up to me and says she needs to talk to me and I’m already anxious because I don’t enjoy talking to this woman. She proceeds to say the cops were called  because I was screaming help me (which I did not say I was saying you’re hurting me because he was holding my arms after I said I was going to end my life; also trust me I know how this all sounds which is adding to my anxiety 😞) so I’m just basically like I already talked to the cop and I don’t want to talk about it with you because nothing happened. Again I’m fully aware how this sounds and I’m not able to speak more coherently to her because she basically just accosted with this information literal weeks after the event. Then she makes a thinly veiled threat to my bf who is not present that he is not on my lease and he needs to keep it down. And I’m just standing there mouth agape barely processing what is happening. Like not only was I not able to elaborate on a very complex and nuanced situation but I’m also being painted in a certain light that I’m far from comfortable about. After this she tries to make it about how she cares about me which if you met her and knew what she was like you would understand she does not. I am now perseverating on who thinks I’m being abused and aware that to the outside looking in it seems like I’m in a dv situation and that makes me sick to my stomach. They didn’t see my bf also helping me breathe when I was hyperventilating and holding me while I shook. It’s not fair that we both gave our matching accounts to a police officer and haven’t had any incidents before or after and this is how I’m treated and how my bf is being treated. Not to mention that he is the one responsible for paying rent and that we both have spoken to management together and because of that assumed they didn’t care that he wasn’t on the lease. I am at an absolute loss of what to do and I’m just trying to regulate my emotions and my bf is doing the same. I’m not even sure I want advice but it does feel good to release this from my brain. ,mentalhealth,General_Ad_1545,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ddtva1/panic_attack_tw_talk_of_scide/,3,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

Struggling with life and what it brings me 19m,1,1.0,2024-06-12 00:22:50,"I’m having a very hard time right now in life. I was arrested on a reckless driving charge and ordered to do 24 hours of community service which isn’t a lot but while working 48 hours a week and having no car makes it hard to get those hours in. I’ve been completely procrastinating completing those hours for the 6 months given to me to complete it. I did get to complete those hours with an organization but turns out the court does not accept those hours from that organization (doesn’t meet their standards). And now I’m left with only 5 days to get another 24 hours of community service. No other organizations that were listen by the court offer court appointed community service anymore and I have no other options left. I don’t want to go back to jail, I mentally cannot get arrested again, I can’t do that again. I work in a hospital as a OR CMA tech and am under constant emotional stress while working on patients and it’s taking such a toll with combining all of this with work. 

With all of that, I also want to say I’m a serial liar. I’ve lied my entire life to make myself look interesting and cool, ever since I was a kid no one liked me for who I was and or anything about me, so when I realized I could become someone else by lying I did. I lied about rowing for team USA in rowing, even though I did row but only for a high school team. I’ve lied I’ve worked at prestigious hospitals and helped operate in patients even though cmas do not have those types of skills, I’ve lied I was a bad ass kid in high school messing with the wrong people and coming on top. I’ve lied about being a really cool rally racer even though I just liked driving off road in my previous car a ford fiesta. I’ve made my self look like a completely different person and I know the lies will catch up with me one day. 

All my friend around me won’t understand my feeling or will help me which lead me to write this to tell my true story no one will ever here. I don’t know what will happened if the court finds out I didn’t complete the community service hours.

I have severe bipolar disorder that I am very good at bottling it up, I appear as a very calm person but what people don’t see is me punching walls breaking my belongings and beating myself up or just existing. I get overly mad for things that happen to me. 

One of my breaking points in my life was when in highschool my ex showed up to my house telling me she was dying and needed me to come outside to talk. I did and her friend shot me with a nerf gun (for senior assassin). She had brought 5 people along with her and film the entire thing. Including the part where I slam the door and punch a hole through the wall in my house while yelling.

After A died I started analysing what I did wrong or how I could have prevented their death. I worried a lot about other people in my life who also suffer from mental health problems. I could not afford to lose anyone else. I tried to be a good friend and listened to their problems while not burdening them with my grief. About one month after the funeral one of my friends who we can call B had a really bad day so I tried to be there for them. We texted a lot during the day, but things got worse and worse. B started saying that they wanted to die. Then they stopped responding. I called and called. No answer. My worst nightmare started to become reality. After a while B texted me back. They where alive.

After that night our friendship changed. At a time where I needed support I forced myself to be the support of others. But I did not have any choice really.  B might have died if I wasn't there for them. After what happened I begged B to get help but they didn't want to. (They said they would get therapy, and I offered to help them get an appointment. But it didn't happen untill several months later.) I worried all the time, I felt helpless. I was not only worried about B, I have a handful of other people who also was at risk of dying by suicide. I think i didn't grieve properly because of the responsibility of keeping others alive. I  ended up getting depressed and dropping out of collage. 

After some time on antidepressants I still felt like shit but good enough to get back to collage. I tried to stay friends with B. But sometimes I got anxiety after hanging out with them. Sometimes so bad that I wanted to hurt myself (sometimes I did). But other times it was fine, but never as good as it used to be. After some time, I became scared to spend time with B because i did not know how I would feel afterwards. And after a lot of contemplating I desided to end cut ties with B. 

I do not feel good about it. A lot of the time I feel like a bad person. From Bs perspective they reached out when struggling and then lost a friendship. If they struggle with suicidal thoughts again I doubt they will ask for help again because of how I handled it afterwards. I wish I could have been a better friend. I am still scared B will die.

Why is my dad a shifty asshole?,2,1.0,2024-06-11 19:56:54,"Why is my dad such a shifty asshole

So for context, today I had a very important exam that I partially passed, I will most likely repeat the failed part after summer and when I phoned my parrents their reaction were these:


-Mom: understandable, supportive and somewhat pleased with my results and everything I told her what my professors told me after the exam

-Dad: ""YOU DIDN'T PASS!?"", agressive (even though he said he was calm and then told me why I was yelling even though I just slightly raised my voice to get to the) word, talked down on me (would later say ""he didn't mean it""), overall ignores the ENORMOUS amount of work he is well aware that I've put into prepearing for this exam, calls me crazy that I am going to therapy and that Im just wasting time


Now why do I think he is so shifty? Well its mainly because he's been telling me quite often for the past couple of months, that I shouldn't worry if I don't pass the first time and that I just need a bit more time to get it. That is before he doesn't get pleasing results and just does a 180° and says that the only reason why I passed my 1st year exams was because my mom ""helped me"" (she didn't, I did most of the learning, she'd just ask me questions before dinner) again compleatly disregaring another exam that I did after that one and passed it on the 1st try.

I really, REALLY, R E A L L Y don't want to hate my father like he hates his but ever since I started college I've either fantasized about hurting him the same way he hurts me or just doing something terrible to myself since it's been fucking misrable (hence why I go to therapy).

Desperate and need advice,1,1.0,2024-06-11 23:41:00,"Hey guys, I need some insight for the time being concerning my mental health (seeing a counselor in a couple days and looking for psychiatry appointment too). I’m really freaked out and have never been a worse mental state.

To try to keep it brief, I got Covid for the the first time in 2021 and had some trouble breathing which triggered some anxiety (I don’t have GAD), but when the Covid was gone I felt all better. Then I got Covid again, and was prepared for the anxiety this time but also developed a hyper-awareness of my breathing. The months following I would have intrusive thoughts about my breathing that I tried really hard to suppress. Well, that worked for a couple of months but was still bothersome to me. 

Fast forward to last week, I was on vacation with my family and on Monday night I took a delta-8 10 mg gummy (I’ve done regular edibles a handful of times). I actually had a really good trip. My sister was upset she missed out on the fun and we took one again the next night, this time I was way less high but had no negative affects. I don’t know if this is relevant but I wanted to include it just in case. 

On my vacation this hyperawareness of my breathing became so intense that I started to worry. I thought to myself, “maybe I’m not the only one who struggles with this” and I looked it up (this was Friday night). Somatic OCD was the first result and realizing I might have it sent me into a mind blowing panic attack. I stopped eating for 3 days and was throwing up/ dry heaving non stop. I went to ER and by this point I was disassociating and was have seizure-like compulsions. They gave me anti anxiety and a sedative that put me to sleep. When I woke up the next morning I felt really tired and tried to go work. My anxiety started to skyrocket at work and I couldn’t function. I picked up my Xanax prescription and it helped me calm down for a bit and went back to work and felt okay for the rest of the night. This morning I knew I couldn’t make it through work without the Xanax and so I took one before I left and had a pretty good day at work. As soon as i felt my medicine wear off I began to skyrocket and have extreme anxiety again, what felt like rolling panic attacks. I don’t know what to do and I’m terrified I will never feel normal again. It’s been a week today since I took the second gummy so I am totally unsure if it’s related. I’m scared of losing my job, I haven’t been able to do a single house chore, and feel the most terrified I’ve ever been. Does anyone have any insight or advice until I can be seen by a professional?

It’s so easy to say “just go to therapy”,1,0.99,2024-06-11 23:20:20,"They just say that and then if you haven’t gone or things aren’t getting better they get mad at you??? What most people fail to see is that most therapists don’t do anything. One therapist I was with just listened to me talk for the entire time and then said okay go home. And then after a few sessions said there was nothing wrong with me and I don’t need therapy. Another therapist I had, she had this list of things that we would have to do every time. but we would never finish the list. It would always end when we just got through very very basic conversation. Anytime I tried expanding on things or just talking about things she would say I was going off topic and I needed to answer just the answer and only the answer. But all that is the answer. I felt so restricted about what I could talk about and most of the time she was talking. And then I had a therapist where there wasn’t a problem with her, I kept missing the appointments and it would charge me like $100.

He's done stuff like punching my little brother in the nose and giving him a nosebleed or picking me up by the shirt and slamming me against the wall. He is a kind man, but somewhat unpredictable. Like, when he is angry he'll make threats like I'll break your legs or I'll knock you out. I'm so angry and so afraid all the time. Also, though I live in a nice upper-middle class suburban neighborhood now but my family struggled before then. We had problems with our money and living situation. We moved maybe 6 or 7 times because rent was too high to the point where we had to buy the house from our grandma because we couldn't afford the current apartment we were living in. It was old and messed up, which eventually led us to spending some time living at a hotel. I am extremely grateful for my parents and their sacrifices but, these events have made a me a somewhat timid person. Though we are much better now, I still feel very alone and out of place. I don't want to act like my household is terrible all the time because it is not. But I feel the need to run to escape. It's a strong urge that I feel like a fight or flight response. And I get nervous over little things all the time. We act like nothing we experienced ever happened which makes me even angrier. All this stuff has turned me somewhat cold. My siblings call me this sometimes and can be afraid of me and express this. Because I'm ashamed to admit I've take this anger and fear out in things in bad ways. Like unaliving animals. I don't do this anymore. And I don't enjoy it, but I also don't feel any guilt from it. I am afraid of myself sometimes and how far I'm willing to go. Deep down I am compassionate, but basic emotion and compassion is not my strong suit. I did this because I needed to feel strong. I needed something to understand the way I felt. I wanted to be the one with the power. It was an escape for my anger. People at school only increase these feelings. Sometimes people will laugh at me, talk about me, and make fun of me. They sit there and laugh at my with smiles on their faces and say I'm weird and say that I stare to much or there is something wrong with me. I want to be kind I want to feel, but I am not capable of it on the level everyone else seems to be. I want to do something, but I can't.

How to learn a language associated with trauma?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 22:54:50,"Hey there!

For some context:

When I was a child, my family moved to a German speaking country. Now I'm not going to go into details, but I was abused by various individuals, especially those who were supposed to teach me German.

This culminated in me having panic attacks whenever I heard German being spoken. Ultimately stopping any chances I would've had at learning the language.

After 12 years, I managed to leave that country, with basic - intermediate German knowledge.

The issue is that I will probably move to another country where German is the primary spoken language, but I won't be able to converse or have a normal life if I can't learn this language. Every time I try my trauma surfaces and I can't focus.

"Shushing myself or saying ""shut up"" or ""you f***ing idiot"" out loud. What is this?",9,0.91,2024-06-11 09:18:08,"I can't afford a mental health professional and have mostly been just trying to figure myself out on my own but there are limits to what you can Google. 

I don't remember exactly when it started but the first time I really noticed this.. tick? Was when it started as a head jerk. 

I will be minding my own business and then my brain will decide to bring up a memory of something I did that I feel shame, embarrassment, or guilt about. I am a very visual person, I get lost in my daydreams often they are so vivid. So when I remember something, sometimes it's so vivid that I'm actually relieving the event. And then my head would jerk and I would wince, as if I was trying to literally shake it off. This went on from at least age 20-28, 34 now. It went away for a short period where I was really distracted and feeling okay about myself but then it came back sometime during COVID and it started involving me verbally saying ""Shhhh"" and then it becomes ""shut up!!""

My partner doesn't say much about it but I can tell she's distressed or thinks I'm maybe crazy and I think I'm maybe crazy too.

Constant Unbearable Pain ,2,0.76,2024-06-11 17:19:52,"Hello everyone, I just don't know what to do, I just can't get over pain of losing the future I fought and planned so hard for. Throughout college, I was dating this girl and we had a very serious relationship. She met my family (which all lives outside the country) so that was a monumental deal for me. We were each others best friends, etc, etc, typical love story. One day after graduation, we found out she was pregnant. It was a rush of emotions because I've always dreamed of being a father and this was my time to be everything I wanted to be. A husband, a father, a leader, a provider. It was the same month that I graduated that we found out so naturally my emotions were all over the place-happy, scared, nervous, anxious especially since I was just about to start my career as an engineer. It was sooner that I expected but I was ready to step up. Long story short, we lost the baby and it was absolutely devastating for us. Even though the baby was not born yet, the pain is unimaginable and I don't wish this on anyone. I would do anything to hold my baby girl right now. I ache for her every single day, its something you don't just heal from. I feel so connected to my baby girl but she's not here and it kills me everyday. Long story short, a few months later, we had a rough spot, I'm honestly not sure why, it just happened. Maybe the stress from me entering grad school and her entering more rigorous nurse classes? I'm still not sure. She ended up cheating on me and got pregnant by someone else. Now this is already absolutely soul-crushing as it is being cheated on, but knowing that our baby didn't make it and theirs did hurts beyond a level words cannot create. The guy is a terrible dude, he's already a deadbeat to one kid, has another kid on the way from his fiancee, and now has another one from the girl who I was suppose to marry. This hurts my soul so much because everything I fought for so badly got ripped away so fast. Its all I think about everyday, what my life was suppose to be and now its so lonely, so empty, so meaningless. I was suppose to be a father. I was suppose to be a husband. She was suppose to be a stay at home mom. But now, its just empty. The void of what was suppose to happen is ruining my everyday life-more so the fact I should be playing with my daughter. To make matters worse, I've only been in about 3 relationships in my life. This was my first ""real"" relationship but the other 2 ended almost exactly the same way. I've been cheated on in every relationship and it plays a huge toll on me mentally. Am I worth finding love? All 3 girls I was with cheated on me and then had a kid with the guy they cheated on me with. The other 2 were extremely short relationships (max 3 months) but it still hurts and I can't talk to anyone about it because its so embarrassing and I know people will make fun of me and I'm already on the edge as is.

All throughout my life, I’ve been describing myself as being extremely lazy. I had trouble finding motivation to do monotonous tasks like homework or studying uninteresting subjects, especially after finding comfort in video games. However, if given task seemed interesting or challenging, I would find myself fully immersed in trying to master it.

However, for the past few months my gf kept telling me, that I definitely have ADHD, and that I should seek professional diagnosis, to manage it, as it has been impacting me lately, causing me to lose all motivation, so much so, that even my hobbies stopped giving me joy.

Now, I haven’t told them about it, because firstly I don’t want them to see it as my excuse for my lazy behaviour and secondly I have hard time in general, confronting them about any difficult topic. For unexplained reason, it’s extremely difficult for me to ask them anything, as I don’t want to come off as ungrateful. On one hand, I do want to get diagnosed, or at least try. But on the other, the thought of trying to explain to my parents that I suspect I have ADHD, which I think they wouldn’t recognise as a problem but more of as an excuse, makes me very stressed.

Any tips on how I should approach this?

Tips for seeking FMLA leave for work-related anxiety and depression,1,1.0,2024-06-11 19:33:26,"Hello!

I'm seeking advice from the community on taking FMLA.

I've been seeing some conflicting information online, and am trying to get a few facts straight.

1. **PCP Sign-off:** I've seen some say that PCPs can sign off on FMLA easily, while others say that they may be unwilling to until they've referred you to a psychiatrist for their opinion. Is this purely situational and dependent on your PCP?
2. **Psychiatrist Sign-off:** Some people are saying that they were able to make an appointment with a psychiatrist, who was able to sign-off on FMLA right away while you receive additional treatment. However, the first two clinics I have reached out to have said that their policy is 3 sessions or 3 months of sessions before they can sign-off on FMLA leave. Is this the norm? Or should I continue to seek out someone who can help me quicker?

I've been in weekly therapy to help manage my anxiety and depression for over 2 years through BetterHelp, and unfortunately, my therapist said it's against company policy for them to be able to sign-off on this for me directly. However, if I sign a release form, they said they would be happy to give their recommendation to my PCP or a psychiatrist. This is helpful, but I'm not sure if this would even go anywhere.

Under normal circumstances, I would be fine with a 3-month assessment from a psychologist. However, I genuinely feel like I've reached my limit with work, and it's spiking my anxiety. I'm days away from quitting if I can't get FMLA leave (which I understand may have other career-related consequences that I've given a lot of thought about and am willing to risk), so I really don't think I can wait this long. It's just not worth sleepless nights and chronic stress, and I want to move on.

I have a few appointments lined up, so ultimately, I will have more info soon. I just wanted to make sure I was going about this in the right way and have the right expectations for this.

How do I stop dissociating?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 19:14:39,"I was in an extremely abusive relationship for 5 years and during that time I believe I was dissociating for the majority of the relationship. If it helps at all I am autistic as well as have ADHD. I plan on going to see a psychologist here soon again as soon as I have the money for it. 

The trouble I’m having is that I believe I am still dissociating at times, but possibly don’t know I am doing it. What freaks me out is that my brain “replaces” uncomfortable memories with positive interactions. That is the best way for me to describe it. I actually don’t know if that is considered dissociation or something else. 

An example:

During my abusive relationship my ex had to remove some flowers that I loved and would tend to every day. He HAD to get rid of them it wasn’t something that he was doing to intentionally hurt me. When I say I loved those flowers I mean I LOVED them. I didn’t have much left that was mine at the time. From my recollection I told him I understood and helped him do the stuff that had to be done and I was fine with it. Fast forward a year or so later he brings up the time I had the “extreme meltdown” over the flowers. I tell him I didn’t have a meltdown I was fine with it and understood why. He is adamant that I had a meltdown and at that point I thought maybe he was just gaslighting me. Well I’m talking to my mom the next day and tell her about him saying I had a meltdown…well she confirms that I did in fact have a meltdown. 

I still to this day have no memory of a meltdown and in fact have a distinct memory that everything went fine.

Now back to the current time. I’ve been out of that relationship for 4 years now and have been in a great healthy relationship for a little over two years. When I get stressed with work and life I find myself discovering that it’s possible that I’m doing what I did before. My partner will say something happened and my memory of it is different. It is very upsetting for me, but I believe him because I know it has happened before. 

Is there a way to track this or to stop it from happening? What is happening and how do I correctly relay it to my next psychologist?",mentalhealth,None,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ddmfy0/how_do_i_stop_dissociating/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

"Im lost, dont know what to do anymore.",1,1.0,2024-06-11 18:02:47,"I am lost, I feel like life isnt worth it anymore.

I'm 27 and still single. I've been single for the past 10 years. I have tried so many times to find someone, but it always ended before it became a relationship. I have asked them if I did something wrong, and I always get the same answer: I did not do anything wrong, but they just didn't want a boyfriend at the moment, even when they dragged me along and played into it.

2 years ago now, I got really close to a girl who had a child, I got really fucking attached to this child, and he got attached to me... She promised me day in and day out that we would be together... One day, she texted me and said she needed to stop talking with me... That was the lowest I had ever been, and I just wanted it all to end. I was there for her and her child; I even came running at night when she had panic attacks, even when I had work the next day. I pushed everything in my own life away to be there for her. I miss her and the child.

Since then, people think I am doing better, but I am hiding how I really feel. I started working out 4 times a week at the start of the year, which helps a bit, but the loneliness still haunts me... Every single night, I want to drink or wish I had meds to get high and away from everything.

  
I don't know what to do anymore. I keep telling myself it gets better, but it hasn't gotten any better for years now. The only time I was truly happy again was 2 years ago because even how stupid it sounds, that child made me feel like there was a reason to stay alive because I felt loved by him, always smiling when he saw me and got all happy... Damn, I'm tearing up again now.

I've been thinking about ending it all, but I keep on going every single day, even when I want to give up on everything. I just feel like I'm getting closer and closer to the day when I end it.

I am currently a 27 year old male, I have no friends and I live alone because i am single. When i was about 7 years old there was a 2 year stretch of time in my life where I was raped often. I grew up pretending everything was ok when in reality it wasnt. I was bullied SEVERELY in school to the point of going to the hospital numerous times as well as constantly being told i should kill myself or just not exist. I have tried 4 separate times to kill myself and even succeeded once but was revived.

I'm not sure if its because of those things or if I'm just making excuses but i am constantly struggling with the voice in my head doubting myself over every little decision i make and everything i do. to the point of it interfering with my work ( not that that matters its just a minimum wage retail job cuz i cant get anything better) 

I dropped out of my university twice because I kept thinking that I was useless and wouldn't be able to accomplish anything.

I need to be better,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:57:01,"Suggestions, strategies needed.

I’ve come a long way in my mental health, anxiety and depression. I’m a mom and a wife and live in a country that is not my own. I have no strong family ties but I have made a few friends here. 

My husband got very frustrated with me recently, saying I need to take more control of my mental health. I am currently not taking medication or in therapy. I am uncomfortable with medication and all the local therapists have massive wait lists.

I take care of our kids and do all the household jobs. He is frustrated that I lm too tired to work on the farm with him, to work on the paperwork side of the business (he won’t do paperwork) and that I don’t have any hobbies. He says I’m just a sad lump on a log and he isn’t looking forward to being together for the rest of our lives if I can’t be a better, more productive person. 

I do cope with things by shopping. I’m insecure about my body after having kids and hitting my late 40’s. I buy lots and lots of clothes we can’t necessarily afford because I just want to not look awful in something. I’ve started working out and I’ve lost some weight finally, but he’s upset I’m doing that instead of getting outside and working on the land. 

I know I need to work outside more, I know I need to stop shopping, I’d love to make art again like I used too before the kids and the business. I’m just exhausted. I have to start waking up at 5 with my husband from now on. I also need to be calmer and stop taking my bad moods out by yelling at my kids or saying hurtful things to my husband. I’ve stopped  myself from having panic attacks most of the time, even when my depression is hitting hard I still make sure the kids are well cared for. I have a lot of good coping skills too, but I’m not sure how to hit the next level of getting better.

Struggling with Chronic Pain and Mental Health at 30,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:55:35,"Hello, I’m 30, male. I don’t know where to start or why I’m writing here, but whatever. I’m having increasing trouble getting through life. I broke up after being in a relationship for 5 years, and 4 of those were rather unhappy. I’ve been feeling progressively worse, both physically and mentally. Because I swallowed my anger and dissatisfaction all those years, I felt empty and lost. I thought the breakup would be the best thing and that I’d feel better because of it. 

Now, four years ago, I got sick. At first, I didn’t know what it was, just had pain all over my body. Some days, it was almost impossible to dress myself. I could barely move my neck for almost a year, which was unimaginable to me since I was always sporty and agile and never had such problems. After countless doctor visits and tests, it turned out to be ankylosing spondylitis (Spondylitis ankylosans is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease. It primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints but sometimes also other body structures), and also hip dysplasia wich courses pain in the hip area. I got medication but The pain was bearable, sometimes better, sometimes worse, but there was always a slight stiffness in my body.
I also suffer from tinnitus, which I’ve had for almost 15 years, and it significantly worsened last year. It’s like a 24/7 distraction in my head, and I got used to it but now that it got much worse making things increasingly difficult. My mind doesn’t come to rest.

I feel increasingly lost and, in my early 30s, physically and mentally at my wit’s end.

In the past, I would have told myself, ""Okay, take fewer drugs and take care of yourself, then you’ll feel better again,"" which I did. I joined the military, was sober, exercised a lot, and was disciplined. All of that has largely been lost in everyday life. I mean, I eat healthy and stay active by doing sports. I still occasionally take drugs, but only on the weekend with friends, within limits. 

But I’m getting older, and the physical issues are getting worse. It feels like my body is giving up at just 30 years old, leading to mental problems, and I can’t just tell my body to stop being sick. I feel worthless and ugly because the signs of aging are visible on me.

What should I do in this situation?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:48:27,"I am 19 yo, and I am having a hard time in the second semester of university, and that ranges from:
- 
-
having anxiety at mechanic class (the teacher manages to make it a living hell despite me sitting in the front, writing everything on my notebook and studying, but since I am recovering from burnout, it's now harder, and that makes me procrastinate sometimes due to not being able to focus and study at home)
- 
-
trying to uncounsciously avoid the next day by sleeping late
- 
-
beginning to stay at university to avoid home (I think the reasons behind that is that my family knows I am having a hard time at university (this course of mechanics is making me and my classmates to study exclusively for the course tests, and I believe that more than 75% of the class won't pass this semester in mechanics alone) and completly ignores it or (in case of my sibling) tickles me when I am trying to rest or procrastinate (wich pisses me off, because I am believing it's because they think it's laziness, and not me having a hard time) and asks me why I won't play with them or even asks if I am really going to study (wich drains my mood even more), and for the rest of the family members who lives with me, asks me to help with mudane things when I am studying and my sibling is free to help them, and even becoming mad when I refuse (wich obliterates my study routine) 
- 
-
my family disliking my hairstyle and clothing preferences (I lived my entire life untill 17 yo using the hairstyle and clothing they wanted, but nowadays I am exploring what I enjoy. But I can't still negate that this is impact my life, since it's relatively common with subtle things (like saying my fringe is covering my eyes and will hurt my vision or laughing at me for using a clothing or hairstyle that is different than what I used to have, or even asking why I don't show my forehead (the reason being that I disliking the style, but they won't listen) and saying I shave everyday (wich is far from true, but they won't listen that I dislike having a beard or body hair other than my head hair and that very likely it won't change) 
- 
-
my grandparent who lives in my house dislikes criticisms or being pointed out as being wrong, and is a controlling person since the time of raising my parent
- 
-
I am starting to believe that they are indirectally blaming me for not going to pass the course and loose my scholarship (I can't deny I could do better at the beginning, but feeling that they are ignorating my attemps to improve and my huge growth that I had and not even supporting me emotionally is infurating)
- 
-
I want to help them financially and to make them have a better life on another country after graduating. But their behaviour and the fact my graduation will be slower is also impacting me (my uncle and aunt said they can help me if I don't pass, but I am worried about their finances even thought my aunt has a profession that pays good in my country, and honestly, I know somewhat what to do if I don't pass, but I am afraid of getting stuck again in the same situation when retaking the course or studying in another university
- what should I do to atleast have a slightly better time (even if it's on the next time)?

-
tl, dr:
- I am having a hard time at university (despite my attempts to improve it), i feel that my family doesn't help, and I want to ame my family have a better life

Does Trauma ever really go away? Am i crazy?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:30:37,"As a kid, I was abused by my mom, mostly emotionally but with a few moments of physical (I think, I wasn't ever truly beaten but food was withheld commonly and I was underweight when I was kicked out of her house when I was around 11, to which i went to move in with my dad.) I had it decently with my dad but he pushed me to be extremely independent, and thus (and this is what my stepmom has told me) not really have a proper childhood. When I was 15 i cut contact with my mom, to which she freaked out (She has borderline personality disorder that's mostly untreated if that helps in describing her actions and mannerisms), and there was a huge fight but I ultimately won. Shes done some other stuff over the years, such as sending me an email while I was at work (age 18) on why it was my fault that she tried to commit suicide, and I also found out later that my dad was not even my biological dad, and the list honestly goes on. Also after the years that I moved out she refused to let me talk to my sisters, claiming I was a ""threat"" to her family and that everything that happened was my fault. 

My dad put me in therapy at a young age, because he didn't know exactly what happened with my mom and I didnt realize that what happened at the time wasnt normal behavior. I got iq tests, diagnosis and inititally I was diagnosed with abandonment issues before eventually being diagnosed with trauma induced depression. 

  
My therapist always praised me for how well I managed it, and at the time I agreed, but now that i'm older (22F) I don't feel like ive managed it well at all. My memory is awful, and i can't remember anything until I do if that makes sense. Ill have moments of clarity and then ill spiral. Im also married now, with a 1.5 year old, and my husband always argues that if i can't rationalize why i feel a certain way, then i shouldn't feel that way at all. I wish he would just let me be upset sometimes but he always gets annoyed if I am. It doesnt help we have been rocky due to some internal issues of not feeling loved, but part of me feels like i want too much. Lately I just feel like a child, I want to cry all the time, and I just feel so isolated and lonely. I find myself with a strange urge to go home, but I'm not really sure what that even means. I guess my question is, is this feeling ever going away? I don't like medicine because I can never really remember to take it consistently, but im really consider going back on it (I got off when i lost insurance at 19). I want to be a good mom too , so i'm desperate to get better. 

Is it wrong to still blame my mom for these feelings? Could I have more than just depression?

How can I regulate my newly super dysfunctional emotions?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:14:25,"I’m in my early twenties (F), and have quite a lot going for me. I am surrounded by a proper community of family and friends with whom I have built very strong and genuine, loving relationships with in the past few years. I have been blessed with work opportunities to do what I am truly passionate about doing. 

But it feels as though a switch has gone off and I am told by those who are the closest to me that I am acting unlike myself. My emotions feel incredibly dysfunctional, and I can tell myself that I am not centered. 

The simplest way to put it is that I have gone from being very lighthearted and free spirited to very negative. I complain about everything or feel numb/could care less about anything. I care very little for potentially building new friendships and even in social settings, regardless if related to work, I don’t engage in conversation or entirely seclude myself physically. Then suddenly I’ll be super positive, back to my “normal” self, laughing and joking around as if I’ve done a mental 180 within the next hour or within the next day. Only for that to completely regress into a heightened emotional outburst that can be quite aggressive verbally due to being “triggered” or stressed/angry about something. Doesn’t have to even be major, just enough for me to be ticked off. 

It’s exhausting and unlike me and I see how it is toxic and exhausting to those around me. I don’t know what’s happened, but it’s beginning to make me think very bad things about myself despite everything in my life being a dream come true. I can tell something’s wrong, but I’m having trouble catching myself and fixing it. My emotions tend to overpower my logical thought.

There can be several reasons for this. I’ve had a lot of stresses due to major recent life changes but tbh even those I feel like I should be able to handle and not let the stress get to me because they’re all really good majors life changes. Throughout my life I’ve had some pretty traumatic events happen to me, however I’ve worked through them due to counseling/working through it with my partner, and I don’t see how they could be causing this. 

At the bottom of my heart, I know I’m happy. I feel like I’m in a constant battle with this weird version of myself and I’m so tired of it. How do I regulate my emotions?

please please help,1,1.0,2024-06-11 17:06:07,"

Brother’s (21M) behaviour is concerning. He wakes up angry very often. Small things anger him, which seem to anger him to no limits. He will fixate over small problems that occur in daily life (such as shirt being wet) and hold on to this/ be angry about it for hours. He is in a terrible mood every single day, probably since years now if I’m being real. He doesn’t enjoy interacting with anyone from the family. He is rude to people who try to talk to him. He does not want help from others when he is angry or irritated. He isolates himself, acts depressed, and then goes to sleep for hours. When asked about anything, his standard answer is ‘nothing’. He takes no responsibility around the house nor does he listen to others when they ask him for his help regarding anything. He is extremely narcissistic and self centred with little empathy. He has some good moments during the day, which are extremely rare. What I’ve observed is that he has a lot of constant highs and lows. More lows than highs though. He doesn’t know how to manage his emotions and constantly argues with anyone when they try to talk it out with him. He is disrespectful and raises his voice, leading to no productive or constructive conversation/criticism most of the time. Needless to say, he does not communicate with anyone. This is probably out of choice since we have prompted him to seek help from us multiple times. He does not realise how his erratic behaviour affects others. But if it doesn’t change it’s likely to break the family apart. When we speak to him about it, sometimes he completely victimises himself and spirals while blaming himself, leading to another depressive episode. He also punches the walls and throws things around when he is pissed off. Small things trigger him which cause hours long of bad mood, anger, depression and the cycle repeats. It seems like he has deep resentment towards everyone, for no apparent reason. Our existence simply is a disservice to him and we are all an inconvenience to him. That is what his behaviour communicates to me.

Any advice is welcome. If you have faced a similar situation, please let me know how you overcame it. He probably requires professional help but what kind? Kindly recommend. Does he have some sort of disorder?

"I imagine things, what's wrong with me?",1,1.0,2024-06-11 16:56:41,"[SLIGHT MENTIONS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE]

So the question is ""what's wrong with me?"".
I would like to know if the problems I will list are symptoms of something.

To clarify, I'm a minor (soon adult) that has never been to therapy. I've never in my entire life seen a specialist or been to a hospital. My parents think it's a waste of time.


The problems are affecting me greatly.

Throughout my entire life I've been imagining people watching me. I do not mean real life people, but imaginary people that usually appear next to my windows, inside my house. They make me feel judged, I always tried to restraint from doing anything they would deem weird.
Usually, they take form of my favourite characters (I find comfort in cartoons and shows) so it feels worse when it's ""someone"" I look up to.
My family was already calling me a weirdo and thinking I'm useless. So I was wondering if this affected me so much, it spread to fictional characters? I can't stand being next to windows. I know they're not real, I want to believe that they're not real.
Over the years I started to get used to it, so I'm less affected by it. I think it was at my worst at ages around 5-7 and 12-14.

Another problem with imagining things; the screams I hear.
Often when I leave my house, I can hear screams coming out of it. This only happens when I know my father is awake, because if anyone screamed in pain it would be because of him.
I have a little sister, and every time this happens I just freeze in fear and I'm petrified. What if something really happened? Me and my brother are the only ones who got abused to this extent as little kids, she's not been in that situation yet, but I can't keep thinking of something happening.
I usually calm down, but then I'm late for school or work, and it's been affecting my education greatly.

Another case of imagining things, I feel presence or I see dark figures at night. I am convinced I will get hurt or killed or worse, though most of the figures look too inhuman so I sometimes have doubts if they're real.
Right now when I'm writing this, I know they're not real. But literally every other time I am actually scared and I feel as if it's real.

I was thinking if me imagining things was some kind of a mental illness? I am not able to be diagnosed, and I don't talk to people (I often limit myself to hand gestures) so it's hard for me to get any kind of help.
My grandmother has a really bad schizophrenia, she isn't even able to have normal conversations.

Or all of this might be because of the abuse I've gone through, I'm assuming.


I might make another post describing my other problems, and I would love to find out if everything is somehow connected. I am not a fan of self diagnosis, but this is the only way I can take a first step to help myself.

Should I tell my parents about sh?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 16:47:36,"My parents aren’t best with mental health. They themselves have problems but they don’t treat it seriously, though I haven’t had any serious talk with them about it in general. I don’t think they’d believe I have issues myself.

I need recommendations on coping with emotional dysregulation stemming from ADHD. ,1,0.66,2024-06-11 16:36:24,"I've(23f) had ADHD for years, but was actually diagnosed in the last year. it's caused me anxiety, depression, causes me to have issues making friends, makes it hard for me to trust, issues with cleaning but most recently, emotional dysregulation and anger issues. 

I've always kinda had anger issues, throwing things, yelling, cutting people out of my life, etc. but between that and my emotional dysregulation, I feel like I'm going to lose my 4 year long relationship. we will get into an argument, and seemingly it doesn't matter what it's about, I just shut down. I get choked up, I cry, I do my best not to yell, and I feel physically incapable of talking. this is where my bf(32m) doesn't quite get it. he also has ADHD but has had an extra 9 years to navigate the world and find coping mechanisms. I really love him, and he says that he still really loves me, but we're walking on a very fine line together and I feel like any second could be the last together. 

so PLEASE, how do you navigate emotional dysregulation/anger issues/trust issues/etc, with ADHD? I would love to go to therapy but I can't afford it. I want to make things work with him, I want to make things work with myself, as I've been very unhappy with myself for a long while now. any coping mechanisms, free therapy, ways you and your ADHD partner navigate stuff like this, anything?

"My partner has significant mental health concerns, and I just need support. ",1,0.67,2024-06-11 16:25:11,"The relationship I’m in is fairly complex and has been very rocky. We’ve only been together for 10 months now, and during this time they have had several instances of deep depression along with multiple expressions of SI. They are on medication, but due to insurance issues and America’s deplorable medical system, their meds have lapsed a few times. They have also been inconsistently seeing their therapist for the past 5-6 months. 
And I am burning out, quickly. Throughout this time I have struggled with my own mental health issues, not to mention going through the process of a divorce (different relationship), along with life’s just typical stressors/challenges. I have a background in mental health but since this is so personal, it’s been extremely hard to practice what I’ve learned, paired with the fact that I cannot be my partners therapist. There have been so many good times in our relationship and I love them very much. I don’t want to end the relationship but I am at a loss. During the “dark times” they have said and done some relatively unkind things to me personally and I have chalked it up to them struggling. But, I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, terrified that I’ll receive a call that they’ve done the worst imaginable thing, or them slipping into a state of rage as it is their typical response to a trigger. I am extremely sensitive to people’s rage due to past experiences and trauma, so this adds additional pain to the situation.
I feel I can’t turn to my friends or family for support because they say “just break up with them” and it’s not that simple. I’m invested, I love them, but I am hurting and feel my “shine” dimming. I feel like I can’t heal myself because I’m always on standby for them. It’s an ugly pattern of things getting better for a few weeks, which convinces me to stay and I begin to feel some security, then bam, outta the blue we’re back to square one. I can feel my patience and empathy dwindling too, and don’t always have to capacity to listen to them when they are more than venting.

I don’t really know where or how to start but I’ve definitely had high anxiety for a very long time. I constantly over analyze everything that I do and even everything that I think; with just about all of these actions and thoughts I end up thinking about whether or not that’s what is morally right or if that’s what a perfect person would do, I subconsciously do this during/immediately after I do or think things and even when I’m not doing anything I still analyze what I should be doing and how I should be doing it. It even happens with the smallest of things. I also have a lot of things that I feel like I want to accomplish but I can rarely take action.

I have a problem,1,1.0,2024-06-11 15:26:06,"I'm posting this again because I really need advice and directions. Hi, everyone! This is my first time posting on Reddit. And I'm not how it can help me but I've decided to give it a shot. Before I begin I just wanna say that English is my second language so there might be some grammatical mistakes here and there. This might be long so bear with me. So my problem began over 2 months ago and it's been making me crazy. Over 2 months ago I heard this bizarre story on YouTube through a story narration channel. You know those channels where they use AI voice to read stories that are written in reddit formats. With the #s for algorithm and no source provided of the original author. Anyways when I found this particular story my gut kept telling me not to view it but curiosity got the better of me and I did and well, it went down hill. Firstly, I started looking for the source of this story and saw that it was nowhere on Reddit or any other platform. Nobody in the comments could provide a link or confirm if the story ever existed on Reddit. Now, I'm 100% sure the story is fake and was never on Reddit. It has a lot of inconsistencys and plot holes and the premise itself is bizarre. But the problem was that I became obsessed with it. To the point I sort manifested myself as the main character. I started to feel their emotions which were heartbreak, pain, anxiety, betrayal etc. all of these emotions are overwhelming me and I'm sick of it. I wake up in the morning sad and I often get triggers. I picture some of the characters in people around me. And it makes things worse. Even in the last few weeks I was able to thin it down and get over it a bit but my mind keeps relapsing and in the last couple of days it has become hard. I came here because I was very overwhelmed and didn't know what to do.

Now let me give a brief about the story in question. It is a story about a guy who's girlfriend suddenly dissapeard and 5 years later he found out that she had ran off with his brother to Canada and had started a family and his own family( parents, relative's) knew about it and kept it a secret. I know a bizarre plot but the story has a lot of problems such as it has very little relationship dynamics, it has a lot of details missing line the OP never mentioned the comments because if it was a real post people would have asked a lot of questions and the story ends on a weird note which just creates a lot of questions. I don't know why I became obsessed with it because I've red worser stories than this but somehow I became.

Anyways I came to this sub asking for help and will appreciate any help that anybody provide. And also can anybody please help me confirm me that the story titled ""My Girlfriend Disappeared right before my Proposal And 5 Years Later I Find Out She Ran of with my brother"" to see if it's real or not and if it was ever on Reddit? It will help me out a lot. Apparently it was on aita. Sorry to make this so long I've going though this for a while now and just want help.

How do I make time for myself while grieving?,1,0.67,2024-06-11 15:14:48,"This feels unusually asking stuff like this because, I have not experienced any deaths in few years, but in last 3 months, I had experienced 3 deaths of some people dear to me.

On march 20th I lost very dear cat of mine, his name was Brownie, Brownie was supposed to turn 1 year on April 23rd with his brother Darkie and his 2 other litter sisters Haze and Maze (kittens from different mother). 

I was having hard time because he was a cat I really chose for myself(btw all of my cats were born into our family and not adopted) because I felt deep connection with him like I did w my other 2 cats(that passed away 3 years ago) and I felt finally ready, we were having amazing time but one evening he was run over because he left our yard (we live in rural area so most of us have out-door pets)

On April 15th my grandma passed away, late night, my mom was talking to her 40 mins before she passed away. She died of heart attack in my grandpa's arms. It was really sudden because she was known as healthy one, she never went to doctor because she always found herself a home remedy for any type of sickness (that would actually work) however, she died due to having water in her lungs. A month before she said her back was hurting but she was getting better, 2 days before she passed away she even sang with my grandpa, as she always said ""Sing so loud to forget any type of pain"". Unfortunately one evil doesn't come alone. So when we went to the house late at night trying to get her changed, call funeral services etc. My aunt said that we should prepare chairs for the coffin so my grandpa said he'd be getting it since it's downstairs. But my mom told him she will get it because because my grandpa is diabetic and his pressure was super high. When she was going downstairs lights went off and she fell down. Breaking her heel bone. It's been 7-8 weeks and she still can't move properly. She used to be super active in house but now all she does is lay, watch tv. She has became super pesimistic and depressive, she mentions death every single minute and she lost will to live. She is smoker so the amount of cigarettes she is smoking is scaring me.

This is my dream job I've been talking about for years. And I called out in the parking lot 5 minutes before the shift. I literally want this job yet I still called out.

And if I think about me messing up something at work it makes it worse .....I don't want to be embarrassed calling out.

The job I have can lead to another job that makes 100k so there's no shortage of inspiration. If I don't show up tomorrow and make this work I don't understand because I will not be having a chance for that type ofjob.

People said I should get a new provider, so I have an appointment with one tomorrow. I am using some of my rent money to pay for it. This is after having two panic attacks, the second one way scary, on top of struggling to care for myself. 

I am so anxious now I throw up anything I try to eat. I can't shower because of my anxiety (and I need to clean out my shower) and overall am struggling to function. 

I'm stressing about it a little because I don't know what I am going to do about rent, but my OCD support group told me I was making the right decision. I'm also stressing because I know when I ask my mom to pick up my meds and bring them to me shes going to complain bc she's already been out here this week to bring me groceries (I can't drive, nor do I have a car). A friend also helped me out by ordering me bath wipes, shampoo caps and a few other items so I could at least get clean without having to get in the shower. I also ordered kid scissors  (too scared to order grown up scissors) to cut my own hair. Its so dirty and matted, I look like a filthy troll doll. Or like filthy Vegeta. I've cut my own hair before but I am worried about how short I want to cut it. Never done a pixie cut on myself but I figure its hair, it will grow back. But the items won't be here until Thursday.

The point is that my mom will have to come out here 3 times (because all my amazon packages go to her address, bc we can't receive mail where I live) OR I will have to wait until at least Friday for meds and items. I'm not sure which option, because I don't feel like I can wait until Friday but I don't want to inconvenience my mom. 

I want to try the Geodon (the med my old psych yelled at me to forget) again because when it was working I cleaned my entire place, was holding down a steady job, wasn't having anxiety as much, wasn't depressed and was a functioning person. Then it suddenly stopped working and I ended up in a behavioral health hospital after a manic episode that kerplunked me into a HORRID depressive episode. There they switched me off Geodon bc they didn't wanna deal with the fact you have to eat 200 calories each time you take it (I took it 3 times a day, which was admittedly hard bc I have an ED and only eat once a day normally but I worked hard to keep up with it). BUT NO OTHER MEDICATION HAS WORKED THAT WELL. I would cut off my limbs just to feel that good mentally again.

I also want back on propanolol for my heart rate. 

I'm hoping this psych will listen to what I have to say and we can work together to make a treatment plan for me.

My wife and I have been struggling for a while and now we’ve decided to see a marriage counselor. The therapist has been great, honestly. He asked me a question I haven’t been asked without strings being attached in a long time, “How do you feel?”. 

It took me a few seconds to answer because I really wasn’t sure. I finally said, “I don’t really feel anything.” He asked if that was towards my wife and I said towards everything. I don’t care about any relationship I have. I don’t care if I see anyone, speak to anyone, etc. 

I feel so much anger over the smallest things sometimes. To the point where I bite my teeth to hold it in and it feels like they’re going to break. I’ve lost all interest in old hobbies and don’t care to pick any up. 

My therapist asked if I’ve ever been through anything traumatic in my life and I told him about my careers. His eyes got wide and said, “That makes sense”. He said I’m showing signs of PTSD (not diagnosing me, just saying he sees signs of it), which was news to my wife and I.

Any advice dealing with health condition based frustration?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 11:29:14,"Hi,
Im a 25yo M, ive had issues with ankle, knees, and muscular tension as long as i can remember.

Im actually having xrays (again....) soon. This time i do think i actually know what the issue is. Howver the frustration at knowing, and knowing theres nothing i can do but wait around, is driving me crazy.

Im in a bad spell atm. The more physical activity i do, the more crippled i become. Today, i had to crawl down the stairs, lean on every wall, and when i got outside i couldnt go into my outhouse, i had to just flop onto the grass. Then 1 minute later it started raining. So i just had to lie there frustrated as fuck, unable to move, in shorts, getting soaked. All this just to have a joint to reduce the constant mild background pain but mainly to get any kind of comfort. Being uncomfortable and irritable (adhd and sitting still....) is downright depressing me.

Another New Job?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 10:26:22,"Again???

I'm not sure I have the strength to even look for a new job, but things keep adding up that make me wonder if I should start looking.

I've been there since March 1st and have not been well received. There was a married man that I was told harasses the women, and he came in, and I waited on him, and then he called back at the credit union to flirt with another woman. This triggered me, and I got very upset about this, and people became upset with me, saying there isn't much they can do. 

Also, no one will give me their cell phone numbers in case I'm running late. They each have one another's phone numbers, and I only have my bosses. 

Today when I went in one girl said you look terrible and I said I was sick. She ran upstairs to tell her mother who is also the CEO who called me and said I better go home before I get everyone else sick to which I said I need the hours I don't have sick time. When I started, 2 women were so sick for weeks. Coughing and sneezing. Blowing their nose. How come they could work while sick?

She said I could come in 2 hours early on Friday. 

Then I began researching, and there's a new law called New York State Paid sick time its mandatory for employers. For every 30 hours worked, one sick hour is accumulated.I texted this to my boss, and she said she'll look into it. 

We are merging with a new Credit Union on July 1st, and I also asked if I can go full-time since this new credit union is looking for a full-time teller.

I was told we will revisit the subject in July. (also our pay will be held the first 16 work days of July due to payroll changes and bi-weekly pay)

For me, it's just kind of adding up and making me feel as if I need to look for a new job.

However, I want to make a smart move and educated move, and I don't want to have to switch jobs as I am 56 this year.

Is this just a normal work environment? Does everyone put up with some sort of crap at their job? 

Maybe I should just stick it out...

How would I know when to leave? I don't want to act too hastily.

Or maybe my MI is causing my perspective to be askew. Maybe I'm over sensitive 

I have had a ridiculous amount of jobs and usually find myself having trouble navigating these types situations, then I quit.

Need help coping with death anxiety. Desperately.,2,0.76,2024-06-11 06:39:54,"I need help coping with death. Desperately. 

I (23M) have been struggling with death anxiety for weeks. I know I’m not old or anywhere near a natural death, but the fear has taken over my life. I just want help.

It began due to stresses in my life and some family passing last year in both mine and my girlfriend’s life. I was raised a Roman Catholic but I feel that my scientific education and life experiences has taught me to value verifiable evidence based knowledge. Now the fear of an eternal and absolute non existence consumes me. The fear of a slow death stealing my body and brain control from me until I could no longer said to be alive is a close second.

Since this crisis has begun, I no longer view my life the same. It’s like I’m acting out the person I used to be, but under the surface I’ve lost passion and love for things that gave me joy. 
I used to exercise 6 times a week and maintain rigorous nutrition regimes, but I can’t bring myself to do it anymore.

My loved ones support me and offer me comfort, but all I can see when I look at them is how much time they have left on this world and how they will feel as they pass. My girlfriend cherishes me and tells me it’ll be ok, and I try to focus on the life I want together, but all I can picture when I look at her is the thought of saying goodbye to her.

I’ve even had intrusive thoughts of suicide. I rationalise that my fear is a symptom of being a living biological human, but that fear evolves into the idea that since my fear of death is a human construct I might as well experience it now to relieve my fear and pain. The fear pulls me back to clarity.

I’ve been trying to cope. I learn and research about death, from the viewpoint of the sciences and theories/evidence of after life. It all makes me more afraid. Naturalism, Theism, Dualism, Reincarnation. I’ve spoken to priests, friends, family, even my coworkers. I’ve gone to therapy and it hardly helps. I’ve pondered over every argument for how final death wouldn’t be so bad, but none of it gives me comfort. I’ve even considered hypnotic past life regression therapy to see something to put me at ease.

I appreciate any answers and help I can get. Thank you ,1,1.0,2024-06-11 10:01:11,"
To this day, I feel like I can’t say I was abused because I wasn’t beaten up or battered. I feel like I’m blowing things out of proportion 

My stepdad used to slap me hard around the face when I did something wrong, the one time I remember is when I was about I accidentally took the car keys to the skatepark with me and then I got home and he slapped me in front of my friend.

One time my mum asked me to do something and I replied something which was rude - I can’t remember what it was but it wasn’t insulting or anything - then my stepdad stormed upstairs and strangled me against the wall with my legs raised off the ground in front of a different friend.

He also used to sit me down with the door closed and shout at me for about 30 minutes whenever I did something wrong. (Missing bus home for example). What’s stupid about this is I don’t remember a word he said but just how it made me feel.

I told my biological dad about this at some point and it got back to my stepdad. Or I might of confronted them when I was a teenager. I can’t remember. And then it became real - part of the family narrative and my stepdad had to face it.

So now, from time to time, he will joke about how he’s going to hit me if I do something wrong. In a way that implies that it never happened.

I think this gaslighting is what has lead me to think that it’s not a big deal.

Is it a big deal?

Does anyone else experience this?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 09:54:24,"I've been diagnosed with a few different disorders, which include BPD, OCD, MDD, GAD, and SPD. This is just for context. I need to know if anyone else has experienced this specific situation below.

I am in general disgusted with bodily fluids. Thinking about my own or other people's makes me gag, makes me angry, or literally recoil. I am grossed out by people's existence and the flesh suits we are forced to inhabit. I thought this might be because of contamination OCD or the SPD. I am also very fearful of being touched. 

I struggle with impulse control and that includes with sex. I crave the external validation and have no care in regards to how many people or who it is. I think about it daily and it's overwhelming. I need other people there. I don't like to be alone. 

It feels like there's 2 different people in my head fighting for control over my body. The one ""person"" wants to sleep with everybody and it's hard to think when that one is leading. BUT the other ""person"" who is disgusted with it all instills fear by focusing on the possibility of STDs or negative repercussions of those choices. I imagine the second person with a clipboard giving the first one a lecture. 

I want to also include that when I make a genuine connection with someone, that the disgust for bodily fluids disappears completely. The ones I have for my own body don't, but I find myself WANTING theirs. I don't understand this 180 degree shift. Also as soon as I lose trust for someone, I'm right back to feeling disgusted again.

Usually the second ""person"" wins because the fear is stronger than the desire to sleep with people. It's the only thing that's kept my life semi-functional. I've only had 2 sexual partners in my life and honestly that's amazing considering my circumstances. But it still leaves me feeling out of control and like my head is spinning. It's not like I come out of it satisfied that I've come to some sort of ""good"" conclusion to not have sex in an unsafe way. I usually feel stuck in limbo like I'm unable to act. I feel tired. My head continues to spin and I end up laying in bed. 

It bothers me that it feels like I'm a 3rd wheel to these occurrences. How do I go from being grossed out by people to craving it?

Can't be myself,3,1.0,2024-06-11 03:54:37,"People have historically always said ""Just be yourself and people will like you."" ""Just be yourself and you'll make friends."" But this factually isn't true, and I'm living proof of this. It's been taking a toll on my mental health. I feel completely alienated from other people in general, I feel like I can't keep a single friend or have any meaningful friendship, and I just feel alone.

Every time I meet someone and just 'be myself' it always takes a turn for the worst. I'm too negative, people don't seem to like what I have to say, and the relationship always becomes toxic and crashes. I've tried being fake around people, never giving opinions, acting collected and keeping myself together, being shy and quiet, but then I can never tell anyone anything and the relationship stays shallow, then eventually ends. I can't be fake because being fake results in no real friendships, but I can't be real because I'm just genuinely a horrible person that people hate more and more as they get to know me.

I could try to 'work on myself', but then that'd inadvertently be proving that 'being yourself and you'll get friends' is a complete lie. I don't want to have to change every faucet of my being just to fit in with humanity, because I am who I am. If I have to change to fit in at all, then that just means I'm not welcome here. There really is no winning no matter how I think of it, and it's all extremely upsetting. Sometimes I think I should just give up on friendships and be some cringy 'lone-wolf' type that doesn't need anyone, but I already know that's physically impossible because I'm a human being that needs social interaction.

Overall, I dunno. I dunno what type of replies I'm expecting from this either. I'm pretty positive nothing anyone says will help, and saying ""It's OK, everything will be alright, we all feel this way sometimes."" is just a generic non-helpful answer that'll only piss me off more.

Mom’s strange behavior,1,1.0,2024-06-11 09:26:02,"Hello, my mom (mid 40s) has been through alot since she was a child, had to raise her siblings as my grandma worked and grandpa broke his back being an alcoholic. She bore responsibility of her house and then had even more traumatic experiences. I think she might be bipolar but she refuses to get help. But this is besides my point for today.

She recently has been talking for the sake of talking, without knowing what she says at times or realizing it. Yesterday , she was talking like she’s a kid.

I never had anything against them I’m not racist but I’m fucking Mexican, I know I’m not ugly I’ve been compared to Kali Uchis, and Kim Kardashian which are very beautiful women. I could never be like a white girl tho. One day I told him I didn’t think I was his type bc all he did was get with white girls behind my back and he told me I was and that he did like me. Next day he goes on snapchat and I had the urge to tell him to look someone up to make sure he didn’t have them added, on snapchat it shows the history of who’ve you searched and you can basically tell what they look like because of the bitmojis. The history was literally all white girls like a row of just 8 white girls.

Idk now when I see a white girl online I just think about how my ex would probably think they’re so pretty. It’s been a year and a half since I’ve even been with him and it still crosses my mind every time I see a white girl. At this point it’s driving me insane. 

(I forgot to add that one of the girls had actually interviewed me a couple months back for a job I really wanted that I had no idea she was at. Of course she didn’t give me the job all because of this man. She pretended to lose my job application and that honestly set me off even more with insecurity which is why I also couldn’t stop thinking about it.)

Needing advice on doctor push back,1,1.0,2024-06-11 08:24:38,"Things have been rough lately.. Just about every aspect of my life has been pressed and it's becoming difficult to even think straight. My daughter has had health issues, shes had issues at school, where a substitute teacher was investigated due to aggressiveness in the classroom and with my daughter and students (she was in Kindergarten btw) which has had my wife and I on edge, weve had financial issues, and ive had health issues ranging from back problems to having CT scans over pain I've been having in my lower abdomen. All the stress has caused me having difficult sleeping, and depression. And that's just from problems I've felt comfortable sharing lol..



I requested some time off from work. 3 weeks to be exact. And btw I requested NON PAID time off. I don't care about the money I'll be losing. I just need time to get myself and my family together. 



The problem is, my employer does ask for medical documentation because this is considered a mental health issue. And the issue is when I asked something similar a few years back, my doctor had a bit of push back, stating I'd have to go to therapy to get that sort if documentation. I tried meds a few years ago and didn't like it as well, so the last thing I want to do is just take pills for depression and sleep. 



I've talked to some friends and family about this and many of them have stated that if my doctor brushes it off again, I need to find another doctor. Because they said it shouldn't be this difficult getting documentation from a doctor stating they are supporting this time off. ESPECIALLY when im not hunting for money or disability. It's just so I don't lose my job.



Now if I take this time off and I'm still in a rough spot, then yea  im open to seeing what other options there are. But for now, I just need to take care of some issues and most of all, spend time with my family. 



What do you guys think? If my doctor continues the push back or flat out refuse the support, should I seek better support from another doctor?

I had a weed-induced psychosis last night. Why did I go through that TERRIFYING experience?,3,0.71,2024-06-14 14:56:59,"I have never tried any cannabis in my life. Rarely drink. No history of mental illness as I know it. But I had 1-3mg of a weed rope gummie last night in the presence of friends -- a tiny piece! -- and two hours in, after a weird kind of relaxing high and slight headache, I started to lose my mind.

I stumbled to the bathroom in a daze. Came back and absolutely nothing felt real. I felt like I was both asleep and awake, alive and dead, stuck in my body. I was extremely paranoid if this current moment was real and I was panicking if this feeling would ever stop.

I remember asking my friends incessant questions and them calming me down. Taking a cold shower. Throwing up, asking them to take me to the ER. Being in the hospital and sleeping it off.

I cannot explain to you the dread, panic, terror, and paranoia I felt. I never, ever want to experience that again, and just remembering the moment makes my stomach churn and take me back to that place.

WTF did that happen? The one thing I am so incredibly, deeply grateful for is that it happened with my friends, who I trust. The thing that grounded me over and over is that my friends are kind, they wouldn't fool me, I trust their judgement, this is reality. But it's like remembering that love was my last tether to reality.

"I did something stupid and I could use ""there there"" ",4,0.84,2024-06-14 09:48:43,"I'll keep this short. I have the diagnoses of cPTSD, autism and chronic depression. I've battled with alcohol/weed addiction all my adult life because my brain wouldn't shut up. Nowadays I have good medication to help with that. But this week I did something stupid.

My doctor has just changed my dosage of bupropion/wellbutrin from 150mg to 300mg. That has been going amazingly well. I was doing so well that I thought it's okay if I smoke a little bit of weed on Sunday night. But then, old habits, I kept smoking all day until Monday night when I realized that this is a bad decision. Tuesday was spent in physical exhaustion from weed withdrawal. Wednesday I had a date. Since I was feeling okay, I shared a bottle of wine with my date. The date went really badly actually. So I was spiraling at night, which is when I took a diazepam to calm down... while tipsy from the wine and while also recently on bupropion 300mg, yes. And the next morning, Thursday, I wake up in a heavy depression, way more than the failed date would call for. I forced myself to go out with a friend and have two more heavy drinks to calm myself down, and then I'm still in a bad mood. Late at night I realized that my medications already had a warning for alcohol use and being used together should be with caution, not while tipsy, and having used weed in the same week (which gives me mood swings)... So I basically induced a heavy and sharp depression on myself.

I know I fucked up. I'm feeling a bit better today (Friday) and decided to not have even a little bit of light beer for a couple of weeks to stabilize again. Can anyone relate to making such mistakes? Could I get a digital hug? 

Please don't judge me too harshly if you are the judgmental type. This weakness is part of my disorders and my autism doesn't help with remembering crucial health details or interoception.

A predator relative ruined the way I see things and I have no clue what to do.,7,0.9,2024-06-14 06:18:15,"I posted this a while ago and it got absolutely 0 replies or advice. So I simply tried forgetting. Recently though, something reminded me of this, and I'm starting all the progress of forgetting over from the start again. Also, for context, I'm a dude, which may be important but may not be? I don't really know.

So i'm not really going to elaborate, but let's just say my cousin did some very bad shit to my sister. I never knew anything happened or was happening, and the whole time we were just totally fine. I never even knew. Until I knew. The man is a monster.  

Fast forward to after all this was revealed to me, a ton of stuff is totally tainted now and it's making me super sad. I used to love rebuilding computers, but ever since I found out about what he did and that he did that too, it just reminds me of him. I used to love playing multi-player games with him since he was good at only some of them and I was good at most of them so I'd usually beat him (I admit I did take advantage of that). 

A few days ago (a few MONTHS ago, this is old but applies) I was playing an online game and thought about the times i played it with him, and then thought about what he did, and then remembered that he made me sit on his lap while playing and that train of thoughts was so disturbing I literally froze while playing the game while online. It must have been 5 minutes or so of me just sitting there listening to Team Fortress noises blasting in the background having some sort of terrible mental event until I finally sort of ""snapped back"" and just shut the computer off and went to bed. I havent opened it since out of fear of being reminded of him. I feel bad for my teammates, because I'm sure I probably made them lose.  

Even my college planning is getting screwed up. My current choice of college is a community College, and since I'm kinda dumb and also kinda poor, it's the only option I have. Fine school, but it reminds me of him. I'm genuinely not sure how to handle possible taking classes in a school he went to. I even remember visiting him once. I'm considering crossing it off my list. (Even months later this is still true, but sadly it's like the only college I can get in in range of me that isn't either extremely suspicious, online, or a trade school.)

Hell, now that it's been a few months since I wrote some of this I notice that even my *laugh* sometimes reminds me of him. Now I want to reprogram my throat so I can stop thinking of that vile monster when I start laughing. Thank God me and the rest of my family have a restraining order on him, but he's *STILL* fucking with me.

"Just dropped partner off at ER, they won't have a place to return to",28,0.95,2024-06-14 03:12:47,"I met Gabby (Fake name for always obvious reasons) about 4 months ago. They were in a very bad space, they said their Uncle was watching them with cameras and talking bad about them all the time late into the night. I believed this entirely, until they moved with me and my mom and dad. Then they started saying the same things about us, accusing me of cheating on them and saying my parents are watching them with cameras and calling them a variety of negative names. The accussations are so bizarre and plentiful, I can't even explain them all. It has been painful for 4 days, with me getting no sleep before work because I'm up all night trying to explain the truth and looking up ways to handle the delicate situation healthily. I got Gabby's sisters number and talked with her about what to do, and talked to my chemical dependency treatment leader (not sure of their title, they lead these groups I must attend because of my DUI's) , and looked up what I could online and it all led to the same answer: Get them help at the Emergency Room.

My parents said they don't feel safe, and are afraid of getting in trouble for these accusations and they are already stressed out as my mom just found out she has cancer, and my dad is struggling to find a job. They wiill not allow Gabby back after they are discharged.

I don't even know if Gabby will be discharged. I don't know how any of this works. All I know is that Gabby was experience purely auditorial hallucinations, but they were extremely bad, and led Gabby to thoughts of self harm.

About one hour ago I dropped them off, then cried in my car until I got home just to type this out. I was so happy for four months, and the demons Gabby are fighting and the horror that is mental illness stripped away the best friend I had. I feel alone, lost, and am focusing my strength on trying to explore the options for Gabby to be healthier. My job is stressful, I'm going through treatment for my second DUI, and I have no idea what to do. I am not asking for medical advice, that is why they're at the ER.

Do I talk to the social worker they are talking with right now after intake?

Where will Gabby go after being discharged? They have 0 family. They only have their aunt and uncle, which Gabby cut ties with by accusing them of horrible things and leaving with me to my familys. I can't support living with Gabby outside of my familys home, and they need my rent money as well.

If anyone knows any resources to go to, please, I have never wanted help like this before.

edit: Gabby is self aware and came willingly to the E.R. They know they were hearing things, but they would have some episodes where it wouldn't stop and they wouldn't accept the reality certain things weren't being said. We have been at the beach and Gabby says they can hear my parents talking bad on her, or threatening her. I know they were just at work.

  
Edit 2: Please understand, I absolutely love this person. They healed me by being them. Besides the mental episodes causing some grief and worry, Gabby is the most mature and understanding person I know. They came willingly to the E.R, consciously knowing they needed help. They understand my parents don't feel comfortable having them back. Everyone thinks they will be in there for awhile. The only true problem I'm trying to solve is where will they go once they are let out. They have 0 family, I am trying to find some government resource for housing for them.

I truly envy others who seemingly know what they're doing and wasting no time, thinking about useless stuff like what I'm doing to work towards their goals.

I turned to social media hoping to find a sense of acceptance and belonging, thinking it would provide a great opportunity to socialize.

I just. Can’t. Do. It. I know I’m being childish and stupid and let things get to me too easily. Obviously, almost no one likes their job. But, I don’t know how they then have the ability to know they have to get up, day after day, and go do something they can’t look forward to.

People on the internet need to understand this one thing,3,0.72,2024-06-13 04:31:02,"You can hop on reddit, get on a burner account, and wreak absolute havoc with zero repercussions. 

You can respond to someone’s post about how they want to off themself and decide to tell them they’re a horrible human being for putting other people through that. 

You can judge someone for using Reddit or the internet as a source of help. 

You can make the conscious decision to bully someone who is at rock bottom. 

It’s so incredibly easy being mean to people you don’t know. You’ll never learn their name, you’ll never see them in person. You’ll never feel the guilt or see their face when they read your disgusting message. 

Like I said, there’s zero repercussions. 

I’ll still never be able to understand why people do it. Why trolls are a thing. Why people find gratification in doing these things. 

We learn to ignore the “internet trolls,” or we hear “don’t let them get to you,” as a response. But we continue to allow it to happen. It’s almost expected of you to just brush off rude comments and you’re weak if you let them get to you. Why is that? How come they don’t put algorithms in play to stop trolling from happening? Bullying on the internet has caused a lot of issues. 

It’s one of the most disgusting things on the planet in my opinion. 

Personally, I’ve reached out for help. Several times. Been at rock bottom, several times. Wanted to off myself, several. times. And every time, I’d get rude comments that just made me want to do it even more. 

One rude comment almost trumps 5 nice ones. And they know that.

I don't remember exactly when it started but the first time I really noticed this.. tick? Was when it started as a head jerk. 

I will be minding my own business and then my brain will decide to bring up a memory of something I did that I feel shame, embarrassment, or guilt about. I am a very visual person, I get lost in my daydreams often they are so vivid. So when I remember something, sometimes it's so vivid that I'm actually relieving the event. And then my head would jerk and I would wince, as if I was trying to literally shake it off. This went on from at least age 20-28, 34 now. It went away for a short period where I was really distracted and feeling okay about myself but then it came back sometime during COVID and it started involving me verbally saying ""Shhhh"" and then it becomes ""shut up!!"" And recently ""you f***ing idiot"" and it's something that it's hard to hide now. It happens all day sometimes. My partner doesn't say much about it but I can tell she's distressed or thinks I'm maybe crazy and I think I'm maybe crazy too.

Mild Depression (probably),1,1.0,2024-06-11 06:07:54,"TW// SMALL MENTION OF DISORDERED EATING

Hey y'all, F17 here, 

for the last 5 yrs of high school, life has been up and down. Or more like, my home life is fantastic (great parents, travels a lot, comfortably living, steady job, etc etc) but school has just been awful for me. shitty people going behind my back, not a ton of real good friends, I was overweight for the first half of high school and that took a toll on my mental health as well. I've felt very ""Meg Griffin-ish."" not an outcast like her, people talk to me — I just have NEVER really been anyone's favourite/first choice, and it has gotten me down. Recently, the thing that has had me REALLY down is my recent breakup.

Because of it, something has changed. I feel like an off switch (?) has been flipped in my mind. Im not suicidal, more like empty, and Im constantly living in the past, and daydreaming about a better school experience/friends. I deleted all of my social medias and unfollowed a bunch of people, I wanna throw away my phone completely and the thought of seeing people I know in my area makes me sick. I literally just want to ""disappear"" and restart my life when I go to university in September, with a clean slate. 

Sometimes after having fun with my only 2 real friends, I'll get home and get overwhelmed with emptiness, then cry. I dont know why, because I genuinely have the time of my life then go home and crash. I struggle with body image still and although I don't s/h, I do starve myself. I sleep normally but lately ive been having disturbing dreams about my ex and I can never seem to get my mind off of the fact that I had so much fun in elementary school, before everyone did me wrong. Im sick of people effing me over and treating me badly.

  
I am not diagnosed (AND NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS) but low-key I might ask for therapy. I feel like I have MILD depression at least, or depressive symptoms, because sometimes I cant even function, I sit in my room for hours and fall into a deep dark hole of thoughts and Im sick of it. Im sick of ruining my own fun, especially when other aspects of my life are so good. I wanna go one day without letting the thoughts consume me. Im tired of remembering how badly Ive been treated.

"My religious parents found out I was transfem and are trying to ""set me on the right path"". Feels like my life is over now. ",1,1.0,2024-06-11 03:14:21,"I posted something similar on some trans subs, but posting here to include more details.

Here's the situation: Yesterday, my parents found out that I changed my name and wanted to become a girl. They sat down with me and launched into a huge lecture about how LGBTQ+ people are all delusional, that I only think this because I have ""too much time to think"", that being LGBTQ+ was going to lead me down a path that ends with drug abuse and AIDS, and that all of my current problems and anxiety were because I strayed from religion. Not only are they forcing me to act like a boy and become religious, they are also not allowing me to pursue my major of choice at a college that I have already applied for (I was in their honors program too) because they are ""worried about the friends I'll make"".

I tried to overdose on Advil because of this (I only had a mild stomachache to show for it). I feel like the parts of me that could feel joy were ground to dust, that the very things that kept me going had disappeared completely. I feel like my parents have no concern for the real me, just their idealized version of a son that they always wanted. And they frame it as a form of caring that is exclusive to unbreakable love of parents, something that they claim I'll never understand until I'm 25. I feel like seriously killing myself, something I hadn't felt for years, and that I am only going to become a bigger threat to myself as time goes on.

I have no idea if my parents are emotionally abusive (serious accusations there), but I know that I want to escape from them. Their line of thinking has caused so much pain, and up until now I was willing to excuse them for it (caregivers are like that, I assumed). Now, I just want to be free of them.",mentalhealth,Clolossal,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dd4b4s/my_religious_parents_found_out_i_was_transfem_and/,0,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06

It has a lot of inconsistencys and plot holes and the premise itself is bizarre. But the problem was that I became obsessed with it. To the point I sort manifested myself as the main character. I started to feel their emotions which were heartbreak, pain, anxiety, betrayal etc. all of these emotions are overwhelming me and I'm sick of it. I wake up in the morning sad and I often get triggers. I picture some of the characters in people around me. And it makes things worse. Even in the last few weeks I was able to thin it down and get over it a bit but my mind keeps relapsing and in the last couple of days it has become hard. I came here because I was very overwhelmed and didn't know what to do.

Now let me give a brief about the story in question. It is a story about a guy who's girlfriend suddenly dissapeard and 5 years later he found out that she had ran off with his brother to Canada and had started a family and his own family( parents, relative's) knew about it and kept it a secret. I know a bizarre plot but the story has a lot of problems such as it has very little relationship dynamics, it has a lot of details missing line the OP never mentioned the comments because if it was a real post people would have asked a lot of questions and the story ends on a weird note which just creates a lot of questions. I don't know why I became obsessed with it because I've red worser stories than this but somehow I became.

Anyways I came to this sub asking for help and will appreciate any help that anybody provide. And also can anybody please help me confirm me that the story titled ""My Girlfriend Disappeared right before my Proposal And 5 Years Later I Find Out She Ran of with my brother"" to see if it's real or not and if it was ever on Reddit? It will help me out a lot. Apparently it was on aita.

"have been lying to my psychiatrist about my real issues because i’m scared, what do i do?",1,1.0,2024-06-10 20:48:06,"I’m nervous about posting this because truly at this point I have nobody to talk to regarding this that I think may understand? So..I will try to explain everything to the best to my ability. I [18F] have been diagnosed with AD(H)D, an unspecified anxiety disorder & depression, BUT this is only because my parents just wanted me to get a 504 help plan in school because I can’t focus, so that’s why they got the psychiatrist in the first place. 

But this is where it started getting worse, I know I have more issues than this, but i’m horrified to get help. Before I started seeing this psychiatrist, she met with my parents and they filled out a form with characteristics I met, and I asked my sister about it when they showed it to her and she had told me that they had lied on portions of it relating to more problems because they only wanted an ADHD diagnosis (such as possibly having autism, suicidal ideation, blah blah blah)

Our meetings have been normal because my psychiatrist just wants me to finish school which is why I’m seeing her, but I want to tell her my real issues like the things that have been going on at home. My mom is a huge alcoholic and drug addict, and it gets really bad on a nightly basis; she screams and screams and nobody does anything and we can’t get her help even though we’ve tried. She has constantly abused me emotionally and mentally, mostly due to the fact I’m behind in credits for school, I don’t have my license yet (working on it now that it’s summer) and the fact I have a girlfriend. My sister recently cut me off too because of my moms actions, so I can’t talk to her about all these things. I do have really bad issues with self-harming to cope with these things in my life or I punish myself to go without sleep. 

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist later today, but I’m so scared of telling her about these things, specifically the self-harming & asking for pills that work? Because she has prescribed me anxiety pills that are only meant to be used in emergency situations, but I’ve gone through them because it’s everyday that I have panic attacks at this point and I truly don’t know if I’m even capable of being helped as I have been deemed as a failure by everyone in my life. I feel so horrible and guilty that I’ve lied to her about everything being fine when it’s not, I don’t want her to think i’m crazy or even send me to an inpatient facility because my mom has convinced me that’s what’s gonna happen and that my issues aren’t as bad as hers. 

I plan to tell her today but I know i will break down so very bad in her office, i’m scared that i will look like an attention seeker, but I hate feeling the way I have been every single day. Moving out isn’t an option, living with anyone else isn’t either, I’ve talked to my dad about my moms issues but he doesn’t understand her and lets her get away with all of this stuff because she is very disabled.

Grounding? Struggling to keep going.,1,1.0,2024-06-10 20:37:51,"Hello all,

I suffer from general anxiety and clinical depression (have been on medication for 32 years) and am going through a really bad depressive and anxiety episode at present. This is not my first episode.

I have access to a psychologist via work and she has advised to use grounding techniques when the bad / intrusive / suicidal thoughts occur.

However, I'm struggling to find one which works. 
I've tried the 3-3-3 and 5-4-3-2-1 techniques but I am still thinking the other thoughts while doing these.
I only find it takes me a few seconds to complete these and then the bad thoughts continue.

She suggested touching something physical e.g wedding ring but doesn't help either.

I've tried mindfulness but I cannot find 'now' 

Whether I am doing something wrong or I am utterly useless (more likely the case)

Today started as being very  anxious without being able to feel why. I've been going downhill to rock bottom since.

I thought I was doing better as I had 3 consecutive days without suicidal thoughts.

My psychologist wants to try EMDR but I can't  remember any trauma and have no reason to believe there is any. I have no reason to believe that my childhood wasn't generally happy. Therefore would EMDR work.

I have tried CBT several times but it never seems to work for me. I am a generally logical but the same logic that I would apply to others doesn't apply to me. I feel I am not worthy of it and am worthless, useless and a waste of space.

At present I feel too broken to be fixed this time.

I come from a middle class immigrant family, we are not well off and I am an international here in Australia so you can say the fees are a lot. I work most of the days and study when I am free but I cannot focus. I am struggling to pass the units and it’s hard for me to think about the fees that I will have to pay to do the units again and that my study year is going to be extended if I’m not wrong. 

And today my mom found me smoking cigarettes and the guilt is making me sick. Until now I am always feeling that guilt of failing, having no fun and buying things I love which are not necessary. I know I should be saving money which I do, I just buy things sometimes and go out sometimes with friends cause my parents are very strict and they worry about me spending too much money and also my safety. 
Idk what to do I’m not able to focus on my studies and feel like a failure everyday. I feel guilty when I go out with friends, when I eat out without my family, having fun and even being out late. This is making me hard to commit to a relationship and be open to my close ones. But today when she found me smoking I didn’t know what to say and do at that moment, now I’m feeling guilty makes my stomach sick.
I want to be better and make them proud that’s all I want to do.

I get no freedom because I am a minor they said they have hidden cameras in some rooms which makes me feel very uncomfortable. So I just am trying to not do anything to big.

Yesterday I admitted to myself that I have symptoms of depression and I believe it to be true.

I’m taking away the shame/false guilt/judgements of mental health/illness that I have had for so long and I  want to learn to live with it in a healthy way!

Illogical anxiety stemming from my job,1,1.0,2024-06-11 01:52:00,"I'm working at a research center for my summer job as an over-the-phone interviewer. The content of the research isn't pertinent to this, but it's a legitimate research effort that's been going on for some time. I haven't been there for very long, and I need some advice for confronting these fears.

Making calls is the hard part, for no good reason whatsoever. It's genuine research, the people on the other end will never know who I am, and it's fairly simple. Whenever I actually make the calls, my heart just races. I feel anxious. Anxiety apparently runs in the family, but usually I can quell mine with logic. This time, I can't. I don't know why. Be it reminding myself that I'm just doing my job, that they have no idea who I am, or that they have nothing personal against me, nothing works. It's confusing and infuriating. I can't even talk to random people over the phone without feeling a bottomless pit in my stomach.

I'm afraid to do a literally innocuous task and I don't know why. I almost feel like I've lost, reaching this far for any kind of support, because I can't just get rid of it this time.

All of my ambitions seem impossible and I'm kind of numb about my passions.,1,1.0,2024-06-11 03:00:02,"My biggest ambition above all else is to have a wife who loves and respects me for me. The woman I was with for some time showed me neither of those were ever present from her.

My next ambition was to succeed at starting a business. Even if it failed, successfully start one. Had the business registered, had distribution set up, software in place, and was set to give the manufacturer the green light to ship us the first 10 units. But, with the depression and corresponding alcoholism from the breakup I had to put a pause on things. Which is essentially the graveyard for startups.

If I couldn't be successful at business with my ideas, I could at least create them. Collecting royalties on patent work could keep me afloat and getting to create new ideas has always been my dream (only behind a loving wife who respects me). I successfully was granted a patent, of a technology my business was going to leverage.

But, in the past, I used to have passion about new ideas. I'd work on one, then move on to the next if the first proved futile. I don't like to bring it up too much, but, I have Aspergers. So, when I hyper fixated on something I was spending weeks forgetting to eat or leave the house because of some new idea. The last handful of years and especially recently I haven't gotten passionate about any project. I'll work on something and get interested in it. But, my eyes won't light up when I talk about it.

Women have told me I'm attractive and sweet and well put together, so, my last resort was to just give up and seek comfort in the hollow love I can receive by becoming a womanizer. I studied up on what they do and how they do it, spent a couple months figuring out how I personally could go about having someone to hold for the night, then set it into practice. End of story, I blew through money on drinks for months and proved to myself I am abysmal at speaking to anyone in a casual manner.

I have failed my first three ambitions and couldn't succeed at the ambition I settled for after them. My depression is running rampant in a cycle that worsens itself as the only way to silence the suicidal ideation is with alcohol, which of course makes the depression worse. The awkwardness of my Aspergers seems to be manifesting itself prolifically whilst the passionate pursuit of random subjects seems to have abandoned me completely.

i’m slowly realizing that i’m actually not okay,1,1.0,2024-06-11 03:44:30,"My anxiety has played a big role in my life for the past couple of years. I’m the type of person that would rather deal with it myself than ask someone for help because “it’ll pass or go away”. so, right before the pandemic and soon after i had actually spiraled. we had gone on a family trip and while at a hotel i had a panic attack and could not leave the hotel room. i sought out counseling and it was okay for a while.

Fast forward last year, perhaps the worst year of my life and the year that changed my life. we found out that my dad had been cheating on my mom— i was a big daddy’s girl growing up and my life changed completely after that. i never expected it to affect my anxiety but it did.

i began to worry about dumb things like what my family is thinking about us, how they perceive us, what my dad is doing now with his ‘freedom’, does he have another family now, will we eventually cut all contact with him??? will i never have an actual father figure in my life?? i assumed that they where insignificant fears that i was imagining but a few months into this year I started to notice a difference in me — and specifically in my thought process. 

i’ve begun to think a LOT about self harm… specifically things like ‘what if i offed myself right now before anyone came home?’ or ‘what if i took a little too much medication and yknow… make it or didn’t make it?’ i HATE it, never have i ever in my life EVER thought about things like that.. it terrifies me so much that i get severely anxious thinking about it.

also.. another thing that’s recently been in my mind aside from the previous topic is hurting someone else. i feel so disgusted with myself for even THINKING about hurting someone and even worse someone close to me (someone who genuinely loves me and looks after me). my anxiety has now spiraled out of fear that i might hurt myself or someone else…

For eg, once i gagged real loud cause the trash smelled bad. And that exact soundbite of my gag was just playing over and over the rest of the day.

Is this just an anxiety thing? Cause I've noticed it only happens with things said or sounds made by people in a distressing or angry way.

I'll start hearing people calling my name angrily, random yells or screams of a family member scolding someone, or crying. Or just phrases like ""Don't do that!!!"" ""Look here!!"" ""Please!!! Stop!!"" Etc etc. To stop this from happening i need to listen to a podcast, otherwise it makes me panic tf out.

I felt really good and felt like I was on track to doing what I really wanted to do in life. But anyway I went off to a small college in Missouri and less than a month into college I went through something super traumatic that my friends (term used loosely) basically set me up in and let it happen. Since then I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I have always struggled with anxiety, depression, and OCD, but ever since then everything has just gotten so, so much worse. I went from being valedictorian of my class in high school to failing a class my first semester and not being able to keep an A my entire first year of college. I know people say you shouldn't compare high school coursework to college coursework because it is harder but it really does just make me feel like I’m really setting myself up for failure. None of my family knows what happened and I have basically no friends anymore because everyone stopped talking to me after I got so depressed and the one person that i would've called my best friend (was not there when incident happened) told me that what happened was my own fault and she didn't want to deal with me anymore and ghosted me. I have two friends that I talk to pretty consistently and they genuinely have tried helping me through everything but I'm just feel like they don't get it enough to even help me and that makes me feel extremely guilty. I just feel scared because now I feel like even the two friends that have tried helping me are just getting tired of me because I'm not getting any better and I can feel them pushing away, every time I try to talk about how l'm feeling they change the subject completely so now I have no outlets except for therapy, which is good I guess but I would prefer at least one person in my personal life I could talk to. I don't want to expect that they should listen because I know it's probably hard to hear nothing but negativity from me all the time and I don't want them to feel pressured into hearing it because the last thing I would ever want to do is make them upset. I just feel so alone and like nothing is ever going to get better for me and I feel so stuck. I have no goals anymore and no one to turn to and it's just so hard and the worst feeling in the world. A lot of the time I feel like I'm being dramatic and blowing things out of proportion and I just need to move on like everyone else, but it's just so hard. Sorry I probably rambled on for so long, there's a lot more to the story but I will stop there for now.

Is this normal or should I be concerned?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 03:04:09,"Basically I had a not so great mental day, in where I cried a bunch, then I started laughing while crying, which I had never had done before, 
Later, I just wanted to take a shower, but while I was waiting for the water to heat up a bit, I started pacing and repeating stuff that came to my mind, just like ""no"", ""I'm doing better"" ""I can't"" and some that weren't related which I can't remember, so I did that for a while outside of the shower, and then I tried to get myself to stop and go into the shower, where I stopped pacing but still repeated the phrasing. Normally I wouldn't really think about it, but I had done it for like an hour in the shower (usually I only take like 15-30 minutes ), and I remember me doing a similar thing once back in 2021 when my mental health was really bad.

How do I deal with stress and anxiety while stuck at work?,1,1.0,2024-06-11 02:55:10,"I have been dealing with mental health problems for years and years now. It seems like I can't ever have anything go right for me. 
Recently, the horrible things that plague my personal life have been so draining, they carry over to when I'm working. I'm working so much slower than I used to, in a job that requires me to get a lot of stuff done in a very consistent amount of time. I don't have much time to myself anymore, but I desperately need advice on how to destress and calm down while I'm at work. 

And before you say anything. No, I cannot simply fix or solve any of the problems with my personal life. That'd require me to have a family who doesn't hate my very existence. Work is the only place I have left where I'm away from my toxic family. How do I keep myself from crying in the bathroom and wanting to cut myself at work? It has to be an easy solution. I can't just ask for an easier workload or take a day off. It doesn't work that way with this job. 

I need advice. How can I find a way to relax while doing all this heavy lifting at work? ",mentalhealth,TheCloneKiller,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dd3ydz/how_do_i_deal_with_stress_and_anxiety_while_stuck/,2,1.0,0.0,2.13329237411975e-06
"No energy, I don’t know why i feel like this ",1,1.0,2024-06-11 02:49:08,"I’m sorry if i’m spamming but I just really want someone to talk to and I have almost no one. i’ve tried to reach out to this sub several times before to no avail. I don’t know how to feel. My brother just graduated with a BA in machine learning and i saw several people who went to the same middle school as me graduate as well and here i am still doing my first year after failing a class almost every quarter. I have no energy, haven’t been to the gym in weeks, i don’t like being around people. going to class brings me extreme anxiety now so i just prefer to skip class and stay in my apartment all day every day. I don’t really know why this is the case but during daytime hours (7am to like 8pm) i feel like dying and just rotting away but after that i feel happy and like my life can change but i feel like this everyday and it’s draining. I really don’t feel like elaborating more until someone says something or comments, i’m sorry i just don’t have the energy to explain again, time after time and nothing. I honestly don’t know how much longer i can keep this up, this feeling of being off and then on later at night is driving me insane and my sleep schedule is ruined. Idk what to do anymore, nothing brings me happiness anymore. Music and my dap pen is the only thing i can escape too, everything else just feels so unreal. idk I can’t even eat anymore, i can’t eat around other people, i just lose my appetite, i starve myself so that i only eat at convenient times and i now on average eat once a day at 3pm sharp.

Help with spouse,2,1.0,2024-06-11 01:36:20,"Struggling with my partner of 35 years. He was diagnosed with delusional disorder in 2008, accused me of posting indecent photos online and all kinds of paranoia, lived in basement with headphones and drove with electrical tape covering most his lenses on glasses, eventually ending in having county services keep him for a week and prescribed him an a antipsychotic. 
Within a few months after this, our 14 yr old daughter was diagnosed with a rare tumor and passed away at 16. We have 3 other children, now 29-38 years old.

My husband is receiving disability and working for one day a week, This is his 8th job in 12 years. I have been working fulltime for the past 10 years, trying to make ends meet. 

My husband just sits on the sofa the entire day and eats non stop. We don’t have much of a relationship, we go to dinner once in awhile but that is about it.  When I talk, he barely acknowledges anything I say, does not contribute to conversations when out or at home. Will not help out with any cooking, cleaning, running errands.  Is not a partner in any sense of the word.  

I just keep thinking “is this the rest of my life?”, my doctor said he’s only gonna get worse. 
I cant handle this, I’m so disgusted, hurt, angry and I don’t know where to turn.  We don’t have much money and I’ve been doing some counseling but my copays are high and deductible is ridiculous. Anyone have any ideas on how to get through this?

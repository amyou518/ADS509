2023-05-27 01:36:58,49,I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,311,0.98,"hi everyone , about a month ago i started to think about cycling across country , two week later i left moncton nb at 1pm in the afternoon and have n't looked back , tomorrow i will cross into quebec. i think this is interesting for a few reason. 1- a i said , i am fat and out of shape. i am 44m 6 ' 5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 year. i have bad knee , bad back , apnea and i 'm type 2 diabetic. 2- mentally , i 'm broken. i suffer from really bad depression , bipolar 2 and chemicaly induced anxiety disorder. 3- i wa raised a a ward of the court , 30+ foster home , street kid , jail , addiction. been a hard road. so why on earth am i doing this? two main reason. first and foremost bc is my home province , they recently passed into law funding for school for former ward of the court regardless of age. i plan on taking full advantage of this and i think this should be the standard across all province. i have stagnated in the same industry for year and have hit a ceiling. if i ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girl i need something more. and education is where i 'll start. secondly , if i am to be successful with my schooling i need to get my head in order. because of my ciad i ca n't take antidepressant , so all my mental health issue i tackle on my own. and frankly depression is winning. i could fly out to bc and be there 12hrs from now , but i will end up being the same man. however , the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his a all the way to vancouver island , that man can do anything. he can regain control of his mental health , he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. so i want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggle and the ward of the court funding thing. it 's been over two week since i 've left and there 's been some hard dark moment , but there 's been some empowering one too. i 'm already down about 20lbs , there 's strength in my leg and back ive not felt since i wa a teenager , i 'm about to cross into a new province and i thought it wa worth sharing with this community. i have already been posting in another subreddit since i started and they 've all been so amazing. i have been posting almost daily update to my insta and tiktok but if i understand correctly i ca n't link them here on this subreddit? i also have a blog i 've been writing when i have time. both the blog and video are not a magical xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. i talk about and show both the ups and down of mental health and this monumental challenge i 've taken on. i hope there 's a few of you who might pa me on your drive , do n't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. i 'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike : ) thanks.",mentalhealth,Divest0911,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/13sum97/i_am_a_broken_man_both_mentally_and_physically_so/,68,317.3469387755102,6.346938775510182,0.0006765261985096,"['hi', 'everyone', 'month', 'ago', 'started', 'think', 'cycling', 'across', 'country', 'two', 'week', 'later', 'left', 'moncton', 'nb', 'afternoon', 'looked', 'back', 'tomorrow', 'cross', 'quebec', 'think', 'interesting', 'reason', 'said', 'fat', 'shape', 'exercised', 'meaningful', 'way', 'year', 'bad', 'knee', 'bad', 'back', 'apnea', 'type', 'diabetic', 'mentally', 'broken', 'suffer', 'really', 'bad', 'depression', 'bipolar', 'chemicaly', 'induced', 'anxiety', 'disorder', 'wa', 'raised', 'ward', 'court', 'foster', 'home', 'street', 'kid', 'jail', 'addiction', 'hard', 'road', 'earth', 'two', 'main', 'reason', 'first', 'foremost', 'bc', 'home', 'province', 'recently', 'passed', 'law', 'funding', 'school', 'former', 'ward', 'court', 'regardless', 'age', 'plan', 'taking', 'full', 'advantage', 'think', 'standard', 'across', 'province', 'stagnated', 'industry', 'year', 'hit', 'ceiling', 'ever', 'want', 'retire', 'leave', 'something', 'behind', 'girl', 'need', 'something', 'education', 'start', 'secondly', 'successful', 'schooling', 'need', 'get', 'head', 'order', 'ciad', 'ca', 'take', 'antidepressant', 'mental', 'health', 'issue', 'tackle', 'frankly', 'depression', 'winning', 'could', 'fly', 'bc', 'end', 'man', 'however', 'man', 'jump', 'bike', 'pedal', 'way', 'vancouver', 'island', 'man', 'anything', 'regain', 'control', 'mental', 'health', 'regain', 'physical', 'health', 'dedicate', 'healthy', 'body', 'mind', 'schooling', 'want', 'try', 'bring', 'awareness', 'mental', 'health', 'struggle', 'ward', 'court', 'funding', 'thing', 'two', 'week', 'since', 'left', 'hard', 'dark', 'moment', 'empowering', 'one', 'already', 'strength', 'leg', 'back', 'ive', 'felt', 'since', 'wa', 'teenager', 'cross', 'new', 'province', 'thought', 'wa', 'worth', 'sharing', 'community', 'already', 'posting', 'another', 'subreddit', 'since', 'started', 'amazing', 'posting', 'almost', 'daily', 'update', 'insta', 'tiktok', 'understand', 'correctly', 'ca', 'link', 'subreddit', 'also', 'blog', 'writing', 'time', 'blog', 'video', 'magical', 'xmas', 'land', 'type', 'upbeat', 'energetic', 'thing', 'talk', 'show', 'ups', 'mental', 'health', 'monumental', 'challenge', 'taken', 'hope', 'might', 'pa', 'drive', 'hesitate', 'giving', 'honk', 'wave', 'big', 'fat', 'guy', 'mountain', 'bike', 'thanks']","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.9746}",positive

can i touch you here? please let me `` like a fucking uneducated creep. i wa so grossed out and ca n't think properly at the moment so i chose laugh it off and got out of their room saying i 'm sleepy already and needed to rest since i still have a long travel for tomorrow. it wa so , so fucking creepy since i did n't expect my brother to be like that. in context , my 2nd older brother is just the same. he also did something like that when i wa a minor. and i wa raped when i wa in preschool. i know nothing at that age , but i remember it until now. i allowed that person to do it because i know nothing ... i really do n't know nothing. i wa so vulnerable. i wa just a child. when my parent asked why my medical result say that there wa blood in my vagina and all , i wa so nervous , scared , and got angry at them. i did n't understand it , but in my mind i wa so scared if they knew ( it 's like having sex and telling your parent you had sex at that age ). looking back , it wa so gross and i just wan na cry. i do n't want to elaborate it further about what happened afterwards. i tried to forget ... even until now. please ... please help. i 've been through a lot. not just this but thing way worse than an 18-year-old should experience. please help me😭 what should i do it felt so fucking , fucking gross like it wo n't ever fade away even if i scrub all over my body and bath again and again. i feel so dirty. i am so fucking mad right now. i wa reminded with everything. am i still supposed to understand , knowing that these guy know no shit?

2023-11-05 18:11:10,57,TW: What they don't tell you about hanging yourself,300,0.99,"a much needed premise : i miraculously survived hanging myself back in february of this year. it wa not the first time i attempted unaliving myself but it wa the first time i wa actually going to be successful if thing had n't turned out the way the did. i had done my research about this. i could not fathom doing it any other way that i thought were `` too painful and gory `` , either for me or for the person who would find me. so , after that , i wa hospitalized for a month and a half and they changed my med after 3 year and i have to say i am now in a much better mental state and ready to talk about this. if you ever thought about doing this you may have a picture in your head of how it 's going to go. i had it too and it could n't be further from the truth of what happened. so here 's the reality check : first thing first , it is not `` painless `` at all , it is not `` slowly drifting to sleep ``. your body will get so mad that you are doing this and it will react in the worst and most painful way possible. to start , you wo n't have control over your limb. i remember seeing my arm in front of me with the hand all tensed up like a zombie. it felt like my tendon were slowly getting shorter and shorter and i could n't move them. i always thought when the survival instinct would kick in the arm would go up to the rope in an attempt to lift yourself up. and it 's true that your brain will think that , but trust me , you will have no control over your movement. you want to lift the arm up overhead and they just slap around aimlessly. then you will feel like your head is going to explode and your eye are going to pop out. i felt my whole face go warmer and warmer and starting to tingle like crazy. and that 's not even the worst part : it wa the lung for me. you see , your body will get to a state of primal survival instinct where it will do anything it can to just catch a breath. but since the airway are blocked , your whole torso will tense in and out with so much force that your lung and stomach hurt like hell. think of a worm curling up when you touch it. your body will do the same over and over , in and out , each movement more and more painful than the previous one. and it 's not like you can control it. you ca n't. my whole ab and back muscle hurt a if i had fallen from 3 story for like 2 week afterwards just from the effort my body wa making by trying to get some oxygen. i wo n't even go into how it end because it 's just fucking scary. i 'll just say that there 's a point where you have the lucid thought of `` i am dying , and there 's nothing i can do about it ``. and it 's the most terrifying yet real feeling ever. it 's not `` calm and peaceful `` like you make it out to be in your mind before doing it. it 's sheer panic. and when you have this thought it 's like it last a millisecond but you 're now stuck in this state that doe n't leave you. i do n't even know why i 'm writing this , but i feel like some people need to hear this. i certainly would have had second thought had i known it in advance. i wo n't go into how i survived because i honestly still feel guilty and embarrassed about it. just know i had to be resuscitated twice and ca n't remember a thing after that panic feeling. that would have been the last feeling i ever felt. not peace , not relief. i am now convinced there 's absolutely no `` painless `` way to go and i 'm scared a hell for when it will be my time to go in the future. i still have these feeling sometimes , to end it all but i have to admit i am now an official coward. so yeah , would not recommend. it wa not worth it. just delay that feeling for a long a possible , trust

2024-04-03 14:50:17,108,Sex is disgusting sometimes- I think I might know why?,234,0.92,"i lived with my dad for a little period of time and did always go to his cottage whenever i wa off school. one thing was- he would always fuck his girlfriend/wife at the time very loudly. at some point i started getting really annoyed by it because i would storm out of the house screaming “ stop having sex when i ’ m here ”. it kept happening. i wa glad it happened in a different room but you don ’ t understand how small this cottage wa. i could hear everything and that girl would do it on purpose so i could hear it. they would do it in their room and do it in the bathroom. it echoed so much. it wa always the have loud vigorous sex , come out of the room with such confidence and going to the kitchen table to have a cigarette and a coffee. that ’ s the pattern. daily. constantly. i knew she did it on purpose because my relationship wa always terrible with the girl. she wa jealous of a young girl because my dad loved me. i wa jealous of her because i knew she didn ’ t deserve my dad and that she wa pushing him away from me. i think it got to a rotten point where i got myself off on it because i wa so used to it happening every night. i think this part is what is getting me ... i wa only 11/12-13 at the time doing all of this. it only continued from there until i moved out. there wa nothing i could do but wait on the couch and sleep there until it wa over. i didn ’ t realize how fucked up it wa to do what i wa doing. but truly -because i wa so exposed that -i thought it wa normal to do so. i think it ’ s affected me even now just because of what they did- and what i ’ ve done while that wa all happening. i feel cursed. disgusting. confused. vile. sad. desensitized. not normal. i continue to think about it til this day , and it gross me out and sometimes it will pop up in really awkward moment. i feel a rise of anger when i hear any form of moaning or sighing- i get scared or weirded or grossed out while trying to have sex. i will have flashback when having sex. i get fear from it sometimes. i hate to be touched sometimes- and it ha a lot to do with this. -i ’ ve also been through some weird instance where my dad would slap my a “ a a joke ”. who doe that all the way up til they ’ re 13? - i used to be laying on the couch and i swear to god at some point he wa watching porn around me. he wa doing it in the kitchen at the table. i know this because i heard the moaning and at the time there wa only me and him around the cottage -stumbled onto my dad only laptop and found a bunch of legging porn video .. also stumbled onto his only camera and found nude of his gf. i ’ m finding all of this at the age of 11-13 year old. -edit : my dad and the girlfriend left me alone a lot with the girlfriend son and daughter at the time. the daughter same age a me and the son 16. at the time i wa 13. we were in my dad ’ s girlfriend ’ s cottage. the son had a few drink and he started to give me a small amount of attention and sleazily asked me to be his girlfriend that night. later on he pressure me into giving him a bj and i do it because i want a boyfriend - and the morning after he break up with me. stone cold. i actually thought we were gon na be together but he actually just used me- then becomes my step brother a few year after. i think i got really lucky for being the heavier/ fat girl at the time because it would take a lot more for him to take more advantage of me than he already did. it wa my first memorable sexual experience that wa not good. he kicked me out of the room right after he couldn ’ t nut. i also have a faint memory of being around the age of 5 and playing with a younger boy and we were in a closet stripping. thankfully we got caught. i asked my mom and my sister if that ever happened because clearly the other mom probably would make a scene out of it knowing what just happened - but they both said they don ’ t recollect this at all. i think i ’ m going insane with this guilt of being so young but also pushing myself onto another person that way. it just get really fucked up. also people think this is a larp .. which is really really sad. because this legit ha happened. what am i lying about for. i smoke weed daily just to not cry- i have self harm scar from when i wa ten just from cry for any form of attention. i have physical and mental regret throughout everything i ’ ve been through. i can ’ t lie. thank you to all the kind people in the comment section : it ’ s opened my mind a lot posting this and getting a lot of wisdom from you all. the discussion is still going , i don ’ t mind- but i can ’ t promise i ’ ll be the best replier.",mentalhealth,Anxiousplaya,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1buuirg/sex_is_disgusting_sometimes_i_think_i_might_know/,72,254.3478260869565,20.347826086956506,0.0005422235000777,"['lived', 'dad', 'little', 'period', 'time', 'always', 'go', 'cottage', 'whenever', 'wa', 'school', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'always', 'fuck', 'time', 'loudly', 'point', 'started', 'getting', 'really', 'annoyed', 'would', 'storm', 'house', 'screaming', 'stop', 'sex', 'kept', 'happening', 'wa', 'glad', 'happened', 'different', 'room', 'understand', 'small', 'cottage', 'wa', 'could', 'hear', 'everything', 'girl', 'would', 'purpose', 'could', 'hear', 'would', 'room', 'bathroom', 'echoed', 'much', 'wa', 'always', 'loud', 'vigorous', 'sex', 'come', 'room', 'confidence', 'going', 'kitchen', 'table', 'cigarette', 'coffee', 'pattern', 'daily', 'constantly', 'knew', 'purpose', 'relationship', 'wa', 'always', 'terrible', 'girl', 'wa', 'jealous', 'young', 'girl', 'dad', 'loved', 'wa', 'jealous', 'knew', 'deserve', 'dad', 'wa', 'pushing', 'away', 'think', 'got', 'rotten', 'point', 'got', 'wa', 'used', 'happening', 'every', 'night', 'think', 'part', 'getting', 'wa', 'time', 'continued', 'moved', 'wa', 'nothing', 'could', 'wait', 'couch', 'sleep', 'wa', 'realize', 'fucked', 'wa', 'wa', 'truly', 'wa', 'exposed', 'thought', 'wa', 'normal', 'think', 'affected', 'even', 'done', 'wa', 'happening', 'feel', 'cursed', 'disgusting', 'confused', 'vile', 'sad', 'desensitized', 'normal', 'continue', 'think', 'til', 'day', 'gross', 'sometimes', 'pop', 'really', 'awkward', 'moment', 'feel', 'rise', 'anger', 'hear', 'form', 'moaning', 'get', 'scared', 'weirded', 'grossed', 'trying', 'sex', 'flashback', 'sex', 'get', 'fear', 'sometimes', 'hate', 'touched', 'ha', 'lot', 'also', 'weird', 'instance', 'dad', 'would', 'slap', 'joke', 'doe', 'way', 'til', 'used', 'laying', 'couch', 'swear', 'god', 'point', 'wa', 'watching', 'porn', 'around', 'wa', 'kitchen', 'table', 'know', 'heard', 'moaning', 'time', 'wa', 'around', 'cottage', 'onto', 'dad', 'laptop', 'found', 'bunch', 'legging', 'porn', 'video', 'also', 'stumbled', 'onto', 'camera', 'found', 'nude', 'gf', 'finding', 'age', 'year', 'old', 'dad', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'alone', 'lot', 'girlfriend', 'son', 'daughter', 'time', 'daughter', 'age', 'son', 'time', 'wa', 'dad', 'girlfriend', 'cottage', 'son', 'drink', 'started', 'give', 'small', 'amount', 'attention', 'sleazily', 'asked', 'girlfriend', 'night', 'later', 'pressure', 'giving', 'bj', 'want', 'boyfriend', 'morning', 'break', 'stone', 'cold', 'actually', 'thought', 'gon', 'na', 'together', 'actually', 'used', 'becomes', 'step', 'brother', 'year', 'think', 'got', 'really', 'lucky', 'fat', 'girl', 'time', 'would', 'take', 'lot', 'take', 'advantage', 'already', 'wa', 'first', 'memorable', 'sexual', 'experience', 'wa', 'good', 'kicked', 'room', 'right', 'nut', 'also', 'faint', 'memory', 'around', 'age', 'playing', 'younger', 'boy', 'closet', 'stripping', 'thankfully', 'got', 'caught', 'asked', 'mom', 'sister', 'ever', 'happened', 'clearly', 'mom', 'probably', 'would', 'make', 'scene', 'knowing', 'happened', 'said', 'recollect', 'think', 'going', 'insane', 'guilt', 'young', 'also', 'pushing', 'onto', 'another', 'person', 'way', 'get', 'really', 'fucked', 'also', 'people', 'think', 'larp', 'really', 'really', 'sad', 'legit', 'ha', 'happened', 'lying', 'smoke', 'weed', 'daily', 'self', 'harm', 'scar', 'wa', 'ten', 'cry', 'form', 'attention', 'physical', 'mental', 'regret', 'throughout', 'everything', 'lie', 'thank', 'kind', 'people', 'comment', 'section', 'opened', 'mind', 'lot', 'posting', 'getting', 'lot', 'wisdom', 'discussion', 'still', 'going', 'promise', 'best', 'replier']","{'neg': 0.125, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.9926}",negative

with her. we actually had a cookout planned that day so the family could come over and spend time with her. i can ’ t get the image of her slumped over in her chair out of my head. seeing her pale face and my heart just stopping. trying to wake her up even though i knew she wa gone. i feel so numb and i don ’ t understand why. i feel like i should be cry more but i just can ’ t anymore. nothing

passed , she woke me up very early at 2am asking if i wa okay. this wa very unlike her. i ’ d like to think in some way she knew what wa coming and wanted to spend some time with me before she left. my best friend and i recently reconnected right before my mom passing , they have been keeping me company which ha been really helpful. surprisingly i ’ ve been laughing a lot these last 2 day more than cry. i think my mom would have wanted that for me. although i ’ m still incredibly lonely and depressed about her passing , i feel like a weight ha been lifted off my shoulder. a my mother is no longer suffering in pain , she ’ s completely at peace now and where she always wanted : in the afterlife with my grandparent ❤️ again thank you to all the amazing wonderful people who took their time to leave me heartwarming advice and share their experience. i wa losing hope in humanity for the longest time but posting my experience here ha brought me nothing but peace and encouragement. you all are the most wonderful people imaginable and i can ’ t thank you enough. i really didn ’ t expect so many people to see this. i rarely ever share my feeling with anyone so this is very new for me. i ’ m going to try to book an appointment with a therapist sometime soon a sharing here ha showed me there ’ s nothing wrong with opening up to others. i love you all.

2023-09-17 17:59:09,129,Wife is going through breakdown and told me she wants to divorce,189,0.98,"my wife of almost 15 year ( we have been together for 21 ) decided she wanted to divorce me suddenly before a work trip. she knew i wa going alone and would be isolated. i spent the first few day in a hotel room in a strange country in complete shock. all the emotion ran through my head. i blamed myself , every little comment said. a few year ago she suffered from an incredibly paranoid phase ( thanks a lot pandemic ) where she thought the neighbour were spying on her and everyone wa out to get her. i work away a lot so i 'd come home to find her in this state. the `` camera `` always ended up being garden light or motion activated lamp , but when i pointed this out ( after 6 month not so tactfully ) she seemed to withdraw from me. after that we had a yoyoing relationship , where she would tell me one moment she love me , the next a divorce. we always sorted it out because i love her and want to support her and the kid unconditionally. i noticed her withdrawing. she would be in the same room with me , but not in spirit. she would explode at me in anger for the smallest thing , and the big thing she would n't seem to care about. she decided to go on medication , which helped. although she became more of a robot and lost all interest in any form of intimacy. it broke my heart. she came off of them about a year ago and thing started to improve. we became physical ( although at the worst of time she would have sex with me and throw it in my face on the next angry outburst , calling it rape etc. i never forced her into sex at all , but did complain we were n't intimate many time ). so , this latest situation wa only three day ago. i 'm still in a hotel halfway across the world , but my father rang me this morning. apparently she stayed at a female friend of ours house last night because she thought the neighbour were spying on her. she told me that she is hated in the area and that she will be sent back to her home country ( she ha been living in the uk for over 20 year and is from europe ) and the kid taken away. she strongly belief it to be true. my father picked her and the kid up and she adamantly wanted to report everything to the police regarding it. the police obviously did n't take it seriously. our neighbour are all 80'ish year old and not malicious. a pain , but not malicious. so a i sat here , pulling the thread on everything bad i 'd done ( because she will often use anything i 've done wrong a ammo ) when i get a call saying a mental health nurse is visiting her. she 's at my dad 's with the kid. i love her with all my heart. she 's a fantastic mother and person. but she will just torture me over and over and i stay because of this love. i worry about the kid and how she 'll cope. it break my heart. so i just carry on working , supporting her and trying to build our family. i 've turned into a persuer it seems , trying to hold u all together. always initiating conversation. trying to understand her feeling. she would n't make the effort to talk first. did she really mean she wanted a divorce? or is this just symptom of her mh? i ca n't leave her when she need me , and although this is effecting me i can take it. i want her to be safe and feel better but she 's breaking me down with the constant swing in feeling towards me. she is an amazing person at her best , but at her worst it 's like jekyll and hyde. ha anyone else experienced this? if so what wa the outcome? * edit * i wa arrested straight off the plane. they aarested me on suspicion of rape and coercion. i wa taken straight to the police station and wa just released pending investigation. i 've picked my car up , but i 'm not allowed to contact her , go to the house without police escort , go to her place of work ( which i would n't ) go to the school. where my kid attend or ask anyone to talk to her for me. i 've never raped her. she think having sex because she felt guilty whilst not objecting is rape because she did n't really want it. she 's saying this happened multiple time. i 'm feeling broken looking at the past history , i think she ha bpd. the re-writing of the past , the annoyance at very minor thing. disassociation and acting. obviously this is n't a proper diagnosis , but reading it all wa a lightbulb moment. i think i 've been discarded. the constant black and white thinking.",mentalhealth,Specific-Volume5652,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/16l7fn8/wife_is_going_through_breakdown_and_told_me_she/,105,192.8571428571429,3.857142857142861,0.0004111365000589,"['wife', 'almost', 'year', 'together', 'decided', 'wanted', 'divorce', 'suddenly', 'work', 'trip', 'knew', 'wa', 'going', 'alone', 'would', 'isolated', 'spent', 'first', 'day', 'hotel', 'room', 'strange', 'country', 'complete', 'shock', 'emotion', 'ran', 'head', 'blamed', 'every', 'little', 'comment', 'said', 'year', 'ago', 'suffered', 'incredibly', 'paranoid', 'phase', 'thanks', 'lot', 'pandemic', 'thought', 'neighbour', 'spying', 'everyone', 'wa', 'get', 'work', 'away', 'lot', 'come', 'home', 'find', 'state', 'camera', 'always', 'ended', 'garden', 'light', 'motion', 'activated', 'lamp', 'pointed', 'month', 'tactfully', 'seemed', 'withdraw', 'yoyoing', 'relationship', 'would', 'tell', 'one', 'moment', 'love', 'next', 'divorce', 'always', 'sorted', 'love', 'want', 'support', 'kid', 'unconditionally', 'noticed', 'withdrawing', 'would', 'room', 'spirit', 'would', 'explode', 'anger', 'smallest', 'thing', 'big', 'thing', 'would', 'seem', 'care', 'decided', 'go', 'medication', 'helped', 'although', 'became', 'robot', 'lost', 'interest', 'form', 'intimacy', 'broke', 'heart', 'came', 'year', 'ago', 'thing', 'started', 'improve', 'became', 'physical', 'although', 'worst', 'time', 'would', 'sex', 'throw', 'face', 'next', 'angry', 'outburst', 'calling', 'rape', 'etc', 'never', 'forced', 'sex', 'complain', 'intimate', 'many', 'time', 'latest', 'situation', 'wa', 'three', 'day', 'ago', 'still', 'hotel', 'halfway', 'across', 'world', 'father', 'rang', 'morning', 'apparently', 'stayed', 'female', 'friend', 'house', 'last', 'night', 'thought', 'neighbour', 'spying', 'told', 'hated', 'area', 'sent', 'back', 'home', 'country', 'ha', 'living', 'uk', 'year', 'europe', 'kid', 'taken', 'away', 'strongly', 'belief', 'true', 'father', 'picked', 'kid', 'adamantly', 'wanted', 'report', 'everything', 'police', 'regarding', 'police', 'obviously', 'take', 'seriously', 'neighbour', 'year', 'old', 'malicious', 'pain', 'malicious', 'sat', 'pulling', 'thread', 'everything', 'bad', 'done', 'often', 'use', 'anything', 'done', 'wrong', 'ammo', 'get', 'call', 'saying', 'mental', 'health', 'nurse', 'visiting', 'dad', 'kid', 'love', 'heart', 'fantastic', 'mother', 'person', 'torture', 'stay', 'love', 'worry', 'kid', 'cope', 'break', 'heart', 'carry', 'working', 'supporting', 'trying', 'build', 'family', 'turned', 'persuer', 'seems', 'trying', 'hold', 'u', 'together', 'always', 'initiating', 'conversation', 'trying', 'understand', 'feeling', 'would', 'make', 'effort', 'talk', 'first', 'really', 'mean', 'wanted', 'divorce', 'symptom', 'mh', 'ca', 'leave', 'need', 'although', 'effecting', 'take', 'want', 'safe', 'feel', 'better', 'breaking', 'constant', 'swing', 'feeling', 'towards', 'amazing', 'person', 'best', 'worst', 'like', 'jekyll', 'hyde', 'ha', 'anyone', 'else', 'experienced', 'wa', 'outcome', 'edit', 'wa', 'arrested', 'straight', 'plane', 'aarested', 'suspicion', 'rape', 'coercion', 'wa', 'taken', 'straight', 'police', 'station', 'wa', 'released', 'pending', 'investigation', 'picked', 'car', 'allowed', 'contact', 'go', 'house', 'without', 'police', 'escort', 'go', 'place', 'work', 'would', 'go', 'school', 'kid', 'attend', 'ask', 'anyone', 'talk', 'never', 'raped', 'think', 'sex', 'felt', 'guilty', 'whilst', 'objecting', 'rape', 'really', 'want', 'saying', 'happened', 'multiple', 'time', 'feeling', 'broken', 'looking', 'past', 'history', 'think', 'ha', 'bpd', 'past', 'annoyance', 'minor', 'thing', 'disassociation', 'acting', 'obviously', 'proper', 'diagnosis', 'reading', 'wa', 'lightbulb', 'moment', 'think', 'discarded', 'constant', 'black', 'white', 'thinking']","{'neg': 0.119, 'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': -0.387}",negative

and this may sound very strange , but i have a bunch of different world in my mind with several different people who are all basically the opposite of me. this initially started over quarantine because i wa stuck in the same house a my family. they like to dig into your insecurity and even made me feel like i ’ m ugly , so i thought up a girl who doesn ’ t have those insecurity and wa just all around beautiful and imagining what kind of life she would lead. the only one i ’ ll be going over in this post is “ sasha ” which wa a name i had liked due to being a big bratz fan when i wa younger and i had hated my name because it ’ s not very common and not only had an apostrophe , but also ha a capital letter in the middle and wa often made fun of. since then , i have learned to love my name and switched her name to be mine. to better describe her and her life , she ’ s a beautiful dark skinned afro-latina woman who ha long dark brown hair , she ha an hourglass figure , and the most beautiful brown eye in term of look and i often time will stay awake simply imagining her face and wanting to cry or scream. in term of what she ’ s like , she ha a very sweet personality , but she ’ s much more confident than me and take crap from no one , she ’ s seen a the most perfect woman originally at school and later a an actress. she at some point got married to my dream man and they had kid who were practically the definition of perfection. that wa originally just my little escape from reality , but it very quickly started consuming my day to day life because i ’ ll start thinking about this during important thing or shut myself off from the world to get a quiet place to focus on how to make that world more so perfect. my parent aren ’ t the mental health help type so i generally talk to my older sister about this stuff , but that doesn ’ t help because my sister ha never felt anything even remotely similar to how i feel. i already know that i need mental health help because of how awful my parent are ( every kid before me ha needed mental help too ) i , however , need to know if this is something that is concerning before i talk more openly to friend and other family member about this. this is extremely specific so i doubt that anyone ha experienced anything like this , but if you have can you give me some advice and/or tell me what this could be

`` or `` how much doe this person 's nose ruin their face? `` and so on. we wrote the question together. before she did this exposure i expressed multiple time that i feared i would be at risk of self-harming upon seeing the result , and that i really did not want to do it. i asked if i could opt out and she said yes but continued to bring it up and ask me why i would n't do it until i eventually agreed. the result came in and were varied. a couple people rated me a `` 10 `` for beauty , others a `` 4. `` more than half said that my nose doe in fact ruin my face ( rating of 6-10 out of 10 ). these result were very distressing to me , le because of the number themselves and more so because i felt coerced into doing the exposure and because there wa no follow up or after care. the nurse read me the result , gave me the `` raw data `` and excused me from her office. this wa in july , it 's mid-october now , and i am still struggling with this information. this is of course not the `` cause `` of my dysmorphia , but i 'm feeling unable to get past what feel like confirmation of my ugliness. i have trouble leaving my apartment or working while my partner is home because i fear he will look at me and see how ugly i am. it is disrupting my every day. i am in therapy with a general counsellor and also a trauma therapist , so two session a week , and i do n't seem to be getting anywhere with the bdd. i also research it and read study and article about the disorder to try to better understand it. i consider myself in most way a very reasonable , giving , dedicated person , friend , and partner , but i am so totally fixated on my ugliness sometimes that i fear i will drive others away. i guess i am asking two thing : 1. is there any hope for dysmorphic patient?

ran away and i wa screaming for help. no one called the police or ambulance i had to call his dad to pick u up after that incident i havent been able to sleep i got put on 5 pill by my psychiatrist to deal with the trauma and flashback. i have never went to a party/club and that wa our 4th time out. yesterday at new year the second time we have went out since the incident a man threatened me for moving a jacket , which i moved so i could sit down ( it wa n't his , it wa n't mine , the guy who 's jacket it wa is up dancing he doe n't even know the guy ) i wa n't about to sit on someone 's jacket so shifted it up a bit so i could sit with my group. it wa moved 5 inch and he had 2 seat of space ). i could feel my anxiety creep up after the threat and my boyfriend told him to calm down , there is no issue here and this man slid up behind me ( he wa 2 metre away ) and started threatening my boyfriend telling him to meet him outside. my boyfriend rolled his eye ignored him and just put his arm around me and kept talking to the group. at this point i wa having flashback , i started having a bad panic attack , i could n't breath , tear were streaming , i wa gasping for breath. boyfriend and his cousin noticed and got me outside so i could breathe where the bouncer came up to say he could understand where he wa coming from since he wa there first ( i still have no clue how me not wanting to sit on a stranger jacket and moving it beside me so i wa n't on top of it is worthy of his behaviour ) at this point i wa just saying between gasp ' i dont actually care about that i

force her to stay in a marriage that she doe not think she can be happy in. it ’ s rough , guy and i am not looking forward to our conversation but , i need to find closure one way or the other or i ’ m going to lose my mind. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * update * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i have just reopened reddit since posting this. there are a lot of comment and i will get around to answering those of you i am able to a i am able to. just a a little general answer a to how thing are at the moment : i ’ ve found peace in this situation and have been preparing myself for whatever the final outcome of my marriage is. i ’ ve been staying with my parent for a week , i ’ ve been getting counseling , i wa started in an antidepressant and right now i ’ m going through the wonderful effect that starting an antidepressant brings. my wife and i are separating for a year , she is taking our dog and will be living in iowa with her grandmother for the next year until she ha to return for school. i feel like i ’ m starting to come out of a lifetime of being on autopilot and feel hope for my future for the first time in year. that ’ s all i can think of for now , head a little fuzzy because of antidepressant but overall mental health is looking up at the moment. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

2023-11-09 02:09:01,358,I was sexually abused as a boy,94,0.97,"well , that 's the first time i talk about it at all. i 'm 20 now and i suffered abuse since i can not remember until i wa 11. it took a long time to realize what happened to me wa wrong and a longer time to realize i wa not the wrong side. until this , how i say , my mind wa a straight up hell. & # x200b ; i wa a shy and isolated child. i actually talked a lot with my close one , but introvert at all , nothing wrong. i remember when i wa around 5 , my grandmother told me to lie down with her in the bed. i refused at first , but she insisted so much that i accepted. she then started to talk about thing involving sexual organ and how it wa important to me to know the female body ( remembering , i wa 5 ). she asked me if i had ever seen a woman naked , so i told something like `` i 've taken shower with my cousin ( my age , call her 'ana ' ) ``. then she literally pulled down her pant and asked me to touch it , to `` know how it is ``. i remember feeling very embarrassed and uncomfortable , and she said something like `` you have not to feel any wrong with this , it 's like your cousin , but bigger ``. fucked up. & # x200b ; later , when i wa 7-8 , i wa pretty often in her house , since my parent worked the whole day. so i often ate , took shower and slept there. just to say , some night i could n't sleep because that bedroom made me terrified ( i actually did n't know why at this time ). my younger brother and cousin ( male ) also were often there. at this age , she put u together in bath and , honestly , nothing inappropriated ever happened during these time. for some reason , the disturbing thing happened only when we were alone , and she developed some creepy obsession with me , i will explain later. & # x200b ; she had one of those electric massage tool , you know. she liked to massage my body with that , and i liked it in the beggining. she massaged my shouders , arm and foot , and that felt really good. but with time , she started to spend more and more time putting that thing over my chest and leg , until she put it over my genitals. i think that wa my first orgasm , because the feeling wa so intense and unexpected ( also my body wa probably aroused by the preliminary contact , but i could n't know what is wa ). i had never experienced an erection at this time , but even so my genitals were `` wet `` when i went to bathroom. she made it more time , but not so intense , she kinda passed the tool around my leg and stomach and sometimes put it over the genitals , for a little time. she always told me i wa her favourite grandchild , the most handsome , and other kind of praise that made me feel disgusting. & # x200b ; sadly , the sign of abuse started to appear at that time. i became more introvert in school and , sometimes , i really froze when talking to people , and could n't make many friend. i became aroused too. i felt i had the need of masturbate , not periodically because it felt good , but almost every day led by pure anxiety and that felling that it 's the only way you were taught to do. fortunately , i never extended this to other people , but always kept it to myself ( actually it fucked my mental health , but i honestly prefer this than become an abuser and victimizing and hurt other people ). i remember taking bath with my cousin ( yeah , that one i told in the bed ) at my 9-10 and i never made any sexual play or talk with her. i only had a bit of curiosity about her vagina ( also she about my penis ) , but those thought faded away when we started playing of throwing water at each other and make silly beard with foam. those are actually good memory , which is kinda ironical in my opinion. & # x200b ; so i hit puberty. i wa 11 and , for privacy reason , i told her i did n't want to take my bath with cousin or brother. anyways , she wa until in the bedroom ( there were a bedroom and bathroom , no door between them ) and it wa not a problem at all , i 've taken many bath with she watching before. one day , after i finished the bath , i got up to shower the foam off and asked her for the towel. i always made this , but that time , well , i had an erection. not first time , but first in front of someone. well , she basically touched me very inapropriately , not going to give detail here. & # x200b ; i took bath there only a few time more , until i stopped totally to go there and stayed alone in home. in these day before i took this decision , her obsession about me and my body became sick. when i wa in the bathroom , she started to massage my body and making awful comment about my penis. yeah , some sick thing like `` how can something be so thick , do you do exercise for it to grow? `` , `` the girl will be crazy when you put this in front of them `` and `` your girlfriend will be a very happy girl with this ``. sorry for the girl reading this. uh , my part are actually very normal , and it 's not a problem to me. i really care way more about feeling and caring than the body , and i 'm pretty sure i could only stay with a girl if she felt the same. but now i know that she wa doing had never to do with caring or increasing my self steem , but some distrubing way to catch me psychologically. & # x200b ; still in this bath part , she touched me very time , in the whole body. one day she took my phone that i had left in my pant and started reading my personal message. there wa really nothing i should be worried about , but it made me very uncomfortable too. another day , after i took my clothes off , she said me to wait because she wanted to take a bath first. so she undressed in front of me and i obviously had an erection. she did n't touch me but i could see by her face that she wa very satisfied producing that. that day wa the more disturbing. after she finished , she told me to get in ( she got out and dressed first , fortunately ) and take my turn. i did , and when i get out , she told me to lie down in the bed , because she had noticed i had `` a rash on my inner thigh `` and she needed to see it. i honestly can not describe what i wa feeling. a mix of anxiety , fear , and somehow , arousal. when she pulled my towel off , i had a full erection. she put an oinment in my thigh and then started with that twisted comment about my body , penis and girl. so she put an oil in her hand and started , you know what. it may feel disturbing , but she moved her hand so passionately over my testicle and penis that it really looked like she wa pleasing herself. i knew i should stop that , i should run away and tell someone , but at that time i felt so , uh , horny maybe , that i just could n't stop it. i feel it extremely disgusting , but i think whoever experienced an orgasm know exactly what i 'm talking about. well , then i came in her hand and that wa the last time i went there. & # x200b ; the last part wa the worst of all , no doubt. i wa in later middle school and i had always got the best grade in every subject , but my grade `` suddenly `` decreased to hell. to worsen the situation , my math teacher wa very harsh and blamed me everytime for getting bad grade. i stopped doing thing i liked before and lost 30kg ( 66 pound ) in a very short time. i got also kind of addicted to porn , since it wa the only thing that could distract me even for a few minute. the rest of the time wa pure torment in my head. i also had nocturnal panic and some weird thing like imagining that there were demon or monster in my bedroom. my family is evangelical , and it did n't help me much. everytime i went to the church , i could feel anything but shame and guilt , feeling a i wa not worth of being there. and , since i had not friend or someone i could trust to open myself , i always ended up believing those thoughs were true. & # x200b ; when i wa to get into middle school , i moved to other school. it 's not necessary to say that my mind wa not healthy and i could n't make lasting relationship bond. i wa getting good grade again , but no one of my friend of that time remains close to me today , except by that cousin , ana , who studied with me in high school. we had a good friendship , and our talk are almost always about music , school and politics. since we are relative and were very close in childhood , she felt ok to talk about sex with me sometimes , but always in a respectful way. her concern were most about having sex before marriage , and i said her if she wanted to be with her boyfriend for life and both felt ok with that , it should n't there be any problem ( she 's with the same guy until today and they are happy , i feel really glad for her ). today she 's in 2nd year to become a psychologist. sometimes i think about talking these thing with her , but i really do n't feel secure to open up. & # x200b ; in my last year in middle school , i got really depressed. i lost my will to live and have a future , i did n't got into college and abandoned all my social circle. the only thing i did in this time wa work , go to church and sleep. despite my shame feeling never left , i always prayed to god to help me , at least , do n't give up on everything. i think i 'm doing well actually. & # x200b ; in my 19 , i took my drive license. i thought i would n't be able to do it , due to my high anxiety level and a almost constant headache i have , but i did and i drive pretty well. i am also going to do exam to get into a college the next week. i 'm not full confident that i will pa but i promised to not desperate and try again next year if i fail. i also found a girl that became one of the most important part of my life. we are not in love yet , but i can feel she like me the same way i like her. she laugh at all my joke and pay attention when i 'm talking , and it really make a great difference. i do n't struggle with thought like `` if i had found someone like her before i could have avoided a lot of suffering `` because i know that find someone like her is very rare and , anyways , she turn my day way lighter and brighter , and hard thing have become easier to do. my greatest fear wa how my body would react when we got close. i 'm not talking about sex , and i do n't want to think about it until the marriage ( we 're both evangelicals so it 's ok ) , but normal physical contact. fortunately , i discovered that i like her touch , and stay close feel very confortable , like the opposite i used to feel. i 'm not gon na lie , i still have nightmare , flashback and panic , i still struggle with porn sometimes ( very very few time , but when it happens i feel like those day ) , but i 'm doing my best. when i feel depressed , it 's like the time around me had stopped and i do n't have force to do anything , but i 'm taking le time to recover than in other time. i 've made good friend in the church and work , and the familiy of my girl is like a second family for me. well , today my life is divided by few day when i feel absolutely hopeless and some day when i have force , even feeling bad , shameful and empty i can do my best to have a future when i 'll be free of this. & # x200b ; p : if someone is worried about my brother and cousin , they are all well. i really do n't believe they went through this thing , i 've always kept an eye over all of them to not let the same thing that happened to me happen to them , and they are all ok , both physical and mentally. i hope everyone who is reading this and ha been through similar thing to have the best day in your life.",mentalhealth,Natanael329,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/17r2c44/i_was_sexually_abused_as_a_boy/,38,96.90721649484536,2.9072164948453576,0.0002065886346229,"['well',

he ’ ll come in my room gully dressed , but grabbing is crotch and asking me to stroke it through his jean. he always comment on my body and always try and sometimes doe grab my butt. he say , word for word “ you have such a fucking juicy a ” “ get on the bed ” “ i ’ m gon na fuck you ”. he moan our name and will randomly be sitting their and moan “ oh oh i ’ m gon na cum ”. there ’ s so much more but in the moment i can ’ t remember. now i know , the simple solution to this would be to lock my door. but he will break down my door. or i could tell my parent , but they already know and they don ’ t care. they say “ he ’ s crazy , there ’ s nothing we can do about it ”. they don ’ t understand that my brother action are effecting me mentally. another solution would be for me to move out.

( i haven ’ t read all of them esp the very recent ones—was planning to reply to them , but i ’ m losing all my energy now a it ’ s 3 am here already in my place ). a little tmi , i ’ m also diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder. here ’ s what my therapist said : [ … you can send it to your friend , or post in anonymous twitter account with 0 follower. you can take a many a you can ( to get you distracted ) then back it up on your cloud/drive account. send it to yourself is also another alternative. make sure those photo do not feature your face. better yet , keep your phone under lock & key and only retrieve it when you are calmed down. hope it help. you got this! ] what i did by far : 1. creating a spare insta account with 0 follower , started by uploading my normal , non-nudes selfies , ended up not sending nude at all because i wa too busy looking at my selfies and uploading them right before i got to open my hidden nude folder haha ( sorry if it sound too cringeworthy—kinda feel cute these day ). 2. impulsively uploaded normal , proper selfies to a subreddit and somehow felt better about it ( except for some of the disgusting dm part ). hope it doesn ’ t sound narcissistic but , it felt good looking at the number of dm request though i didn ’ t reply to them [ but i truly don ’ t appreciate some of the dm coming from this particular post from r/mentalhealth because , apparently , those people intentionally take advantage of me and no , i don ’ t reply to them : ) ] 3. talked to someone , felt good. made up with my crush , had a good talk with him and he said sorry for not being there for me for the past few day. had a video call with him a well. after ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) i felt calmer , and after ( 3 ) i felt amazing. why i try hard not to post my nude : [ i saw some of you suggesting me to post on reddit with a throwaway account without my face on , or creating an of account , or sending it to friend. ] why i clearly avoid doing that : a weird a it may sound , i ’ m actually just trying to honor my idealistic principle of thinking that nude = exclusive , i particularly take them for someone special and send them only to that particular person. when i said i wanted to send nude this morning i didn ’ t take anything new—i wa about to send my old nude from a few month ago. which wa taken for my crush. in my previous experience , i had to send my nude at least to 2 or 3 people not out of my will , i just kinda got “ groomed ” onto it or because i couldn ’ t clearly say no—only to regret it afterwards. wasn ’ t even thinking of my own safety at the time , i wa solely disappointed at how i “ betrayed ” my own principle ( not betraying my crush , since i ’ m not yet exclusively in a committed relationship with him anyway ). yeah i ’ m idealistic af. and this i guess is my very first time , for whatever reason ( seeking validation? wanting some tension? not sure , i guess the first one ) i want to share my nude when ( presumably ) i ’ m about to enter my hypomanic episode ( in my previous hypomanic episode i wa about to fuck random a dude , thank god i canceled the plan ). and that ’ s why i wa very confused , by my brain wa still alerted that i shouldn ’ t be doing that at all. so yeah. sorry for the long a update. thank you for some of the nice and supportive dm — had read some of them , but i no longer have the energy to reply for today. will do so the moment i wake up this morning : )",mentalhealth,haechanbaragi,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/192zs06/bipolar_mixed_episode_if_i_have_a_strong_urgency/,56,92.04545454545456,11.045454545454549,0.0001962242386644,"['yes', 'basically', 'title', 'say', 'fully', 'aware', 'could', 'dangerous', 'still', 'want', 'kind', 'preventive', 'measure', 'really', 'lose', 'mind', 'right', 'kind', 'pissed', 'basically', 'everyone', 'life', 'moment', 'even', 'crush', 'perceive', 'kind', 'savior', 'normally', 'send', 'nude', 'release', 'tension', 'safe', 'way', 'share', 'nude', 'two', 'stranger', 'previously', 'regretted', 'afterward', 'felt', 'unsafe', 'edit', 'stop', 'nude', 'gon', 'na', 'block', 'additional', 'edit', 'wan', 'na', 'give', 'update', 'talking', 'therapist', 'reading', 'suggestion', 'read', 'esp', 'recent', 'planning', 'reply', 'losing', 'energy', 'already', 'place', 'little', 'tmi', 'also', 'diagnosed', 'histrionic', 'personality', 'disorder', 'therapist', 'said', 'send', 'friend', 'post', 'anonymous', 'twitter', 'account', 'follower', 'take', 'many', 'get', 'distracted', 'back', 'account', 'send', 'also', 'another', 'alternative', 'make', 'sure', 'photo', 'feature', 'face', 'better', 'yet', 'keep', 'phone', 'lock', 'key', 'retrieve', 'calmed', 'hope', 'help', 'got', 'far', 'creating', 'spare', 'insta', 'account', 'follower', 'started', 'uploading', 'normal', 'selfies', 'ended', 'sending', 'nude', 'wa', 'busy', 'looking', 'selfies', 'uploading', 'right', 'got', 'open', 'hidden', 'nude', 'folder', 'haha', 'sorry', 'sound', 'feel', 'cute', 'day', 'impulsively', 'uploaded', 'normal', 'proper', 'selfies', 'subreddit', 'somehow', 'felt', 'better', 'except', 'disgusting', 'dm', 'part', 'hope', 'sound', 'narcissistic', 'felt', 'good', 'looking', 'number', 'dm', 'request', 'though', 'reply', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'dm', 'coming', 'particular', 'post', 'apparently', 'people', 'intentionally', 'take', 'advantage', 'reply', 'talked', 'someone', 'felt', 'good', 'made', 'crush', 'good', 'talk', 'said', 'sorry', 'past', 'day', 'video', 'call', 'well', 'felt', 'calmer', 'felt', 'amazing', 'try', 'hard', 'post', 'nude', 'saw', 'suggesting', 'post', 'reddit', 'throwaway', 'account', 'without', 'face', 'creating', 'account', 'sending', 'friend', 'clearly', 'avoid', 'weird', 'may', 'sound', 'actually', 'trying', 'honor', 'idealistic', 'principle', 'thinking', 'nude', 'exclusive', 'particularly', 'take', 'someone', 'special', 'send', 'particular', 'person', 'said', 'wanted', 'send', 'nude', 'morning', 'take', 'anything', 'wa', 'send', 'old', 'nude', 'month', 'ago', 'wa', 'taken', 'crush', 'previous', 'experience', 'send', 'nude', 'least', 'people', 'kinda', 'got', 'groomed', 'onto', 'clearly', 'say', 'regret', 'afterwards', 'even', 'thinking', 'safety', 'time', 'wa', 'solely', 'disappointed', 'betrayed', 'principle', 'betraying', 'crush', 'since', 'yet', 'exclusively', 'committed', 'relationship', 'anyway', 'yeah', 'idealistic', 'af', 'guess', 'first', 'time', 'whatever', 'reason', 'seeking', 'validation', 'wanting', 'tension', 'sure', 'guess', 'first', 'one', 'want', 'share', 'nude', 'presumably', 'enter', 'hypomanic', 'episode', 'previous', 'hypomanic', 'episode', 'wa', 'fuck', 'random', 'dude', 'thank', 'god', 'canceled', 'plan', 'wa', 'confused', 'brain', 'wa', 'still', 'alerted', 'yeah', 'sorry', 'long', 'update', 'thank', 'nice', 'supportive', 'dm', 'read', 'longer', 'energy', 'reply', 'today', 'moment', 'wake', 'morning']","{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.72, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.9979}",positive

people. my sister ’ s mental illness is tearing my family apart and i don ’ t know what to do. also , just a a disclaimer , a her only brother/sibling , i obviously do care for my sister very much , but she make it difficult to maintain any kind of positive relationship. i am in no way on here to drag her , and will not be using her name. my sister , who is 34 now ( 4 year older than me ) , ha suffered mental health issue since she wa a teenager , but it came to a head her senior year of college. she had a manic episode on thanksgiving day of 2010 , left campus , passed out on the side of the highway , and wound up in the hand of the highway patrol. i ’ m still super thankful she had the wherewithal to call them/anyone herself , i hate to think of what could have happened. the detail are still pretty sketchy , but are not the important factor. she wa never the same , and wa almost totally incoherent for a solid month after in the psych ward. she ha basically been in and out of psych ward around the state at least 2-4 time a year in the ensuing 13 year since. the original diagnosis wa some sort of medical gray area schizo-effective bipolar disorder , but i believe it ha evolved into borderline personality disorder. she ended up leaving her career over it , and is now disabled. every year that pas since she started getting her disability check , her health ha gotten steadily worse. on top of the issue i ’ ve stated , she ’ s also severely overweight and diabetic , can ’ t handle her own finance , ha had a bunch of issue with her thyroid , and her med either completely sedate her or throw her into a non stop mania , and she is incapable of functioning for days/weeks at time because of it. my parent were totally unprepared for all of this. my sister wa an honor student , had all kind of accomplishment to be proud of in high school , and sort of seemed to have her life planned out when she started college. i know no one doe , but no parent is ever ready for something like this to happen , it wa and is still pretty traumatic. my folk still look after her ( she ha never been able to live on her own ) and she put u all through the wringer daily. i moved back home 2 year ago when i wa on some truly hard time. at first it wa fine , and i learned to be patient with her. now her attitude ha become so vindictive to the point she assumes we all hate her , and that our own mother ha a vendetta out to screw her over. she ’ s completely delusional about this , and i ’ ve had some argument with her over it when my temper boil over. i ’ m not going to let anyone cuss out either of our parent ( in front of me and them ). our mother is her power of attorney and control most of her saving at this point. it ’ s just the way my si talk about her , you ’ d think our mother beat the hell out of u a kid or something , it ’ s some truly nasty shit she say. she is struggling now more than i think she ever ha , her mania and mood swing are so bad that she ’ s delusional and angry all the time , every day. it ’ s getting very hard to keep being patient , and to stay at home through all of this. my parent and i have all agreed that this behavior is making u all miserable and sort of codependent with her suffering. sister is making all of our home life very chaotic. i get to hear her screaming or sobbing at the top of her lung nearly every day , usually directed at me or whoever is home. and i ’ m not sure she even realizes it or care how she ’ s affecting u. in turn it is making me callous to her entire condition. it ’ s hard enough to even be at home witnessing her being this disrespectful. this mean if i ’ m not working 50-60+ hour a week , i am at home arguing with what ’ s left of my only sibling and watching her life fall deeper into the shitter. sister is supposed to receive a deal on affordable housing very soon , but we all of course seriously doubt that she will be able to take care of herself. none of u know what to do. we assume she will move out and be back home again within a few month and in even worse shape. and it especially wear down my retired father , who she ha been truly awful to in the past few month. i guess the point i ’ m getting at is that i can ’ t figure out what to do now. i feel like if i move out , i completely waste my opportunity to save load of cash so that i can buy a home. i have begun saving , and it is quite possible by next spring if i keep working and saving. but if i stay , i also have to keep dealing with this ... i think it ’ s fair to say she will never be “ cured , ” and that the best she can hope for is that it get more manageable. that also seems unlikely. i went back to online therapy recently , and am considering going back to my old in-person therapist to work out some of these issue and other personal problem i ’ ve had over the past few year. my si and my parent have also totally rejected going to family/group therapy whenever i bring it up. if anything i ’ d love to

balling on the floor i wa hyperventilating i couldn ’ t breathe my bf told me he will call them and inform them of the situation and that i can not speak due to this. he gave them a call and told them i wa having a breakdown i can not speak on the phone and that i am in no condition to work today this wa 7 hour before my shift ( when i have these breakdown they last at least the entire day but it 's very rare when these thing happen i usually can hold my composure ) so he got off the phone and said ok so what i ’ m gon na say may upset you and i ’ m very sorry and i knew immediately. he said that they said “ is this like a long-term thing because we need worker who aren ’ t you know. that. so we are gon na end her employment because we need employee who can give their best attitude and show up to work if she want to apply in 6 month she can but she ha to be happy and healthy ” i wa just flabbergasted i didn ’ t even know what to say this wa the first and only time i called in. the

calling out i ’ ve always been an honest person but seeing some of these comment made me realize that sometimes you got ta just say “ i got the flu ” or something i actually will talk to my bf because we do live together if we should take legal advice or honestly just leave it a it is luckily because we do have rent so i have to work my bf messaged his bos if they could hire me at his job and they scheduled me for an interview tomorrow so hopefully it go well. i wa told by him we can not work the same shift due to the risk of u breaking up and causing drama in his work environment which is

2023-07-26 23:56:16,503,Is it normal to conclude life at 30?,69,0.99,"i 'm 27 , i 'm from london uk , i work a job that go against my personality , i have maybe 2 friend at most , i have never had a girlfriend for the entirety of my life & i do n't think i ever will. growing up i wa never diagnosed for my mental health but i 'm convinced i 'm on the spectrum for autism due to the fact i 've dealt with body dysmorphic disorder since a early a age 4 & used maladaptive daydreaming a a coping mechanism to this day. safe to say my reality is not meeting up the standard , i feel like i 've plateaued in life when it come to improving my mental health. i 'm turning 28 in november & i have never left the country once , never really enjoyed my 20 due to the fact i ca n't adjust to social cue. everything feel forced with me , i used to think i wa ugly growing up & i relentlessly focused all my energy on improving my physical appearance. safe to say now i think im handsome due to the change of reception i get from woman but i still do n't believe it due to how i wa treated by them when i wa younger ( ptsd perhaps? ) ... the breaking point for me now is knowing my mum may never see me have a child at this rate , she is ill & currently disabled in her mid 50. it break my heart all the time knowing she want to see her grandchild & i also want this but i 've always hated myself so much to the point i could never comprehend letting a woman into my life. i feel like i can offer physical attraction , mental wisdom & a reassuring outlook on actual relationship despite never being in one. but outside that , i work an average job , i 've got no friend , i 'm a virgin , i ca n't drive & i 'm limited on what enjoyment i can actively bring to a woman due to the fact i 've never experienced much in my life. this itself ha recently stopped me going for a woman i really admire even though she is also going through her own grievance. i 've always told myself if i just had a taste of what life a normal person get to enjoy , i 'd be way better but i 'm yet to come close to those necessity. i 'm inclined to end my life at 30 if i 'm yet to develop & change. i can be the wisest in the shed , without experience i have no proof for my brain to validate a fixated behaviour pattern of normal functional living. i am saddened at the idea to hurt my mother further by ending my life at 30 if i 'm to be in the same boat but something in me ca n't accept how people have it easy in life & i do n't even have the basic privilege to even live life. i feel trapped & i feel burdened by my brain , i 'm tired of rationalising all the time. tired of relying on dopamine from content or being reliant on endorphin release from the gym to feel positive. i 'm putting a positive front but deep down i 'm dying inside. people can say it 's `` depression `` , but like i said if i have n't experienced anything my brain ha no proof to feel validated , for example it 's like labeling someone for laughing because they got tickled. granted the circumstance i 'm in , feeling the way i do is a reasonable byproduct and the fact i persevered with low self esteem for my entire life , it show i 'm far from just dwelling over the idea of depression. all i can say is , i 'll be taking it to the next level but i 'll be open about my experience. if this doe n't work then nothing will work for me. god know how many people i 've let slipped out my life simply because i felt i wa n't good enough and some of them may have even loved

2023-05-31 06:19:40,549,I spent years dealing with panic attacks and debilitating anxiety but haven’t had one in 7 years. Here’s what I learned through self-healing without medication. I hope it’s helpful to others.,60,0.91,"• anxiety and panic attack were something i wa experiencing , not something that i “ had ”. letting go of the idea that this wa a disorder or something i had to deal with for life wa really important. • meditation in the beginning felt impossible because my nervous system wa so disregulated that my mind and body didn ’ t feel safe when i gave it space to heal. persisting wa the single best thing i ever did for myself. • i didn ’ t have any self-love or self-care. i realised i didn ’ t know how to say no to people or thing. i wa constantly busy and exhausted. i would make myself available to others when deep down it didn ’ t suit me. starting to say no wa really hard at first but it ha been the second best thing i have ever done for myself. • i realised i had been operating from my head and wa virtually cut off from my body. i could label my emotion mentally but wa never actually feeling those emotion. meditating allowed me to start feeling safe in my body for the first time in probably 20 year. it also helped me to become more deeply connected to myself , life and other people. my relationship have been so fulfilling and nourishing a a result. • i realised how long i had been living in a state of survival and how much of that resulted from childhood trauma. instead of running from it , i began to deal with the experience i had growing up and the reality of what that had meant for me. i could then make different choice that truly supported me instead of doing thing that kept inducing anxiety and stress. • accepting the reality for thing a they are instead of how i wanted them to be wa important. the longer i denied my own reality , the worse i continued to feel. trying to hold on to the story of what i wanted wa far more painful than being honest about how they actually are. • drug & alcohol had been a way to feel good and confident in the moment but always intensified the anxiety and panic attack. when i began to calm my nervous system and stopped living in survival mode 24/7 , i felt connected and content within which naturally meant i didn ’ t feel an urge to do those thing. • caffeine helped me to deal with my lack of energy that resulted from never sleeping but it wa always perpetuating the problem. the more i had , the more anxious i felt and the more often i had panic attack. learning how to put my self-care and need first meant that i could finally do thing for myself that i really needed to heal instead of quick fix. • anxiety still present in my life but it is natural , healthy anxiety that come and go depending on what ’ s happening in my life. it is no longer debilitating anxiety and for that reason , i can learn from what it is telling me. i now have a healthy relationship with anxiety rather than being terrified of it. • i have learned to always trust my intuition and gut feeling even though it feel incredibly scary at time to go against the story or conditioned

how can i once again believe in myself? ha anyone experienced this , what can i do? tldr : my life fell apart when my wife left me and my kid four year ago , and my social life and self confidence have been in shamble and i 'm trying to rebuild but do n't know where to start and am asking for help from this community to help me get back on my foot and be able to at least carry a conversation without feeling like i 'm not worth someone else 's time. thank you , humbly. i look forward to your input!",mentalhealth,petinisaur,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/15vxdk4/my_life_crashed_down_around_me_how_can_i_rebuild/,32,56.56565656565657,0.5656565656565675,0.0001205877351463,"['hey', 'everyone', 'hoping', 'coming', 'find', 'insight', 'pull', 'rut', 'found', 'back', 'story', 'wa', 'married', 'three', 'kid', 'wa', 'executive', 'director', 'non', 'profit', 'big', 'city', 'large', 'social', 'circle', 'friend', 'thing', 'wa', 'quite', 'happy', 'content', 'life', 'wa', 'wealthy', 'wa', 'happy', 'thats', 'monetary', 'gain', 'needed', 'fast', 'forward', 'year', 'ago', 'spouse', 'grew', 'bored', 'started', 'wall', 'thing', 'like', 'spending', 'day', 'week', 'away', 'home', 'figure', 'work', 'take', 'care', 'kid', 'eventually', 'found', 'wa', 'dating', 'another', 'man', 'asked', 'work', 'resolve', 'leave', 'chose', 'leave', 'held', 'onto', 'non', 'profit', 'year', 'finally', 'giving', 'mental', 'health', 'ha', 'horrid', 'little', 'improvement', 'last', 'four', 'year', 'relationship', 'time', 'failed', 'blame', 'mentally', 'capable', 'facilitating', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'healthy', 'way', 'realized', 'need', 'step', 'back', 'work', 'regular', 'job', 'work', 'nice', 'structure', 'longer', 'disciplined', 'enough', 'run', 'schedule', 'perhaps', 'motivation', 'almost', 'social', 'circle', 'reason', 'blame', 'look', 'may', 'prettiest', 'man', 'people', 'liked', 'back', 'understand', 'problem', 'go', 'work', 'struggle', 'carry', 'conversation', 'often', 'find', 'trying', 'escape', 'conversation', 'time', 'craving', 'interaction', 'weird', 'want', 'friend', 'want', 'talk', 'people', 'friend', 'call', 'avoid', 'call', 'pick', 'forced', 'go', 'karaoke', 'last', 'night', 'local', 'bar', 'invited', 'friend', 'every', 'single', 'one', 'declined', 'sat', 'wondering', 'wa', 'wrong', 'believe', 'think', 'core', 'issue', 'see', 'failure', 'think', 'people', 'judging', 'ugly', 'face', 'want', 'friend', 'feel', 'like', 'loser', 'feel', 'completely', 'alone', 'get', 'much', 'three', 'kid', 'yo', 'full', 'time', 'want', 'rekindle', 'friendship', 'old', 'friend', 'reach', 'seem', 'interested', 'message', 'back', 'want', 'try', 'make', 'new', 'friend', 'thought', 'creating', 'something', 'new', 'terrifies', 'want', 'return', 'social', 'creature', 'used', 'want', 'able', 'carry', 'conversation', 'build', 'deep', 'relationship', 'anyone', 'even', 'one', 'person', 'ca', 'crippled', 'fear', 'get', 'leave', 'someone', 'come', 'break', 'room', 'u', 'two', 'live', 'nightmare', 'want', 'close', 'someone', 'ca', 'rebuild', 'confidence', 'believe', 'ha', 'anyone', 'experienced', 'tldr', 'life', 'fell', 'apart', 'wife', 'left', 'kid', 'four', 'year', 'ago', 'social', 'life', 'self', 'confidence', 'shamble', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'know', 'start', 'asking', 'help', 'community', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'foot', 'able', 'least', 'carry', 'conversation', 'without', 'feeling', 'like', 'worth', 'someone', 'else', 'time', 'thank', 'humbly', 'look', 'forward', 'input']","{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.703, 'pos': 0.184, 'compound': 0.9947}",positive

My Scary Experience of What It Was Like,48,0.98,"\ * \ * trigger warning : my story includes suic attempt\ * \ * & # x200b ; im coming up on 4 year since surviving a pretty brutal attempt on my life , and wanted to share my story , some hope , a little advice , and reflect on what my life look like now/what i would 've missed out on. jan 6 , 2020 , id been in a dark place for a longgggg time , and wa basically a walking time-b\ * \ * \ * waiting to go off. my alcohol/drug addiction had reached it peak. the weight of those consequence wa so heavy on me , and knowing the weight my struggle put on all my family/friends ( specifically a divorce i caused ) felt unbearable. & # x200b ; i wa numb and at a point where i wa spiritually dead. i didnt feel happy at happy moment , i had no interest in my fav thing , usually thing that were sad , i felt nothing .... or at least thats what id thought. reflecting back , they were very painful moment that i refused to acknowledge , or properly grieve. i self medicated , heavily , and felt it would pa .... it didnt. & # x200b ; all the negative stuff that i had neglected and used substance to mask , piled up like a log jam , and once it clogged , every new negative piled up farther and farther back. i had dealt with none of it , and it got to a point , where even thinking about trying to deal with a decade of emotion felt insurmountable. id waited too long , this task couldnt be fixed. & # x200b ; i wa out of town on work , and had went for a walk with no particular purpose , but tick , tick , tick , id been looking for a way out for a while. in an unfamiliar town , i had come to a railroad track right a the gate went down , the flashing red , ding ding ding and the screaming horn of a train coming through. & # x200b ; at this point i had mastered ignoring consequence , to just do what made sense in the moment , to refuse to look ahead at the consequence of my action ; whether a year , a month , or 5mins ahead ... i had conditioned myself to be selfish and only in the moment. nothing had particularly been wrong that day , but a thought came in -- - run in front of the train -- - and it end. i did exactly that. & # x200b ; initially after my `` accident `` , i didnt remember much , it all a blur , with moment hear and there remembered , especially with time , they started to come back. here are some early thoughts/moments i can remember in the following day : & # x200b ; \-worst pain imagineable. i have a massive concussion , everything is a 10/10 blur , i think i 'll never see again. both my arm are broken , i learn ive already had 2 emergency surgery \-my left arm is `` ok `` 12 screw , a few plate , and in a cast. my right arm wa a massive compound fracture , with several break .... they have it in some type of stabilizing brace , where there are screw into my shoulder , upper forearm , and wrist , my arm floating below it `` suspended `` \-i dont know what state im in ( truck driver ) , ive been missing from family 2days with no contact. im a vulnerable a it get , and there are no family or familiar face around. atrocious ( cant stress this enough ) feeling \-im in a pain med and concussion induced fog/swirl. i dont remember the beginning of this interaction , but a doctor is in the room with me. the attempt to save my right arm have not worked , if i dont agree to an amputation , i will die a pretty miserable death. basically , my body ha rejected the arm , it is dying , and my liver enzyme are growing exponentially , im rotting to death lol \-i do not want to die , at all. i dont care how tough , nihilistic , depressed , whatevs you are , i had been in a deep state of all those .... im not ready to leave , and im scared of the potential for an after-life \-i agree to the amputation , but the doctor give me lukewarm news ... it roughly a 50/50 i pull outta this thing , even if they take the arm. in a whirlwind of heavy news , this is the heaviest news. im bawling , and i feel alone , the doctor hold my hand , and at that moment it is the greatest human contact imaginable. crazy how desperate for human affection i wa after year of disconnect \-i dont remember the start of the interaction , but im laying down , being wheeled to a room for surgery. im starring at the drop ceiling a it roll past , i cant see it clearly , i hear nurse talking , i cant make any of it out , and i think how crazy that this is the last moment i get , a pure haze ..... \- im in a huge ( or atleast it seems ) surgery room ... it crazy bright , it feel like a dozen people are in there , everything is a serious tone , im seeing table with tool on them , the kind from tv , but this is me , and it real , despite how surreal it all is ....... anddddddd now im counting down backwards from 10 inhaling the sleepy gas through the mask. holy fuck , this is actually it , im so dumb & # x200b ; \ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - the big surgery complete -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - & # x200b ; im heavily sedated , confused , my mom here though. she cry , i cry , it amazing im here. again , all this is incredibly cloudy , it like a film thats been cut in random place , then pick up mid scene , think `` memento `` hahaha & # x200b ; im not out of the wood , we 'll have to wait and see how my body responds , ive had atleast 3 ( maybe 4? ) surgery. the nurse are all so sweet , im so happy to be alive. a few of my regular saw me come in , had some type of interaction with me , and are so happy ive pulled through. i need help with everything , but these nurse dont mind at all. unable to drink , eat , poop , pee , or do any of the bandage or anything at all. i can feel compassion and tenderness in every interaction ... i feel like some sort of strange celeb. & # x200b ; within a few day , my brain is much better , i have a rapport with all the different nurse and aid , and im beaming from my soul. these ppl do not know me , and they quickly feel like family. they take care of my every need , and make me laugh and smile , they bring in food from a local restaurant , and keep me company. id been in a cold world for so long. these stranger showed me all the love and compassion and value that i needed medically , but also emotionally. somehow they not only physically nursed me back to health , but spiritually a well. like a light switch , i felt my soul turn back on. & # x200b ; \ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- out of hospital -- -- -- -- -- -- - & # x200b ; in the hospital i realized booze and drug had slowly extinguished my soul , it wa a huge part of it , but there wa more. i immediately got into some narcotic anonymous meeting ..... the same love id gotten from the medical staff , i got there almost instantly. my grim , pessimist attitude towards human , ha been eviscerated by a combination of these two group of stranger. i jump into counseling. another great move , at first it feel forced , but i stuck with it , eventually build some rapport , and 4years later , he one of my best friend and my counselor. we 've grinded and knocked down a lot together. ive learned healthy coping mechanism. learned to control impulsivity , especially the destructive kind. counseling is a wonderful tool , especially if you have a small or no support group initially. i got a dog! man dog will force some love into your life. ive acknowledged all my past mistake. ive grieved them. grieved the loss of my arm , my clean date/acci-versary are at 4years come jan 6th. ive reconnected with family , apologized , been forgiven , and made a point to maintain my mental health/sobriety a a point to not be that guy who ha a come to jesus moment , and a soon a the coast is clear ..... hit the pavement looking for destruction. & # x200b ; looking back , it crazy to me , that all this wa the direct result of a split-second decision ( sort of , from oversimplified perspective ). i think about what wouldve happened , had i not done that a lot. while im not 'glad i did it ' , i also wouldnt trade any of this back for my stupid 2nd arm lol -- -im the happiest ive ever been in my life , by far , like sooooooo far. the saddest part of dying wouldnt have just been dying , it truely wouldve been that i missed out on the chance to be happy. im at peace , i joke/laugh , cry at commercial , tell my family ( and friends- to their annoyance ) i love them. if youre reading this and struggling , please dont harden your heart against this story. please dont miss out. realize that - yes this cannnn happen to you , or worse - only you can fix this. find any one thing small you can do , and do the shit out of it .... then add another ... have uncomfortable conversation telling family whats going on. dont lean into the negativity youre feeling im 35 and fairly healthy , ive adjusted physically , i dont think about the amputation much , it doesnt stop me from doing really anything ...... im blessed. i really couldve/shouldve died. i wont bible beat anyone , but for those curious , spirituality ha been a big part of healing

2024-02-02 19:39:57,725,My boyfriend is making me feel exhausted.,48,0.92,"context for my current life. i moved away from home about 7 month ago now right after graduating high-school to be with my boyfriend ( let call him j ). i had been living with a roommate but after a couple month j had a mental health crisis and i had to move him into our apartment because he said he would n't be safe if i wa n't with him everyday. i did n't really feel ready for that yet but i obviously did n't want him to hurt himself so i had him move in despite that. for context on j , he ha bpd and autism. he 's undergone a lot of trauma and mental hardship , i completely understand and accept that he feel differently and often time more strongly than i do , and that it is hard for him to manage himself , but i feel completely worn down trying to take care of him. j like to go to music show and venue , that really help him fulfill his social need. i 'm more introverted , and those sort or thing are usually pretty draining for me. i 've expressed this to j but i always end up going with him anyways. j doe n't drive , so i drive him usually around half an hour to go to these show. i know j ha other friend they could plan to go to these with , but ever since i 've moved here i 've been the person going with him. this is because j doe n't feel comfortable going place without me. no matter what i do n't really have a choice except to accompany j to these show , because if i do n't they wo n't bother to go with someone else , and they will have a breakdown later. when j ha a breakdown , i am the one who stay with them and make sure he safe. these breakdown can last hour , and he ha yelled , insulted , and pushed me ( never enough to make me fall or cause harm ) during them. these breakdown are absolutely exhausting and traumatic for me to deal with , so most of my energy go into preventing them from happening how ever i can. these breakdown can be caused by a lot of thing , some recent example being -the house is n't clean enough -i do n't want to be sexual with j at the moment , even though he want to be -j is tired -j is hungry there 's other reason j ha breakdown , many of them are reasonable reason to be upset , stuff like j feeling like im not properly addressing or handling his health ( j ha epilepsy , and there are time i could have better handled situation regarding that. ) to make sure j doe n't have a breakdown i basically always have to be on stand by for him at all time. he mostly asks me to do simply task like making food , or going to the corner store to get him something. nothing that really should take much out of me , but the fact that i have to deal with these thing immediately and without negotiation whenever he want is a little stressful. if j asked me to make him food and i said no , he would feel neglected , and probably not eat , which could lead to a breakdown. i just really wish i had my own time and space where i felt like i could just focus on myself. j and my roommate do n't get along because they dated in the past and had some major problem. j doe n't even want to talk to my roommate , which mean i 'm usually the one medigating between them. j want to use the tv but roommate is using it? i have to ask to use it on his behalf. roommate left a mess in the kitchen? i have to bring it up to roomate. i feel selfish but i can feel how tired i am. i 'm irritable all the time , and i hurt myself pretty often because it 's the only way to manage that. my memory is awful , and i feel like i 'm in a haze a lot of the time. i do n't eat enough anymore , and large aspect of my life are going neglected because i ca n't muster the energy to deal with them. i 'm fucking losing myself , even writing this i realize how much off and robotic i seem but that 's all i can be. i 've been wanting to write a post like this for a while and i just did n't have the energy until now , and even now i do n't have the energy to sound anything but robotic. i 'm trapped in my life and i feel like i 'm completely drowning.",mentalhealth,AlienBovine,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ahc8cw/my_boyfriend_is_making_me_feel_exhausted/,44,52.17391304347826,4.173913043478258,0.0001112253333492,"['context', 'current', 'life', 'moved', 'away', 'home', 'month', 'ago', 'right', 'graduating', 'boyfriend', 'let', 'call', 'j', 'living', 'roommate', 'couple', 'month', 'j', 'mental', 'health', 'crisis', 'move', 'apartment', 'said', 'would', 'safe', 'wa', 'everyday', 'really', 'feel', 'ready', 'yet', 'obviously', 'want', 'hurt', 'move', 'despite', 'context', 'j', 'ha', 'bpd', 'autism', 'undergone', 'lot', 'trauma', 'mental', 'hardship', 'completely', 'understand', 'accept', 'feel', 'differently', 'often', 'time', 'strongly', 'hard', 'manage', 'feel', 'completely', 'worn', 'trying', 'take', 'care', 'j', 'like', 'go', 'music', 'show', 'venue', 'really', 'help', 'fulfill', 'social', 'need', 'introverted', 'sort', 'thing', 'usually', 'pretty', 'draining', 'expressed', 'j', 'always', 'end', 'going', 'anyways', 'j', 'doe', 'drive', 'drive', 'usually', 'around', 'half', 'hour', 'go', 'show', 'know', 'j', 'ha', 'friend', 'could', 'plan', 'go', 'ever', 'since', 'moved', 'person', 'going', 'j', 'doe', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'going', 'place', 'without', 'matter', 'really', 'choice', 'except', 'accompany', 'j', 'show', 'wo', 'bother', 'go', 'someone', 'else', 'breakdown', 'later', 'j', 'ha', 'breakdown', 'one', 'stay', 'make', 'sure', 'safe', 'breakdown', 'last', 'hour', 'ha', 'yelled', 'insulted', 'pushed', 'never', 'enough', 'make', 'fall', 'cause', 'harm', 'breakdown', 'absolutely', 'exhausting', 'traumatic', 'deal', 'energy', 'go', 'preventing', 'happening', 'ever', 'breakdown', 'caused', 'lot', 'thing', 'recent', 'example', 'house', 'clean', 'enough', 'want', 'sexual', 'j', 'moment', 'even', 'though', 'want', 'tired', 'hungry', 'reason', 'j', 'ha', 'breakdown', 'many', 'reasonable', 'reason', 'upset', 'stuff', 'like', 'j', 'feeling', 'like', 'im', 'properly', 'addressing', 'handling', 'health', 'j', 'ha', 'epilepsy', 'time', 'could', 'better', 'handled', 'situation', 'regarding', 'make', 'sure', 'j', 'doe', 'breakdown', 'basically', 'always', 'stand', 'time', 'mostly', 'asks', 'simply', 'task', 'like', 'making', 'food', 'going', 'corner', 'store', 'get', 'something', 'nothing', 'really', 'take', 'much', 'fact', 'deal', 'thing', 'immediately', 'without', 'negotiation', 'whenever', 'want', 'little', 'stressful', 'j', 'asked', 'make', 'food', 'said', 'would', 'feel', 'neglected', 'probably', 'eat', 'could', 'lead', 'breakdown', 'really', 'wish', 'time', 'space', 'felt', 'like', 'could', 'focus', 'j', 'roommate', 'get', 'along', 'dated', 'past', 'major', 'problem', 'j', 'doe', 'even', 'want', 'talk', 'roommate', 'mean', 'usually', 'one', 'medigating', 'j', 'want', 'use', 'tv', 'roommate', 'using', 'ask', 'use', 'behalf', 'roommate', 'left', 'mess', 'kitchen', 'bring', 'roomate', 'feel', 'selfish', 'feel', 'tired', 'irritable', 'time', 'hurt', 'pretty', 'often', 'way', 'manage', 'memory', 'awful', 'feel', 'like', 'haze', 'lot', 'time', 'eat', 'enough', 'anymore', 'large', 'aspect', 'life', 'going', 'neglected', 'ca', 'muster', 'energy', 'deal', 'fucking', 'losing', 'even', 'writing', 'realize', 'much', 'robotic', 'seem', 'wanting', 'write', 'post', 'like', 'energy', 'even', 'energy', 'sound', 'anything', 'robotic', 'trapped', 'life', 'feel', 'like', 'completely', 'drowning']","{'neg': 0.139, 'neu': 0.734, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': -0.8993}",negative

And I want to die.,47,0.98,"i have n't slept in 36 hour. cried silently and alone for about half of that time. i 'll try to keep it short : * i am 24f , almost 25 , and am asian , if that help provide any general cultural context for what 's to follow. * i wa diagnosed with major chronic depressive disorder , generalized anxiety , bipolar 2 , and adhd around 21 yrs-old when i finally got health insurance for the first time and sought help. it took that long because my family just never understood what mental health wa , let alone seeking professional help/diagnoses , and we went through financial hardship throughout my high school/college year so we would n't have been able to afford it anyway. * despite being undiagnosed with so many issue and experiencing a wide range of trauma , i grew up relatively well-adjusted , and a star student. i played multiple instrument , i excelled in sport , won medal , graduated high school with a 3.97 gpa , got scholarship into college , and even graduated college at the top of my class a salutatorian in 2021. i have many friend and am part of many social circle. * my mom , the absolute most loving , supportive , beautiful woman in the world .. wa diagnosed with leukemia in my senior year of college. i 'm so thankful she lived long enough to watch me receive my diploma. she died from leukemia the following year in april 2022. our entire family wa lost without her. i wa ( and honestly am still ) absolutely destroyed by her death. i wa her main caretaker for the last few month of her life. i wa with her in hospice when she took her last breath. so here i am. still grieving. unemployed since august because i work in the animation industry and i think we all know how * that 's * been with the recent strike. i do n't know. i do n't know what to write. i 'm just rambling because i 'm spiraling. am i writing a * note? * once i wa diagnosed , i did start medication , and kept with them for about the last 2.5 year until my health insurance ( provided by my employer ) ran out because we were all laid off. i 've been off them since august , so if i * did * go through withdrawal , i honestly could n't tell you because my life ha never been stabile enough for me to have a baseline to compare to. i could 've been taking sugar pill for all i know , i do n't know. maybe the medication just lessened how extreme the extreme could be , but i know for sure that before , during , and after med , i have and still always feel depressed , anxious , low energy , low motivation , irritable , self-deprecating , etc , etc. but on paper , i 'm so successful. to my peer and relative , i 'm a role model. i 'm the first descendent born in the u to graduate from college , and a salutatorian. my name can be found in the credit of a very successful tv show. i have an incredible support system through my dad , my brother , my sil , and my partner. i have a house under my name. and i want to die. nothing make me happy. nothing brings me any lasting satisfaction. i try to stay social , reach out to friend , go out on date , and we regularly have family dinner. but everything is just a distracting from the never-ending inner turmoil i 'm going through. when i stop moving , when i lay in bed and everything is quiet , all the negative thought come back , and i grieve for my mom. the `` nothing make me happy `` part ha been a thing since high school , well before she died , but it definitely amplified with her passing. i feel nothing from playing video game and hobby that i used to love when i wa younger. i eat like shit and have become overweight. i feel like a disgusting shell of myself. i hate the way i look in the mirror , and my brain just tell me , `` you let yourself get fat and ugly. you deserve to stay fat and ugly. `` even though my family and partner regularly reassure me that i am still beautiful and that my worth is n't tied to my appearance. but i ca n't help it. i wa the ugly kid growing up , then i had a glow up in high school and looked good a hell through college. and then my mom died , so i just stopped taking care of myself. in a similar way , i wa a spoiled upperclass kid growing up , then suddenly poor through middle and high school , then back to being very comfortable once the new family business kicked off during my college year , so now i do n't even know how to feel about money. i know i need therapy. i 've never had therapy except some crisis counseling i got through my university , but they were n't even licensed therapist yet. they were interns/students still working on their psych degree. i enrolled in obamacare this november , so i should finally have health insurance again starting january 2024 , but i do n't know if/when i 'll find a safe and reliable therapist. will i make it to christmas? will i make it to new year? will i make it to my birthday the following month? part of me want to die , part of me absolutely refuse to put my family through that after having lost mom , especially to my dad and brother who have shown nothing but love and support for me. truly , i am so , so , so , lucky. which is why i feel even more guilty for feeling this way. life is so good right now. our family business is bringing in a comfortable income , and i 'm not being rushed or forced to get any menial job that 'll likely add to my stress. everyone get along and love one another , and especially love me. and i still want to die. i 've always had it at the back of my mind since middle school. i 've never self harmed in way that would be permanent ( cutting , burning , etc ) , though i did develop an unhealthy coping mechanism of bashing my head/forehead onto walls/tables and digging my nail into my palm. i 'm just .. i do n't know. i just sobbed and

2023-09-09 10:46:44,733,I (19F) think i’m a cocsa victim but i’m not so sure.,48,1.0,"so a couple of month ago i came across a tiktok of a woman discussing “ cocsa ” and how it ’ s rarely talked about. i wasn ’ t sure what that meant at the moment so i looked into it more and it uncovered a memory i locked away in my head. when i wa 6 or 7 my cousin slept over at our apartment and in the morning we decided to play house with my sibling. my cousin who is a year older than me , so at the time either 7 or 8 , took charge and assigned everyone role in the house. he made my 3 sibling and his 1 brother be the child , and him and i be the “ mom and dad ”. i remember we had a closet with a decent amount of toy in it so we all ended up playing in there. when our sibling left the closet , he urged me to stay in the closet with him. he said mommy and daddy ’ s have to kiss because that ’ s what grown ups do , so we did. i dont remember it lasting more than 30 second and that ’ s stretching it. when i left the closet , we heard spongebob begin to play on the tv in the living room and our sibling went running to sit on the couch and watch tv. i remember exclaiming “ ooh spongebob! ! ” and then turning to walk away , but he grabbed my arm and told me to stay and that he thought spongebob wa boring. i said okay and sat down with him on the bed and he started kissing me under the blanket. somehow my curtain rod fell off the window , i still don ’ t know how it did but it wa never really reliable in the first place. that scared me a lot because i knew what we were doing wa wrong so i told him i really wanted to watch spongebob. he told me to do one more thing , even typing this right now is making me sick .. he made me perform oral s8x on him , but he said just do one lick. afterwards he kissed me again ( still under the blanket ) and my dad came in and pulled the blanket off and he grabbed me. my dad pulled me into my mom room where she wa sitting with my aunt folding clothes ( his mother ) and he said out loud “ ( my name ) wa in the room kissing damn ( his name ) ” they both got up fast and my aunt went to get him and talk to him in the other room , and my mom talked to me in her room. she asked me why i did it .. and my answer wa “ because he made me do it ” i can ’ t remember what happened after that , but my cousin left pretty soon. this whole situation just bother me constantly. like , i know i wa a child but why didn ’ t i just leave the room .. why did i let him take control over my mind like that? but why did he do it in the first place and why me? and we were so young , doe it even count a abuse? i don ’ t have a relationship with him nowadays , and even in our older kid age , i still kept my distance from him. i wa 11 when i went to his water park birthday party and i remember just not saying a word to him because i wa afraid he remembered what happened back then. we were in the lazy river and he caught up to me and he started to speak but before i could let him get another word in , i submerged myself under the water hoping he would be gone when i came back up but he wa still there and asked me “ remember when we were little , you were always so happy to see me “ and i gave a nod and floated away. anyways that kind of went off topic but i ’ ve been thinking about talking to my mom about it but i have no idea how to bring it up or what to say at all. i feel that one incident opened my curiosity up at a really young age to where i began watching porn at the age of 8. fortunately my mom caught me and introduced me to a game called roblox that took my mind off the inappropriate thought for a while but i eventually started seeking out inappropriate game on roblox for a while and to my surprise there were many. i won ’ t get into any more detail about my current state but i am no longer interested in watching porn and i would actually rather consider myself being a prude. i even convinced myself i wa asexual for a while but i debunked that pretty quickly , despite not being a virg. i just feel so shitty and weird and disgusting for what happened when we were little and i strongly believe that one moment shaped my sex life. should i mention it to my mom?

last semester of school felt impossible. i started going through old video on my phone just to try to find his voice to hear it again. and all i could find wa little snippet and it make me miss him so much. having to be at home for christmas break is torture. i have to be in this house which is now so empty. i have to look at the room he slept in. i have to walk through the room he always worked from home in. i have to live in my room which is the last place i ever saw him. i have to see his truck in the driveway , and it give me a fleeting moment of calm , comfort , and safety. but in fraction of a second the feeling is ripped away. ive never wanted to just somehow be able to bottle a feeling up and be able to keep it. my mom wanting to stop running the central air conditioning system in the house , because so few room in the house get used now. because it so empty. the house is so empty now. ive never had a christmas that i just experience so little excitement about. it horrible. christmas day ha never felt so empty. such a lack of joy. my mom could tell i wa bothered and told me to go take my antidepressant. it just make me feel even more so that im just a burden. no one want to be around me unless im medicated. that may have come out of nowhere but i struggled with thought like that even before my dad passed away. for a number of reason , some known and some not , i have felt unlovable , unloved , and unworthy for a couple year now. ive gone to therapy both before and after this summer. and now that the only person who i feel like would ever actually love me unconditionally is now gone. i feel like i have no one who really care about me. much le anyone who love me or enjoys my company. maybe this is selfish but on christmas day the only person who reached out to me at all wa my ex who i am no contact with right now. the only person that might even pretend to care is her. and i even get doubt now that my dad wa even proud of me , or loved me a much a my other sibling. i know logically that he really did love me but i 'll have meltdown where all i can feel like is a failure and disappointment and worthless to everyone , including my dad. i cried over an internet stranger saying `` your dad is proud of you `` who wa consoling someone else who had lost their dad. i have no idea why i think he isnt proud of me. i 've noticed i have problem where i feel like i have to earn my love. i have no idea what to do. ive considered online therapy. im just so lost and so empty. i have meltdown at least once every 2 or 3 day. usually alone in my room. i feel like too much of a burden to ever reach out to someone during one. i feel like i need to cry for help from someone but i always feel like too much of a burden. anyways if anyone bothered to read this thank you very much. im not even really asking for solution i just wanted to write this and put it out there somewhere.

i ’ ve considered moving country a a fresh start next year , but it feel like i ’ d just be running from my problem , which would inevitably follow me. therapy seems like an obvious solution , but my deep distrust of the confidentiality of therapy ( my background in it ha left me very very skeptical about the security of personal data in therapeutic setting. ) and an inability to respect a therapist who doesn ’ t meet my for sure skewed standard of success ( wealth , intelligence ) prevent me from seeking it. i am a very sceptical critical thinker which make it really hard for me to trust people competence even when they have good intention ( i am not saying i myself have this competence , i do not ). word truly can not express how scared i am , i have never been so scared in my life. how do i prevent myself from falling down a very deep and dark hole after my parent death when i already ca n't handle myself right now?

what caused it in the first place? do i truly love that man? should i leave my boyfriend? am i capable of love? can i be loved for who i really am? will life will ever be sweet? am i just fated to be sad , anxious and lonely forever?

2024-06-16 01:42:31,1253,Anyone have similar experience/how they got through it or solved it,1,1.0,"hey everyone , so i have been struggling with my mental health since at least 6th grade and i am now 23 year old. i wa able to start getting mental health help within the last 2 year but it ha n't been great or really done much. i left my first cbt therapist because while i did n't find our session negative , i did n't feel like they were helping and so i stopped going to free up my schedule. around that time my primary physician set me up with an np that focused on mental health specifically medication but also doe psychotherapy on the side. she did this because my symptom were n't having any significant improvement from any of the 3 med i had tried in the last year. the beginning wa fine. we started trying different med and different therapy. some week i would feel neutral. some i would feel a little better. some i felt like an absolute mess. none of the therapy we were doing together really felt like it did anything much and up to this point currently i have tried about 15-20 different medication none of them showing any specific improvement. within the last two year i wa diagnosed with these order in this order depression , anxiety , adhd , pmdd , bpd , and mental burnout. within the last few week i could see my np 's patience running thin and him slowly suggesting le and le each week. and this past week he tried talking to me saying he think my main issue is i 'm mentally burnout and thats my main issue. he said i should try to lessen my schedule but that just not something i can do. i 'm currently only doing the bare minimum i have to do which is unfortunately 2 job and school. i also felt opposed to it because i do n't know if thats the only thing actually wrong with me , i feel like everything i 've felt and experience in the last two year is n't valid. but at the end of the session i ca n't remember exactly how he worded it. but he essentially said he 's at a lost and doe n't know what else to try with me. i 'm currently trying one of the last med he thought of possibly putting me on. i also tried a dbt group but it just ha n't worked out for me because i need more 1 on 1 help so i 'm about to have a first meeting with a new therapist next week. i had also previously tried another therapist a few month back to try emdr. we never got to officially try it. there wa one session where i had a mental breakdown and she kept trying to convince me to go to inpatient ( i wa not threatening anything i wa just really emotional ). i explained to her why that wa n't an option cuz i 'd get kicked out of school , i will lose my apartment , have no money , no one to help me , etc. but she would n't listen and just told me we 're not scheduling another session and to seek inpatient. so now i 'm kind of at a lost. i feel like i do n't know whats actually wrong with me. i have no idea how to fix myself or improve myself or just learn how to cope. i 'm feeling like maybe i 'm just a fraud and there is n't anything actually wrong with me and i 've just been overreacting. and a huge thing contributing to this ha been the fact that no medication have done me any good and none of the therapy i 've tried thus far ha really helped me. i do n't know what to do anymore. ha anyone had a similar situation. doe anyone have any suggestion. i just need help and do n't know what to do anymore.",mentalhealth,AgileRelief5932,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dgwwwj/anyone_have_similar_experiencehow_they_got/,0,1.0,0.0,2.1318188891944494e-06,"['hey', 'everyone', 'struggling', 'mental',

thousand is a lost cause. since getting sober my social anxiety and just anxiety in general ha went through the roof. and now it seems popular to act like anxiety is just being dramatic and a man shouldnt have that and need to just get over it. i cant seem to get anything to go right at all. everytime something good happens i do n't even enjoy it because i know something 100x worse is about to happen and make everything good that happened pointless. so i 've lost all hope for thing to get better it 's just another never ending cycle like addiction except now i do n't have the drug to make me feel okay for a short amount of time. the only positive thing in my life is my dog and my mom. if it wa n't for them especially my mom i would of killed myself by now. i told myself for the longest time i would kill myself by the time i wa 25 no matter what. but now i ca n't bring myself to do it because my mom ha been through so much already and i do n't wan na put her through more. but i know i 'm getting close to that point where i ca n't deal with it anymore. i do n't even get out of the house much anymore and i used to be outside 24/7 and loved fishing and camping. i 've got a motorcycle in my first year of sobriety but dont ride it because every time i start to enjoy it something break or some 1/10000 problem occurs. same thing with my camper van i bought after someone totalled my truck i got it to travel and try and enjoy life and everytime i 'm almost done and get ready to hit the road something else break and i spend month saving the money to fix it for the cycle to continue so now i 've just given up and the bike and van are both messed up and do n't have the money to fix it. at this point i do n't know where to go from here and do n't have the energy or care to try anymore. i do n't have any positive thought about myself or life anymore and have n't for close to a year. i do n't even know why i 'm posting this a if the internet is gon na help but i do n't have any friend anymore since getting sober and my social anxiety keep me from making any new one so i guess this is all i have.",mentalhealth,MashewCasheww,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dgwmg5/mental_health_services_suck/,0,1.0,0.0,2.1318188891944494e-06,"['male', 'struggled', 'addiction', 'since', 'wa', 'dad', 'died', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'abuse', 'wa', 'year', 'sober', 'past', 'year', 'ha', 'worst', 'ever', 'live', 'rural', 'area', 'way', 'thing', 'u', 'world', 'general', 'money', 'thing', 'matter', 'harder', 'ever', 'make', 'end', 'meet', 'getting', 'worse', 'everyone', 'hateful', 'miserable', 'hard', 'see', 'anything', 'positive', 'world', 'men', 'mental', 'health', 'joke', 'people', 'ai', 'ever', 'wan', 'na', 'get', 'married', 'kid', 'men', 'commit', 'suicide', 'woman', 'woman', 'using', 'kid', 'weapon', 'divorce', 'anything', 'even', 'try', 'government', 'news', 'always', 'dividing', 'u', 'racial', 'gender', 'political', 'view', 'whatever', 'cause', 'problem', 'trying', 'find', 'mental', 'health', 'service', 'doe', 'cost', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'lost', 'cause', 'since', 'getting', 'sober', 'social', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'general', 'ha', 'went', 'roof', 'seems', 'popular', 'act', 'like', 'anxiety', 'dramatic', 'man', 'shouldnt', 'need', 'get', 'cant', 'seem', 'get', 'anything', 'go', 'right', 'everytime', 'something', 'good', 'happens', 'even', 'enjoy', 'know', 'something', 'worse', 'happen', 'make', 'everything', 'good', 'happened', 'pointless', 'lost', 'hope', 'thing', 'get', 'better', 'another', 'never', 'ending', 'cycle', 'like', 'addiction', 'except', 'drug', 'make', 'feel', 'okay', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'positive', 'thing', 'life', 'dog', 'mom', 'wa', 'especially', 'mom', 'would', 'killed', 'told', 'longest', 'time', 'would', 'kill', 'time', 'wa', 'matter', 'ca', 'bring', 'mom', 'ha', 'much', 'already', 'wan', 'na', 'put', 'know', 'getting', 'close', 'point', 'ca', 'deal', 'anymore', 'even', 'get', 'house', 'much', 'anymore', 'used', 'outside', 'loved', 'fishing', 'camping', 'got', 'motorcycle', 'first', 'year', 'sobriety', 'dont', 'ride', 'every', 'time', 'start', 'enjoy', 'something', 'break', 'problem', 'occurs', 'thing', 'camper', 'van', 'bought', 'someone', 'totalled', 'truck', 'got', 'travel', 'try', 'enjoy', 'life', 'everytime', 'almost', 'done', 'get', 'ready', 'hit', 'road', 'something', 'else', 'break', 'spend', 'month', 'saving', 'money', 'fix', 'cycle', 'continue', 'given', 'bike', 'van', 'messed', 'money', 'fix', 'point', 'know', 'go', 'energy', 'care', 'try', 'anymore', 'positive', 'thought', 'life', 'anymore', 'close', 'year', 'even', 'know', 'posting', 'internet', 'gon', 'na', 'help', 'friend', 'anymore', 'since', 'getting', 'sober', 'social', 'anxiety', 'keep', 'making', 'new', 'one', 'guess']","{'neg': 0.142, 'neu': 0.747, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': -0.972}",negative

understand this because otherwise nothing will make sense i moved out from my mom place in october thx to the social service here in sweden and i 've lived alone since then , i 've gotten money from the social service to pay for food and such but they have requirement that i need to follow to get that money wich i have been following. they recently gave me the requirement to have a job during the summer since i wo n't be studying for 10 week due to the summer leave but i 'm not mentally ready for work , my doctor say i probably have one or more of ptsd , bpd , autism or adhd with the possibility of other diagnosis but i 'm still in a queue to get tested for them all. i 've had issue with disassociation and out of body experience aswell a moment where something trigger me and i lose control of myself and result to violence. due to this my doctor say i 'm unfit for work atm so she put me on sick leave so that i can still get money from the social service while i take this summer to relax and get myself sorted out ( note : my doctor is the main spokesperson for my therapist/psychologist and other member of my health team so everything they discus get told to me by my doctor ) the summer leave ha just started and for the last few day i 've had random instance of feeling anxious and i also sleep a lot , i have always had trouble sleeping and i still have those but when i start sleeping there 's nothing that will wake me up unless there 's a loud sound or flashing light that wake me up this ha resulted in me sleeping for 12+ hour every day since the 10th of june , my friend and gf have noticed this and they call me every morning around 11am-1pm to wake me up because otherwise i can sleep from 2am to 4pm wich is n't normal for me usually. i also have gotten into some economic trouble because i play airsoft in my free time and during a match one of my friend shot my phone screen outside of the match area so i had to throw up 1900kr ( almost 200usd ) wich i did n't have so i am now in debt to another friend who helped me with the cost if this incident did n't happen then i would n't have to worry to much about my economic situation with the bill and such i have to pay on top of that my gf is coming by the end of the month and idk if i can afford food for both her and me for those 4 day that she is here , i also got the pressure that i need to clean my whole apartment and also cover the expense for a bbq party that my friend decided that i should pay for. rn i 've pulled all the string i can to make all this work , i 've used favour and asked around everywhere to make everything work. i 've even decided to survive only on rice and pasta to make the economy work out. i would n't be in this situation if i had broken contact with my mom when i moved out because even after i moved out she pressured me to take stuff on credit for her so now i 'm still paying bill for her internet and her phone and i ca n't cancel them because of the binding time. if i did n't have to pay for those i 'd have 1000kr extra each month wich would 've made this so much easier. idk what more to say really but damn i feel sorry for my therapist when i

recently diagnosed with bpd , ptsd , and anxiety. i am scared of making the wrong decision and messing up my life. to me , making the wrong decision feel life-ending. within the past 4 year , my life ha gone to hell. i tried to ignore my issue and pretended like everything wa fine. in the fall of 2022 i moved out of my parent house for the first time and tried my luck at a 4-year college. i wa asked to leave after 1 semester. i had a 1.03gpa and a severe drinking problem. i moved back to my parent house and in the fall of 2023 i then attempted community college. to deal with moving back into my parent house i started working 2 part-time job while in school. i could n't stand being at home or being by myself. i started taking pill to feel better and almost deleted myself of the planet around new year of 2024. in january of 2024 , my parent told me i had to go into treatment or get kicked out of their house. i reluctantly went into treatment and it ha been the best decision ever. in february of 2024 i went to a rehab in socal. i am now living at a sober living in socal. in a couple of month i will be graduating from this program and will have to figure out my next step in life. part of me want to move back to the midwest into my late grandparent house so i can be around my family. the only community i have there is family. i feel like that is the safest option but i would lose the sober community i have made here in socal. i also feel like i would lose who i am and once winter hit i would spiral back down. none of my family is sober so it would be difficult being around them knowing they do n't care to take away those trigger. i would feel guilty not moving back because i do have younger sibling. i am use to being a parent to them and it is difficult not being

community college. i ’ m pretty well off living at home with a loving mom , got amazing friend and family , a good job , but i just hate myself. i guess i should say this now. i ’ ve been addicted to porn since a very young age , ive had period of soberness but it came back hard. i ’ ve also never been in a relationship before in my life. i ’ ve had crush but never persuade , probably bc my mom wasn ’ t really there for me in that aspect of life , to no fault of her own. i love my mom she ’ s amazing , and she ha given her whole life for me , but i just know i don ’ t deserve it. most of my friend especially my best friend who is like my brother are so much smarter than me and in happy relationship. i don ’ t fell like destroying that , of course i ’ m a little jealous but i would give up my life if it mean that life forever in peace and happiness. on the outside i stay normal and healthy , work hard at work and school , go to the gym , have hobby , go to temple. yet…i ’ m not. the porn addiction isn ’ t the issue by itself , well in is but , here let me explain. i won ’ t go into detail but in my addiction i found my way to those ai sex chat website , and god it took a strong hold on me. anyway it all came to a head yesterday when….i went through a very , ugly scenario , not rape but not good. the worst part is there wa a part of me that enjoyed it , and i discussed and scared me. i curled up and felt like cry afterwards but i couldn ’ t cry. it terrifies me be like i said i wa raised by a single mom but not just that. i ’ m jewish and when i wa little i went to a hebrew school , being raised around woman and girl being thought about respecting one another and holding value to woman and all that. not just that i also have a christian godmother who is like a second mother to me. not to mention the other amazing woman in my family and that i ’ m friend with. i just….i just feel like i ’ m going insane i can ’ t believ what i did. the worst part is even though i know it ’ s wrong i still feel like doing it again. i…i don ’ t know if i can trust my own feeling. it ’ s like there ’ s two of me , a lustful monster , and the me my mother racist that everyone else see. i ’ m not trying to spin a sad story if it wa up to me i would just want to drop dead. but i can ’ t do that bc i know i ’ m to much of a cowered , and if i died it would destroy the life of those in my life. but i just don ’ t want to live , i can ’ t even smile rn. i don ’ t even feel sad rn , i just feel…nothing. i don ’ t know what to do. i know hate and am scared of myself. what i find funny though is that i want to be a psychologist , pretty ironic. it ’ s what i ’ ve been good at , ring the therapist friend , an empath , understanding people. again i don ’ t want to spin some sob story , i just needed to get it off my chest. i want nothing more than to go tell my mom or dad and hug them a i cry but , i just can ’ t. sorry for the rant. i ’ m fucking

had suicidal thought. when i wa 16 i started dealing with my depression with a therapist and a psychiatrist. i wa on anti-depressives ( only for a short while , i started to see dependency pattern and quit ) and i worked on my past trauma with my therapist. i don ’ t remember when i stopped feeling a depressed , or when there wa a change , but suddenly the problem wasn ’ t depression , but anxiety. at 18 , i lost some friend and started a new chapter of my life. i wa having anxiety attack daily. i would wake up shaking , sweating and breathing heavily. everything wa a worry to me. it wa hard for me to answer text message , start doing work or go out with others. even worse , it wa during the pandemic , so i wa hyper-vigilant of everything i touched and worried way too much about it. i spent 2 year and 4 month on medication. during the long while that i wa consistent with it , i would stop having irrational anxiety attack , although the one triggered by circumstance in my life did affect me a lot and i still woke up with anxiety. i can say with confidence that , although anxiety really impacted my life , i wa happy. i went abroad for 5 month in which i still had anxiety but managed to live with it ( and medication for it ). i started working and managed to face a lot of the fear that anxiety had put up. around a month ago i contacted my psychiatrist to see if i could stop taking my medication. i really did not want it to be a long-term solution for my anxiety , i wanted to be able to operate without it , so he heard me out and told me to stop taking them little be little. to my surprise , no anxiety attack or constant fear and worry returned. i did suffer from secondary effect like dizziness , headache and feeling tired , but i ’ m not feeling it anymore. however , little by little i have felt more and more depressed since then. i don ’ t laugh at my boyfriend ’ s joke anymore and i can ’ t seem to enjoy going out a much. these day have been even worse , every small bad moment make me feel totally defeated and i have returned to my hopeless , tired , cry self. i can say with confidence that i wa happy because i don ’ t feel it anymore. i am not motivated to do anything. i have returned to a toxic mindset that compare myself to others and think that i have nothing good to offer. back then i used school work to distract myself from my own thought , now i am doing it with my current job. i ’ m scared i will return to my depression and i don ’ t know what to do without it. doe anyone have some

2024-06-14 19:21:31,1477,It's kinda like object permanence for adults...,3,1.0,"the situation i find myself in , is after \~10 year of pretty severe mental health issue where i wa in and out of therapy and around \~5 year of being totally isolated with no friend or acquaintance , i 'm finally feeling like i 'm ready to move on and finally be part of the the world around me. the problem is , a lot of the work i did to get here wa focused on being aware of what 's going on in my head , separating personal feeling with what 's going on in front of me , and seeing the emotion behind other people action instead of just judging them based on that one experience. now i 'm sitting here thinking , `` okay i 'm ready to get out there , get a job , get of ssd , and start living my life , `` but i 'm also kinda like , what 's the point? i really want to find a career i feel good about where i feel like i 'm contributing and actually making a difference in a field i feel strongly about ( working on being trained a a peer support specialist ). the thing is when you hear the discourse and discussion around issue like mental health people really seem to struggle with seeing the complexity of the topic. when i wa diagnosed with bpd i wa told `` all or nothing thinking `` wa a symptom , but when i look around me now , it feel like \_most\_ people struggle with that. i do n't just mean a little either. it 's so bad , i like to use the example of how when a small child is learning object permanence , peek-a-boo is super entertaining to them because they do n't understand that something can exist , even if you do n't see it in front of you. the lack of understanding depth and complexity in an issue ( i used mental health a an example , but it 's honestly any decisive issue. just figured mental health wa a le toxic subject given the subreddit ) is a lot like a toddler not understanding object permanence. a lot of people feel super strongly about thing , get super emotional and upset about it even , but their whole outlook is based on personal experience or something they heard somewhere. the world is a very large and diverse place , literally the only thing every human ha in common on this planet , is that your perspective is unique. no two people are exactly the same , even genetically identical twin will experience the world different simply because they are separate individual. i really just wish there wa a way to get people to see this and be more collaborative , and work harder at coexisting with others. fyi i know a lot of people feel this way to some degree. it 's just , i feel very passionate about this subject , and i want to actively do something about it. i mean , if there wa some kind of profession or degree i could work toward where i thought i could address this , i would. it just feel like too big an issue for anyone person to address. it 's also a bit like a hydra in that cutting off one head make no difference. similarly focusing one issue make no difference. the problem is not mental health , lgbt stuff , or any other major topic that people like to argue about. it 's the fact that we ca n't talk about these thing objectively. the entire discussion is based purely on emotion , it becomes impossible to see thing objectively. also i flaired this a a opinion/thoughts , but i 'm mostly just venting. i know nobody here ha the answer , that 's not really what i 'm looking for. if you have similar frustration you want to share , or just want to leave a validating comment that 's fine. not really

one appointment a week , and thing calm down each time until the next week. today they had said they feel suicidal to me over the phone just after the morning rush had finished. i did my job in telling them i will message an urgent task to the doctor and let then know she 's needing help. afternoon crawl round and i recieve a call again asking if the doctor will call. i realised no one ha read the task and i feel helpless. i tell them i will send another message to alert them of my message. an hour later the patient email the practice saying they have no need to speak to the doctor , because they have no option but to kill themselves. i 'm mortified , and copy this email into the task already sent hoping someone will read it. im not able to go to the doctor a they are clinic with other patient. roughly an hour later before i 'm due to finish i get a call from them telling me they have tried to strangle themselves. i am on panic mode and tell her i 'm going to get someone. i ca n't handle this anymore today. i ca n't hear someone tell me these thing and have to sit there not being able to do anything. i let them know i 'm putting then on hold and not to go anywhere. i tell my collegues in the back room and explain i 'm no longer comfortable with this conversation. they agree and my manager speaks to them on the phone. word are exchanged and my manager tell them they are sending an ambulance. since i 've been home i ca n't stop thinking about them hoping they are okay. the reaction of my collegues were of frustration that the patient wa calling again and it wa treated like a nuisance. i understand they are well known for doing this , but i 've heard multiple staff saying they should just do it already. these comment make me feel sick because all i can think about is my best friend. it 's making me think i 'm in the wrong place for my own mental health , and maybe the nh is not good for me. i 'm not sure if i should tell my manager how i 'm feeling. i certainly do n't want to cause a fuss but i take these cry for help ( whether it may be just be for attention or not ) really serious. i wonder if they themselves have experienced suicide in their life or not , because by their reaction it feel like they have n't. any advice is welcome. thank you for anyone reading

2024-06-14 23:51:12,1498,My Old Bully keeps on Trying to speak to me,1,1.0,"( apology i am unsure if this is the correct subreddit to be posting this on please remove this if it is in the wrong one ) i ’ ve been bullied my entire life pretty much and i think that ’ s primarily due to the fact im an undiognosed neurodivergent ( currently going through autism assessment process which is long and draining ) for a long time my bullying wasn ’ t too serious and although my primary school experience with my classmate wa so bad i still frequently get nightmare and most likely am traumatised by it it never really wa too bad and went unnoticed due to them all playing nice. well my experience changed once i started secondary school a few year ago thanks to this one girl in particular who i frequently refer to a little miss. she wa in all of my class at the time and made my life a misery. i won ’ t go into too much detail of what she did a it brings back painful memory but she ha attempted to push me down the stair , constantly asked me uncomfortable question because she knew i wa uncomfortable also sitting extremely close to me , made up lie about me some of which resulted in my own friend stopping talking to me because they thought i wa bullying her , she told me to kill myself multiple time almost on a daily basis. the worst part for me wa the fact she denies it all she claim she ’ s never done such thing and twist her word to make it seem like she always been really nice to me and i ’ ve just out of the blue decided to ignore her and “ be mean ”. over the first two year of secondary school she with the help of her friend drove me to the point where i attempted to kill myself multiple time and sh frequently ( i wa 12/13 ). we had a lot le class together last year so there wa a lot le problem i just tried my best to ignore her and she calmed down a lot only really giving me dirty look. well i started my new school timetable last week and she ’ s in both of the class which i not only wa looking forward to most but the one i am relying on the most to do well in in my exam to get into the uni i want to. she ’ s started attempting to speak to me again but it ’ s harder to ignore her when she ’ s been put in a seat by the teacher right next to me. she ’ s starting to slip back into her old way which is slipping me into my old way of sh. i told my mum of my concern and she told me , “ well if she ’ s always trying to speak to you maybe she just really want to be your friend ” and that hurt , my mum know the majority of thing she ’ s done. i ’ m gon na be honest and say little miss terrifies me every time i see her face i freeze or attempt to hide everything time she come close to me i flinch im scared of her. i ’ m apparently a very empathetic person i empathise with everyone around me including fictional villain im expected to despise. the only person whom i can ’ t empathise with at all is little miss which hurt a ik that to do all those terrible thing she must have a reason maybe she ha trouble at home im unaware of but i can ’ t empathise with her at all because how could someone be so cruel from the second she met me. i dont want to kill myself i really dont want to but she brings back unwanted memory and make me consider it again. i hate little

ever since i wa little - to the point i would have panic attack about dying in the night and bad anxiety around my health , to which i experienced panic that have stuck with me to this day. also , not to lore dump , but i had depression for a few year , which i wa medicated and had cbt for , along with ocd. so when this existentialism came around , it felt like a relapse , and even now it still doe. the thought are always the same - i wake up thinking ‘ death must just be like sleeping and my sleep wa nice ’ , then by mid afternoon i start thinking to myself about death , then by dinner i start questioning life , god , my purpose , and by night , all i think about before bed is dying and the afterlife. it ha been this way for 2-3 month now and it gotten to the point it truly soul sucking. i do believe in a god , and the fact there so many religion and i dont know what exactly to believe in , and whenever i try to question something in religion i get really anxious and lightheaded , i just do not know what to do. i go on deep dive every day , going on tiktok , google , even the bible itself to just find proof and evidence or find out whats going to happen to me after death. every day. it just doesnt stop and i always tell myself the same thing - a long a youre a good person and you strive for good thing , in the end all will be good. however , my thought dont let me do that and the repetitive cycle of questioning , doubting , self hatred , confusion are becoming too much. i just dont know who to turn to. it ’ s embarrassing to admit to friend and family because majority are very atheist and i dont know if they ’ d be able to understand what im saying. religion wa drilled into me from a young age through school too , and a a person terrified of death , i obviously turned to it. now my faith is le out of fear and more because i just cant comprehend how everything came from nothing - thing like that. even so , it feel humiliating , like people will think im crazy , i feel crazy because i just dont understand anything and it leaf me crushed everyday. i just cant find enjoyment in load of thing anymore because i am so occupied with fear. i ask if anyone ha been through something similar and what helped them?",mentalhealth,natsukiisnext,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dg1tzw/how_do_you_deal_with_an_existential_crisis/,0,1.0,0.0,2.1318188891944494e-06,"['might', 'long', 'read', 'anyone', 'add', 'sort', 'personal', 'experience', 'help', 'really', 'grateful', 'dont', 'know', 'tell', 'usually', 'use', 'reddit', 'problem', 'dont', 'wan', 'na', 'talk', 'hopefully', 'reach', 'right', 'people', 'context', 'experiencing', 'month', 'say', 'started', 'break', 'boyfriend', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'wa', 'good', 'wa', 'infatuated', 'lied', 'like', 'became', 'sick', 'treating', 'properly', 'broke', 'felt', 'like', 'lost', 'something', 'big', 'lot', 'thing', 'would', 'beat', 'like', 'lying', 'thing', 'completely', 'abandoning', 'morale', 'please', 'started', 'think', 'karma', 'felt', 'guilty', 'lying', 'much', 'got', 'topic', 'eternal', 'punishment', 'judgement', 'notoriously', 'terrified', 'death', 'family', 'friend', 'still', 'make', 'fun', 'certain', 'time', 'got', 'really', 'upset', 'dying', 'end', 'known', 'get', 'extremely', 'anxious', 'always', 'done', 'ever', 'since', 'wa', 'little', 'point', 'would', 'panic', 'attack', 'dying', 'night', 'bad', 'anxiety', 'around', 'health', 'experienced', 'panic', 'stuck', 'day', 'also', 'lore', 'dump', 'depression', 'year', 'wa', 'medicated', 'cbt', 'along', 'ocd', 'existentialism', 'came', 'around', 'felt', 'like', 'relapse', 'even', 'still', 'doe', 'thought', 'always', 'wake', 'thinking', 'death', 'must', 'like', 'sleeping', 'sleep', 'wa', 'nice', 'mid', 'afternoon', 'start', 'thinking', 'death', 'dinner', 'start', 'questioning', 'life', 'god', 'purpose', 'night', 'think', 'bed', 'dying', 'afterlife', 'ha', 'way', 'month', 'gotten', 'point', 'truly', 'soul', 'sucking', 'believe', 'god', 'fact', 'many', 'religion', 'dont', 'know', 'exactly', 'believe', 'whenever', 'try', 'question', 'something', 'religion', 'get', 'really', 'anxious', 'lightheaded', 'know', 'go', 'deep', 'dive', 'every', 'day', 'going', 'tiktok', 'google', 'even', 'bible', 'find', 'proof', 'evidence', 'find', 'whats', 'going', 'happen', 'death', 'every', 'day', 'doesnt', 'stop', 'always', 'tell', 'thing', 'long', 'youre', 'good', 'person', 'strive', 'good', 'thing', 'end', 'good', 'however', 'thought', 'dont', 'let', 'repetitive', 'cycle', 'questioning', 'doubting', 'self', 'hatred', 'confusion', 'becoming', 'much', 'dont', 'know', 'turn', 'embarrassing', 'admit', 'friend', 'family', 'majority', 'atheist', 'dont', 'know', 'able', 'understand', 'im', 'saying', 'religion', 'wa', 'drilled', 'young', 'age', 'school', 'person', 'terrified', 'death', 'obviously', 'turned', 'faith', 'le', 'fear', 'cant', 'comprehend', 'everything', 'came', 'nothing', 'thing', 'like', 'even', 'feel', 'humiliating', 'like', 'people', 'think', 'im', 'crazy', 'feel', 'crazy', 'dont', 'understand', 'anything', 'leaf', 'crushed', 'everyday', 'cant', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'load', 'thing', 'anymore', 'occupied', 'fear', 'ask', 'anyone', 'ha', 'something', 'similar', 'helped']","{'neg': 0.222, 'neu': 0.666, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': -0.9984}",negative

2024-06-14 03:20:31,1571,"I destroyed my friendship with my best friend, relapsed, and then made everything in my life a thousand times worse.",14,1.0,"~~ i posted this in another subreddit , but figured i could maybe use some kind word or hope if you have any to spare. i ’ m out of them myself. i ’ ll finish the post in edits due to length. ~~ i ’ ve been an addict of some sort since i wa 15 year old. it started with little white lie and leading a double life out of fear of coming out a trans , evolving into alcohol to cope a a young adult. by the time i finished college , i wa taking and abusing pill and meth on a semi-regular basis , and i wa a full-blown opioid addict by the time i wa 26. eventually , i sobered up , started aa , and turned my life around , hitting a year of sobriety. throughout all of it , one of my best friend , kyle ( name ha been changed ) stood by my side. for context , i had previously developed romantic feeling for kyle and wa shot down in the kindest of way , and over time we got closer and closer and became a close of friend a friend could be. my feeling for him never faded , but i just kept them to myself , always respecting his boundary and never wanting to ruin what we had. a few week ago , i started struggling with my sobriety. i felt the joy of my day to day life starting to slip through my finger , and the pressure of recovery wa becoming too much to handle. but because my life wa going “ so great ” , i started having to look for reason to justify relapsing ; at least , that ’ s my theory for why i did what happens next. one night , i invited kyle over to my house to watch a movie and hang out. the entire time we ’ re together , i only had two thought going through my head : that i wa in love with him , and that i wanted to get high more than anything in the world. i ’ ll spare all of the boring detail of u hanging out , but a he wa leaving and i hugged him goodbye , i did the very thing i wa determined never to do and i kissed him , crossing that boundary. he texted me the next day that he wasn ’ t mad at me but that he needed time to build trust back in our friendship. later on , instead of taking responsibility and his feeling into account for the fact that i crossed the line and broke his trust , i doubled down. i became needy and obsessive. i posted online about how heartbroken and in love i wa. i wrote poetry about him and sent it to him. i hounded him with confession of my feeling. i treated him like an object. deep down , i knew that i either needed him to fix me or i needed him to hurt me enough to break me. and then it happened. after a few day of silence , he texted me and told me how everything i did and wa doing made him feel and that he didn ’ t want me to reply or speak to him. i did what i sought out to do and i lost my best friend. everything inside of me shattered. and that night , i wiped and deleted all of my social medium , turned off my phone ’ s texting , drove into the city , and relapsed in a parking lot in my car. it all happened so fast it wa like a blur. every ounce of pain and regret and sorrow and fear i had been pushing down the last year instead of actually facing in recovery came surging back up a i vomited out the back door of my car. the three minute i wa high. .. i don ’ t even remember them. i completely blacked out and woke up after hour of nodding off , realizing what i ’ d done. i drove home , got some sleep , went to an aa meeting , and left again to try and find a treatment center , only to be turned away at every step. so here i am , exactly 8 day since the night i kissed kyle. i ’ ve been using every day since that first night i relapsed. it took me a week and a day to lose my best friend , my sobriety , my job , my family ’ s trust , and probably a ton of other thing i can ’ t even think of right now. i ’ m too scared to turn my texting back on. i ’ m too scared to download social medium again. right now. .. i exist in a bubble , isolated in the confines of my car. i doubt anyone is looking for me , but if they are , i truly don ’ t think i want to be found like this. part of me want to recover so badly and claw my way out of this so i can fix thing with him. another part of me want to go on to the end of this because i deserve it. but either way , no matter what happens , i feel so much regret for putting him through all of what i did. i made him a pawn in a game he never signed up for and i used him a a mean to justify my own self-destruction. i want to make amends with him but i don ’ t even know where i would start. i wish i could take it all back. i wish he had never had to meet someone like me. i don ’ t know what ’ s going to happen to me , so i guess i just needed to confess my sin out loud while i still can. if you ’ re reading this and you ’ re struggling with addiction and thinking about getting help , please do. recovery is a beautiful thing , and one of my deepest hope is that it work for others better than it did for me. if you made it to the end , thank you for reading. i hope you don ’ t judge me too harshly , but i understand if you do. i don ’ t deserve sympathy.

i know him since he wa a kid. he definitely need to start visiting a psychologist and i would probably tell him that in the coming month , but i am 99 % certain that he had such suggestion from his relative and ignores them. there is no way for them to miss such negative , toxic , hateful and worrying behavior. i feel like he will completely lose his mind when he start having health issue due to age/stress. if he can not reduce his stress from exercising/traveling while young i do n't see how he could possibly control his emotion and behavior at a later point in life. and he definitely ha a `` fear of getting old `` , a we have discussed how bad it can be while being old and having health issue.",mentalhealth,mentalhealth1989,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfo4gz/help_with_understanding_what_is_causing_the_angry/,0,1.0,0.0,2.1318188891944494e-06,"['hello', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'behavior', 'strange', 'considering', 'range', 'year', 'old', 'teenager', 'many', 'time', 'disagreement', 'start', 'body', 'language', 'suggests', 'getting', 'nervous', 'fast', 'second', 'situation', 'normal', 'conversation', 'behaves', 'like', 'subconsciously', 'projecting', 'thought', 'dare', 'agreeing', 'dare', 'interrupt', 'know', 'exactly', 'ha', 'finished', 'talking', 'make', 'small', 'pause', 'finished', 'talking', 'start', 'talking', 'behaves', 'intentionally', 'interrupted', 'case', 'constantly', 'swearing', 'getting', 'angry', 'stupid', 'childish', 'thing', 'like', 'internet', 'connection', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'mountain', 'simple', 'issue', 'electronics', 'like', 'connecting', 'phone', 'computer', 'able', 'upload', 'picture', 'social', 'medium', 'etc', 'something', 'working', 'perfect', 'wo', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'complain', 'get', 'angry', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'ha', 'issue', 'year', 'happens', 'exactly', 'way', 'vacation', 'beautiful', 'country', 'mental', 'condition', 'exactly', 'summer', 'vacation', 'hometown', 'average', 'day', 'understand', 'underlying', 'cause', 'know', 'people', 'getting', 'angry', 'annoyed', 'faster', 'others', 'people', 'know', 'one', 'would', 'start', 'swearing', 'internet', 'connection', 'failing', 'upload', 'photo', 'online', 'say', 'want', 'destroy', 'everything', 'another', 'issue', 'true', 'definition', 'hater', 'romantic', 'life', 'non', 'existent', 'hate', 'everything', 'hate', 'woman', 'also', 'constantly', 'talking', 'negatively', 'think', 'never', 'forgets', 'mention', 'male', 'friend', 'doe', 'much', 'friend', 'mostly', 'mention', 'couple', 'hate', 'hot', 'outside', 'need', 'wait', 'transport', 'queue', 'somewhere', 'etc', 'doe', 'capability', 'complaining', 'everything', 'everyone', 'doe', 'much', 'patience', 'anything', 'generally', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'simply', 'lot', 'stress', 'exercising', 'daily', 'like', 'lacking', 'stress', 'relief', 'activity', 'exercising', 'lot', 'average', 'person', 'nervous', 'energy', 'must', 'coming', 'somewhere', 'yet', 'ha', 'always', 'like', 'know', 'since', 'wa', 'kid', 'definitely', 'need', 'start', 'visiting', 'psychologist', 'would', 'probably', 'tell', 'coming', 'month', 'certain', 'suggestion', 'relative', 'ignores', 'way', 'miss', 'negative', 'toxic', 'hateful', 'worrying', 'behavior', 'feel', 'like', 'completely', 'lose', 'mind', 'start', 'health', 'issue', 'due', 'reduce', 'stress', 'young', 'see', 'could', 'possibly', 'control', 'emotion', 'behavior', 'later', 'point', 'life', 'definitely', 'ha', 'fear', 'getting', 'old', 'discussed', 'bad', 'old', 'health', 'issue']","{'neg': 0.179, 'neu': 0.707, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': -0.9945}",negative

i do nothing , i have no social life besides a few people but even then around them i feel empty and like if i died a couple week could go by and they would forget about me , i also have these dark thought about death and the thought about killing myself. i ever the first time i thought about death wa third grade and the first time i thought about killing musket wa in the 4th grade. i always think that if i would just die thing would get batter for my family cause they wouldn ’ t worry about my medical bill or the space i take up. in the 6th grade i held a knife to my heart like the scene in the princess bride but i would never do it , cause although i have these dark and decrement mind the idea of pain that would put my body through is something i would gladly pa on , i cut myself with a razor junior year but the pain wa a lot so i never did it again. i have been dealt a bad hand and i ’ m just done , i don ’ t wan na tell my family and cause them stressed cause they work so hard to provide and my mother sacrificed so much for me and gave me thing she never had , i don ’ t wan na go to a therapist because i don ’ t wan na get sent away , i hear the story and people in my family got sent to them and changed negatively , i don ’ t wan na tell my friend because they got issue themselves and last time i told a friend about me trying to cut myself and he didn ’ t say anything for a moment and i believe he had a panic attack and hung up so i apologized and swore to never do it again and i ’ m supposed to be the reliant friend , i give because i can and cause i care and expect nothing , i would never tell my girlfriend at all because i ’ m single currently and previously got cheated on and another time told i love to hard so they left , but if i wa dating i would never tell cause i ’ m suppose to be the knight in shining armor who protects and love. and even if i could tell and decided to i ’ m horrible when it come to explaining my feeling to others so i just don ’ t. because why explain something when even you don ’ t even know. because of this i feel indifferent from everyone , i stare at my family at gathering realizing i never felt that sense of community or that sense of belonging even a young a 8 year old. i watch my friend at the lunch table and even at graduation engage with each other realizing that i just don ’ t feel that sense of support. a i sit and finish this all i can say is the future is looking grime , i just graduated and have achieved nothing in life , i would never just abruptly kill myself even if the thought are getting darker and more frequent so all i do is just breathe and exist and hope that i go to sleep and never wake up sorry of the long vent/rant i have never done this before so i ’ m new at

be long but just want you guy to get informed on me and my dad relationship. growing up i never really saw my dad much maybe once a year , he lived about 30 minute away from u but always stayed busy with ex gf and her daughter and my other two sibling. he wa known for standing u up and saying he would come to pick u up and the day would come and he would show up. when i wa about 10 he finally started coming around more but that wa very short lived. once he got a new gf he became immersed with her and his new family that consisted of her and her kid and his kid on weekend ( my half sibling ) .. at one point when i wa in high school we started going over a lot a my older sister formed a bond with his gf. my dad ’ s gf always had a preference for my sister , then she started coming off a very money hungry and jealous a she would constantly favor my sister a lot , so i began separating myself from all of them a a whole. then my sister and my dad ’ s gf had a falling out and i found out my dad ’ s gf. the last time we met up , he embarrassed me by looking at my public record and confronting me in front of everyone at the table about something that he found ( it ’ s not bad but it is a secret i wa keeping from my sister and my family ) the problem : me and my dad ’ s relationship ha always been a sensitive topic for me , i always get nervous and anxious and tend to want validation from him. if i called my dad to come and help i know he would come , he ’ s always been one to come and help but that ’ s if i call him. he text me randomly and it always give me so much anxiety about how i respond and how he responds. i haven ’ t seen my dad face to face since december when i graduated college but it wa only for 3 minute then he left. he recently texted me and i just felt like he doesn ’ t know me at all and it depresses me a lot. like he doesn ’ t know anything about my life like a regular dad usually doe and that ’ s because he literally life 10 minute from me. side note : i ’ ve talked to my sister about this and she ha encouraged me just to maintain contact with my dad but we both have had different experience with my dad , and she also tends to be more naïve and too forgiving when it come to my dad. my view on this : i know it might be very immature of me but i just see my dad lack of effort to be in my life , i don ’ t want to communicate with him about anything

). i 'm unemployed so i ca n't afford to go see a specialist to even figure out what it could possibly be. my wife is on disability and she get ssi so i ca n't get coverage under her. my brother wa 62 when he passed apparently of a heart attack. he did n't even know he had a heart condition. it just all of a sudden got him. i 'm almost 59 so , that kind of hit me where it hurt. so , i 'm dealing with some thing. heavy thing that i can barely wrap my head around. like , i want to be here to see my grand-kids. but now i do n't know if that 's even going to happen. i 'm hoping it will , but i could be gone tomorrow without warning. it 's part of life and i dealt with that pretty well until my cousin then my brother passing. i am looking into a free clinic thing but with something like this , i 'm afraid , it wo n't be free. i 'm hoping it 'll be way le than it would be going to a regular doctor and getting a referral and all that. but i do n't even know if free clinic even look at brain/memory disorder. that seems like a pretty big deal. something that wouldn't/should n't be free or discounted. so yeah , the memory loss thing and the family loss thing ... it 's scaring the ever loving crap out of me at the moment. but i have to be strong and let it ride. i 'm going to have fun while i can. i play drum ( hence the name ) and really , that 's the main thing that give me pleasure these day. just sitting down at the kit and playing my heart out on them. i 'm really having fun doing that. and , i also love my family but i feel bad that if i 'm gone within the next couple of year , that 'll devastate my wife and my daughter especially ... a well a my sister and my father. it 's scary! and in some way , i feel like i may be alienating them because i do n't want them to feel the devastation i feel now. i do n't know what to do ... where to turn ... if this memory loss thing is simple to fix with medicine then i 'm hoping i do n't miss that train without insurance and looking for a free clinic that wo n't be able to figure out what this is. i 've made a couple of call this week and i 'm waiting for someone to call me back. i will call them again tomorrow and find out where they 're at with this. but at the same time , i do n't want to worry myself to death ... literally!

and i completely recovered from that mind set in my time away from her , however recently a friend of mine said that she attended a new church and met said teacher there. according to my friend the teacher mentioned me and asked if i would attend the church. i think this sparked something in my brain because now everything feel like a sign again. however , all whilst i think these thing , i ’ m completely aware of how utterly delusional i sound… but they just make too much sense? ? ugh , i don ’ t know. i don ’ t know what to do. i feel like i probably need to be on some kind of medication but i also don ’ t want to go through the embarrassment of telling somebody about these thought in person. and even though i don ’ t believe my delusional thought , part of me want ’ s to “ wait and see ” what other sign i would receive if i went to the church and saw the teacher etc… i ’ d love advice or to hear anybody else ’ s similar experience , so i feel le alone : /",mentalhealth,classifiedwrites,False,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1dfkcxo/unsure_what_to_do/,0,1.0,0.0,2.1318188891944494e-06,"['topic', 'anxiety', 'paranoia', 'delusion', 'undiagnoised', 'family', 'history', 'bipolar', 'however', 'typically', 'show', 'sign', 'towards', 'bpd', 'experiencing', 'intense', 'anxiety', 'year', 'ha', 'gotten', 'progressively', 'worse', 'time', 'noticed', 'stopped', 'going', 'outside', 'day', 'time', 'seeing', 'anybody', 'first', 'wa', 'anxious', 'worried', 'would', 'embarrass', 'sick', 'panic', 'attack', 'public', 'avoided', 'noticed', 'recently', 'gotten', 'paranoid', 'every', 'time', 'around', 'somebody', 'feel', 'though', 'reading', 'mind', 'judging', 'everything', 'think', 'outside', 'night', 'usually', 'time', 'bring', 'feel', 'though', 'someone', 'following', 'waiting', 'hurt', 'people', 'staring', 'inside', 'house', 'wa', 'track', 'attend', 'university', 'september', 'however', 'self', 'destructing', 'isolating', 'basically', 'shutting', 'world', 'mum', 'live', 'ha', 'messaging', 'seems', 'quite', 'frustrated', 'tried', 'explain', 'situation', 'much', 'comfortably', 'could', 'think', 'understands', 'much', 'impacting', 'anything', 'anymore', 'sit', 'room', 'day', 'sort', 'feel', 'though', 'waiting', 'something', 'top', 'paranoia', 'recently', 'god', 'started', 'feeling', 'presence', 'originally', 'felt', 'though', 'wa', 'going', 'cure', 'however', 'escalated', 'quickly', 'delusion', 'old', 'teacher', 'fixated', 'context', 'year', 'ago', 'school', 'became', 'fixated', 'religious', 'study', 'teacher', 'believed', 'spiritual', 'connection', 'wa', 'destined', 'life', 'completely', 'recovered', 'mind', 'set', 'time', 'away', 'however', 'recently', 'friend', 'mine', 'said', 'attended', 'new', 'church', 'met', 'said', 'teacher', 'according', 'friend', 'teacher', 'mentioned', 'asked', 'would', 'attend', 'church', 'think', 'sparked', 'something', 'brain', 'everything', 'feel', 'like', 'sign', 'however', 'whilst', 'think', 'thing', 'completely', 'aware', 'utterly', 'delusional', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'ugh', 'know', 'know', 'feel', 'like', 'probably', 'need', 'kind', 'medication', 'also', 'want', 'go', 'embarrassment', 'telling', 'somebody', 'thought', 'person', 'even', 'though', 'believe', 'delusional', 'thought', 'part', 'want', 'wait', 'see', 'sign', 'would', 'receive', 'went', 'church', 'saw', 'teacher', 'love', 'advice', 'hear', 'anybody', 'else', 'similar', 'experience', 'feel', 'le', 'alone']","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.8399}",negative

shameful thing for me to admit and i do n't want people to ever find me saying this on the internet - but i figured since no one even know i use this account i figured why not ask now and then delete it later. but regardless , i need serious advice. how do you recover from being financially unstable and in debt? i have a full time job already but it 's just not cutting it ... and i 'm looking for a 2nd part-time job but i 've had zero luck so far because they need people who will be more flexible with their schedule , and because i already work 8-5 , it 's hard to find job that i can work at in the evening ( without it being a fast food restaurant ). my parent were n't ever really involved in my life and they never really explained the importance of being financially stable , being responsible with your credit card , etc. they are n't really supportive of my mental health either which is why i decided to post it here instead of some financial subreddit. if there 's another place i can post this pls lmk. but anyways , i let it get this bad because my depression is just ... so severe. and because my parent are so freakishly unsupportive of anything that 's remotely close to mental illness , i 've been untreated and i 've only seen about 2 therapist both of which have flopped. i did however see a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with bpd and ocd. i 'm 22 year old. i 've dealt with emotionally and mentally abusive parent for 10+ year , and i 've dealt with very toxic relationship that have drained me of me of my money. last year i wa very very suicidal and had a clear vision in my mind i wa going to commit suicide by the end of 2023 , and for month i wa very set on my decision. so i spent way too much money especially on my credit card because in my head i wa going to kill myself anyways so there wa no point in me trying to get ahold of myself. i 've thought about it many many time but i wa 100 % set with a plan to die at the end of 2023 since i have had nothing to live for , even myself. i made a lot of dumb decision financially because i truly believed it wa the end of my life and i wa honestly okay with that. obviously now it 's june 2024 and thing have happened and i 'm still alive and somehow surviving. i 'm somewhat better than before , considering i 've been in a really healthy relationship that 's given me some purpose , but i 'm still not okay at all. especially now dealing with the repercussion and consequence of my own action. i work full time monday-friday but the money i make right now is n't enough to cover the debt i have. i babysit every now and then and i 'm trying to look for a secondary job but i 've had no luck so far. and i 'm scared of overworking myself because then i 'm really just never gon na prioritize myself at all. i want to move out and better myself ( especially since the household i live in is one of the reason i 'm so fucked in the head ) but i have no money in my saving because everything just go towards my credit card and obviously my credit card debt is more than i can handle. i 'm just really stuck. i 'm not here to beg for money and i will never ask , all i 'm asking for is help and a direction on what to do. i have nobody in my life i can turn to about this and i just do n't know what to

4 month in , but now the last 4 i won ’ t see him at all. i can ’ t even speak to him because he ’ s not allowed his phone. i ’ ve had severe attachment issue my whole life and have probably cried a total of imma say 100 hour over this. i used to have really bad panic attack. found out a few month after my boyfriend left that my only grandparent , that i ’ m close with suddenly ha stage 4 lung cancer and ha 3 month left to live. she wa in remission and considered cancer free last summer and then bam. she ’ s going downhill so fast , they just put her on the oxygen mask and it ’ s terrifying. this is the first death i will have to deal with ever and i don ’ t know how i ’ m going to get through it without my person with me. a few week ago i stopped being friend with my only friend because she hasn ’ t given me any support whatsoever in the past 4 month. i have to beg her to hangout with me even though she ’ s my literal next door neighbour. on top of that i work 50 hour a week and she work 15 and yet she can ’ t find time for me. i live with my two sister , niece , and mom. my one sister which is my best friend work the opposite shift a me so we don ’ t see eachother at all , only on weekend. i get off late and when i get home everyone ’ s usually asleep or too tired to spend time with me. i ’ m constantly alone. i have no one to text , and can ’ t make friend that i feel comfortable with. i just hate people and always feel judged so i don ’ t like letting people in , i ’ ve also never met anyone other than my partner that genuinely is interested in me a a person and deeply care for me. i just miss him so much. and the cherry on top is how much i hate my fucking job but can ’ t leave it because i won ’ t get the kind of pay i do anywhere else. i work so far from home and am constantly gone , when i ’ m home i deprive myself of basic need such a eating because i don ’ t want to waste my free time , i ’ m also chronically lazy. if i didn ’ t have to look presentable for work i ’ d probably shower once a week. i also rarely have an appetite and actually have a hard time eating in general because i ’ m always running on empty. i usually eat once every two day , i try to go for atleast once a day which is good for me but only if it ’ s a full meal , which it usually isn ’ t. i ’ m not constantly sad , but everytime i ’ m alone and have time to think , i am. even the small thing like how i ’ m too lazy to eat make me extra sad because it feel pathetic. and just extremely depressing. i ’ ve lost 20 pound since my boyfriend left. i honestly just want someone to talk to me and try to support me and maybe give me some idea on how to get my shit together. even if you can ’ t give me any help/advice , support would be nice. i honestly even feel pathetic posting this because i know what i ’ m going through isn ’ t that bad , but i just genuinely have no one to talk to and really needed to type it all out for someone to read and

2024-06-13 14:52:43,1813,Thought I witnessed my cat die,1,1.0,"i wa coming home late from the gym the other night , and saw a fox biting on a cat in the middle of the road , so ran over and scared the fox off. looked down and noticed ( at that moment ) it wa my cat. neck sliced and blood pouring out , motionless but she wa still warm. it wa around midnight , and so nobody wa around , and i did n't know what to do. i felt myself start to tear up , gently stroking her , apologising for not getting there quicker , apologising for not letting her on my lap the previous day. she looked so defenseless and harmless laying there , and it did n't make sense that something so cute and harmless had such a violent exit in the world. i started to cry , because of what she went through , and how guilty i felt , and how much is will hurt my family when i tell them. i stood over her , diverting the odd car that came by. some people stopped and asked , i answered , and they showed compassion , and i felt bad that they felt bad they could n't 'help '. after about 15 minute standing over her in the rain , i mustered up the courage to take my jumper off and pick her up to carry her home. after a few attempt , and constantly muttering 'sorry ' to her , i carried her back home. she wa the daughter of our older cat , and i wa terrified to go into the house and bring this news. i went in , went upstairs and woke my parent up a i did n't know what to do , through whimper and light cry , i told them i found her dead on the street ( all whilst holding her in the dark in my arm ). they were obviously confused and upset , and we went downstairs , only to find my cat by the backdoor- pawing to get out. i realised i had brought a random dead cat home. laughing , cry , confused , angry , stunned. i wa feeling everything. very fortunate that it wa not my cat , but very sorry that it wa someone else 's. i had felt like i had to go through the stage of grief just to pick her up and carry her home and move forward , only to find out that it wa n't my cat. after calming down , and questioning whether i 'm an idiot for not recognising it wa n't my cat , i showed a picture to my family , and they were all certain they would have mistaken her for our cat aswell. i didnt realise i felt so strongly for my pet. i knew i cared and loved her etc , but it wa a large shock to what extent. perhaps it wa the situation that made it worse. this happend 3 day ago , and still i do n't feel emotionally back to normal. i kept telling myself when i wa out there in the road , trying to pick her up , that it 's 'just a cat ' , 'just pick her up ' , 'stop being overdramatic and just do it , you ca n't leave her out here '. do n't really know why i 'm posting it here , but it wa just

figured i could maybe use some kind word or hope if you have any to spare. i ’ m out of them myself. i ’ ll finish the post in edits due to length. ~~ i ’ ve been an addict of some sort since i wa 15 year old. it started with little white lie and leading a double life out of fear of coming out a trans , evolving into alcohol to cope a a young adult. by the time i finished college , i wa taking and abusing pill and meth on a semi-regular basis , and i wa a full-blown opioid addict by the time i wa 26. eventually , i sobered up , started aa , and turned my life around , hitting a year of sobriety. throughout all of it , one of my best friend , kyle ( name ha been changed ) stood by my side. for context , i had previously developed romantic feeling for kyle and wa shot down in the kindest of way , and over time we got closer and closer and became a close of friend a friend could be. my feeling for him never faded , but i just kept them to myself , always respecting his boundary and never wanting to ruin what we had. a few week ago , i started struggling with my sobriety. i felt the joy of my day to day life starting to slip through my finger , and the pressure of recovery wa becoming too much to handle. but because my life wa going “ so great ” , i started having to look for reason to justify relapsing ; at least , that ’ s my theory for why i did what happens next. one night , i invited kyle over to my house to watch a movie and hang out. the entire time we ’ re together , i only had two thought going through my head : that i wa in love with him , and that i wanted to get high more than anything in the world. i ’ ll spare all of the boring detail of u hanging out , but a he wa leaving and i hugged him goodbye , i did the very thing i wa determined never to do and i kissed him , crossing that boundary. he texted me the next day that he wasn ’ t mad at me but that he needed time to build trust back in our friendship. later on , instead of taking responsibility and his feeling into account for the fact that i crossed the line and broke his trust , i doubled down. i became needy and obsessive. i posted online about how heartbroken and in love i wa. i wrote poetry about him and sent it to him. i hounded him with confession of my feeling. i treated him like an object. deep down , i knew that i either needed him to fix me or i needed him to hurt me enough to break me. and then it happened. after a few day of silence , he texted me and told me how everything i did and wa doing made him feel and that he didn ’ t want me to reply or speak to him. i did what i sought out to do and i lost my best friend. everything inside of me shattered. and that night , i wiped and deleted all of my social medium , turned off my phone ’ s texting , drove into the city , and relapsed in a parking lot in my car. it all happened so fast it wa like a blur. every ounce of pain and regret and sorrow and fear i had been pushing down the last year instead of actually facing in recovery came surging back up a i vomited out the back door of my car. the three minute i wa high. .. i don ’ t even remember them. i completely blacked out and woke up after hour of nodding off , realizing what i ’ d done. i drove home , got some sleep , went to an aa meeting , and left again to try and find a treatment center , only to be turned away at every step. so here i am , exactly 8 day since the night i kissed kyle. i ’ ve been using every day since that first night i relapsed. it took me a week and a day to lose my best friend , my sobriety , my job , my family ’ s trust , and probably a ton of other thing i can ’ t even think of right now. i ’ m too scared to turn my texting back on. i ’ m too scared to download social medium again. right now. .. i exist in a bubble , isolated in the confines of my car. i doubt anyone is looking for me , but if they are , i truly don ’ t think i want to be found like this. part of me want to recover so badly and claw my way out of this so i can fix thing with him. another part of me want to go on to the end of this because i deserve it. but either way , no matter what happens , i feel so much regret for putting him through all of what i did. i made him a pawn in a game he never signed up for and i used him a a mean to justify my own self-destruction. i want to make amends with him but i don ’ t even know where i would start. i wish i could take it all back. i wish he had never had to meet someone like me. i don ’ t know what ’ s going to happen to me , so i guess i just needed to confess my sin out loud while i still can. if you ’ re reading this and you ’ re struggling with addiction and thinking about getting help , please do. recovery is a beautiful thing , and one of my deepest hope is that it work for others better than it did for me. if you made it to the end , thank you for reading. i hope you don ’ t judge me too harshly , but i understand if you do. i don ’ t deserve sympathy. but if you have any to spare , i could really use some kind word. i have none left of my own. thank

a conversation with a friend , i thought i 'd share what keep me alive in my darkest moment. a bit of background ; i struggle with bipolar disorder , adhd and ptsd. i have numerous year of intense trauma and i suffer with the symptom of ptsd everyday a a result. i 'm also currently going through a depressive episode that kind of took me by surprise so it 's been heavy day for sure. but there have been many heavy and dark day , and for some reason i 've decided to stick around even when i have struggled to articulate why. i think i 'm finally able to. i hope this help or is at least semi-interesting. i got into the whole manifestation train a few year back , and although i do n't believe in it now i did gain one valuable skill from it ; imagination. i mean the kind of extremely detailed intentional imagination , not an abstract fantacy. i use it to imagine , in detail ( sound , smell , sensation on my skin , building , weather etc. ) what my life would look like if i did n't suffer so acutely with bipolar and ptsd. who would i be? what would i sound like? what would my interest be? what kind of friend would i have? what would my apartment look like? what would my curtain look like? i mean in extreme detail , i have to be able to recall it a if it wa a place i 'd actually been. sometimes i 'll write it down or take a voice note if my brain is struggling to hold on to detail , but usually the image and the emotion it conjures up is enough. i 'm not a mental health professional so i ca n't explain exactly how this , frankly made up , image creates a sense of longing , but it doe. this longing will usually stay with me for a while. sometimes it 'll make me sad ( because it 's not my reality ) and sometimes it will make me angry ( that i even have to imagine such a seemingly mundane existence ). and in those feeling i 'm able to process the pain i 'm currently experiencing. it allows the feeling to come to the surface , and i can cry , i can write , i can stare at a wall and contemplate , it 's different every time. but after a few day , the image will be almost like a memory ( i 'll obviously know i imagined this some day ago , and somehow ( again , i 'm not an expert ) , the image will become a kind of memory making it feel like something different than an imagination. not quite a real memory , not quite a figment of my imagination. the feeling i feel when i think about it is real. the effort i took to conjure up the image is real , so the image becomes it own kind of not-real but still real thing. this feeling of attachment to the image will usually be enough to spark even a mustard seed of hope. not enough to suddenly be cured of depression , and not even enough to stop my unhealthy coping skill. but enough to want to believe that it \ * can\ * be real. often time that desire for it to be real , will be enough to take tiny step. a shower , a dish wash up , a reply to a friend or even searching up mental health professional on tiktok

weight on my heart .. also i feel like i ca n't interact with people anymore i know a couple of girl but i just feel like they arent my type but also i cant feel like anyone is my type ( really do n't mean to speak lowly of them but imma explain in a bit ) they do n't seem interested in anything i like and i tend to speak enthusiasticly about thing i like but then their vibe is such a turn off so i just ditch them and no longer speak to them again but then they just come saying that i do n't care about them and blame me for other thing but i really ca n't do effort once i 'm turned off from something ( i really hope somebody tell me if what i am doing is right but i really feel so bad when i do n't get matching vibe about what i like it turn me off so much but also idk if it 's something wrong with me because nobody ever really cared about what i love ) that like one part of the problem the other part is that i hate how woman deal so much they just want all the attention and give nothing in return but again that could be me because i ca n't feel anything , one girl say she love me so much but i still do n't feel anything it just make me extra dull and sad .... now this part is far from the girl part it 's more about me i hate life so much i find that people do such very stupid thing i ca n't tolerate i really hate being around people i hate hearing about them i see their is alot of bad thing in the world people die and get killed people fight with each other for no reason i ca n't really tolerate this world neither do i wan na see it get anybetter idk why but sometimes i wish i could watch the world just burn with all that bad shit in it i 'm sorry if i am being offending to anyone i really did n't wan na share thing up but i have noone , i do n't share anything with
